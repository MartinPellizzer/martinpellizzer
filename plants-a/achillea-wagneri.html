                <h1>Achillea wagneri</h1>
<p>Achillea wagneri, commonly known as Wagner's yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features gray-green, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of tiny white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice in gardens for its hardiness and attractive appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea wagneri has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a gray-green color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stems are cylindrical, hairy, and have a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a cylindrical achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>
