<p>Actinodaphne monantha, commonly known as the fragrant sandalwood tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored timber, which is highly valued for its scent and durability. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, round berries.</p>
<p>The tree is often cultivated for its essential oils and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne monantha has elliptic to ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows upright with a dense branching pattern. The flowers are small, fragrant, and clustered in spikes, featuring yellowish-white petals and a distinct, three-lobed calyx, blooming during the wet season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a spherical drupe, turning red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network underground, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne monantha is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, primarily found in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of southern China, India, and the Andaman Islands, though its range has become fragmented due to habitat loss. It thrives in humid lowland rainforests, often growing along riverbanks and in secondary forest areas. This species is typically found at altitudes between 200 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Despite its ecological importance, Actinodaphne monantha is listed as vulnerable due to deforestation and overexploitation for timber and traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne monantha is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, known for its fragrant leaves and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 5â€“10 years, making it suitable for long-term landscaping.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires consistent moisture without waterlogging. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the tree are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract scale insects or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-tolerant species like ferns or orchids can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a tropical garden.</p>
