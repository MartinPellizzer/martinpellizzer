                <h1>Actinodaphne monantha</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne monantha, commonly known as the single-flowered actinodaphne, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and is often found in secondary vegetation. Its bark and leaves are used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat for various organisms.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne monantha has simple, lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a fragrant scent, blooming during the rainy season, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne monantha is primarily native to the Indian subcontinent, including countries such as India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in forested areas and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with evergreen and semi-evergreen forests. Its distribution extends into parts of Southeast Asia, including Myanmar and parts of peninsular Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is typically found at low to moderate elevations, often in secondary growth habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne monantha was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its fragrant leaves and potential medicinal properties. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species.</p>
