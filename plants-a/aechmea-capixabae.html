<p>Aechmea capixabae, commonly known as the Capixaba bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of long, narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central tank to collect water and nutrients. The plant produces vibrant orange to red inflorescences, which are composed of numerous small, showy flowers. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and provide a habitat for microorganisms.</p>
<p>Aechmea capixabae thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea capixabae has leaves that are sword-shaped, arranged in a rosette, with a dark green color and a waxy texture, reaching up to 50 cm in length.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, thick stem with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by brightly colored bracts, with flowers that are predominantly red and orange, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by birds. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that disperses seeds through wind and animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense mat around the base of the plant, helping to anchor it and absorb nutrients.</p>
