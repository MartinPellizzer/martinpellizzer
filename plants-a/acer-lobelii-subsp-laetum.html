                <h1>Acer lobelii subsp. laetum</h1>
<p>Acer lobelii subsp.</p>
<p>laetum, commonly known as the showy maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are often brightly colored in the fall, ranging from yellow to orange.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and landscape design.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer lobelii subsp.</p>
<p>laetum has palmately lobed leaves that are typically three-lobed, with a deep green color on the upper surface and a lighter green or slightly hairy underside. The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and has a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, blooming in early spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer lobelii subsp.</p>
<p>laetum is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States, specifically found in California and Nevada. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations within the Sierra Nevada mountain range.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. It typically grows at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss and climate change, it is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer lobelii subsp.</p>
<p>laetum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and unique growth habits. It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination.</p>
<p>This species grows best in USDA hardiness zones 5-8, entering a dormant phase in winter and actively growing during spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its form, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases, though aphids and scale insects may occasionally infest it.</p>
<p>Companion planting with native grasses or shrubs can enhance its ecological benefits and aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer lobelii subsp.</p>
<p>laetum is a small deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity and soil health. Its dense foliage helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer lobelii subsp.</p>
<p>laetum is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary or medicinal use due to its small size and specific habitat. It is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal, making it a potential candidate for horticultural applications in specialized gardens.</p>
<p>While it does not have significant industrial or economic importance, its presence in native ecosystems contributes to biodiversity and ecological balance. In cultural contexts, it may hold symbolic value for indigenous communities that rely on local flora.</p>
<p>Overall, its role is more ecological and aesthetic than utilitarian in traditional applications.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer lobelii subsp.</p>
<p>laetum has several popular cultivars, such as 'Aureum' and 'Variegatum', which are prized for their striking foliage colors. It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, leading to cultivars like 'Emerald Queen' and 'Autumnalis' that exhibit enhanced ornamental traits.</p>
<p>These hybrids often display more vibrant autumn colors and improved adaptability to different climates. Horticulturally, Acer lobelii subsp. laetum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids contribute to the diversity of maples used in landscaping and botanical collections.</p>
