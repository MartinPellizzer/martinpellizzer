                    <h1>Agrostis compressa</h1>
<p>Agrostis compressa, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly compressed, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Agrostis compressa is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas where it can stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
