                <h1>Aconitum napellus f. latisectum</h1>
<p>Aconitum napellus f. latisectum, commonly known as the Broad-leaved Monkshood, is a hybrid form of the European monkshood.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in tall, spire-like clusters. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe and thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum napellus f. latisectum has large, broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a silver-white underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and somewhat hairy, with a dark purple-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The flowers are showy, blue to violet, bell-shaped, and clustered in racemes, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, adapted for absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum napellus f. latisectum is a variant of the European aconite, native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Germany, Austria, and the Czech Republic, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It typically grows in woodlands, meadows, and stream sides, preferring well-drained soils. This species is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as vulnerable in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aconitum napellus f. latisectum is a striking perennial plant known for its large, showy blue or purple flowers and broad, deeply cut foliage.</p>
