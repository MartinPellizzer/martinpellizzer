                <h1>Achillea djimilensis</h1>
<p>Achillea djimilensis, commonly known as the Djimilense yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features finely divided, silver-green foliage that is often aromatic, and its flowers bloom in flat, spherical clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea djimilensis has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a silver-gray upper surface and a darker green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slightly hairy, and has a grayish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flower heads are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The plant produces small, dry fruits called achene, which are dispersed by wind due to their feathery pappus.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and extensive, helping it anchor in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea djimilensis is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Mediterranean, specifically found in parts of Syria and Lebanon.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed in limited areas within its native range, with some populations also cultivated in botanical gardens. This plant thrives in dry, rocky environments and is commonly found in open habitats such as slopes and grasslands. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea djimilensis is considered a vulnerable species and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea djimilensis is a hardy perennial plant known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late winter. This plant has a long growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and maintaining its foliage throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot if care is not taken.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea djimilensis is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering both food and shelter. The plant acts as a companion plant in local ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its presence. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and supporting biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea djimilensis is a lesser-known plant that has limited documented uses and applications.</p>
<p>It is primarily found in specific regions and has not been widely utilized in culinary practices. In terms of medicinal applications, there is limited research on its potential health benefits, though it may share some properties with other members of the Asteraceae family. Its industrial and economic significance remains unclear due to its rarity and lack of commercial cultivation.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic value in local traditions, though this is not well-documented.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea djimilensis has several varieties and cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aurea' and 'Marginata', which are known for their striking yellow and green foliage. While there are limited hybrids specifically developed for Achillea djimilensis, it is often crossed with other yarrow species to create new cultivars with enhanced traits. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in poor soils and its long-lasting flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>This plant is a valuable addition to rock gardens and borders, offering both aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
