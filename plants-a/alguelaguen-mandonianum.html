                    <h1>Alguelaguen mandonianum</h1>
<p>Alguelaguen mandonianum, commonly known as the golden spire orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a vibrant touch to its alpine habitat. The plant has a compact, upright growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in cool, humid conditions and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
