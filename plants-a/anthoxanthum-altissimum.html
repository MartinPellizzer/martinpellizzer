<p>Anthoxanthum altissimum, commonly known as the tall oat or false oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous florets. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces pale yellow to brown flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it can form dense stands.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
