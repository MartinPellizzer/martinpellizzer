                <h1>Aconitum oligocarpum</h1>
<p>Aconitum oligocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense spikes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>Aconitum oligocarpum contains toxic alkaloids, making it a potentially dangerous plant to handle or ingest.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum oligocarpum has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a rough texture and a size ranging from 10 to 20 centimeters in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes more rugged as the plant matures. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense spikes, and have five petals with a spurred lower petal; they bloom in late summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle containing numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and attached parachutes.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, storing nutrients and allowing the plant to survive harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum oligocarpum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes where the climate is cold and arid. This plant is commonly found in the Pamir and Tien Shan mountain ranges, where it adapts to the harsh environmental conditions. It prefers well-drained soils and is often associated with alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum oligocarpum was mainly introduced to North America through human activities, including horticultural trade and intentional cultivation.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. The plant has become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the eastern United States. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential invasiveness and toxicity.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
