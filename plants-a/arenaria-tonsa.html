<p>Arenaria tonsa, commonly known as sand sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowers are typically white or pink, appearing in clusters. It is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where temperatures are cold and the growing season is short.</p>
<p>Arenaria tonsa plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
