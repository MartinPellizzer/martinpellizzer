<p>Asplenium eburneum, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a delicate and ornamental fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening and rockeries.</p>
