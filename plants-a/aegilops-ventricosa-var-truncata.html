<p>Aegilops ventricosa var. truncata, commonly known as the truncated spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, truncate (cut-off) spikelets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, pale green flowers in summer.</p>
