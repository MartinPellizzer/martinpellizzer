                        <h1>Acer campestre f. molle</h1>
<p>Acer campestre f. molle, commonly known as the soft-leaved field maple, is a variant of the field maple tree native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, thin leaves that are typically lighter in color compared to the standard species.
