<p>Atriplex glabriuscula var. acadiensis, commonly known as coastal saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It features succulent, gray-green leaves with a waxy coating that reduces water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. It thrives in coastal areas, marshes, and saline soils, often serving as a stabilizer for dunes.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
