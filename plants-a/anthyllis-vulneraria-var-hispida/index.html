                            <h1>Anthyllis Vulneraria Var. Hispida</h1>
<p>Common bird's-foot trefoil, scientifically known as Anthyllis vulneraria var. hispida, is a low-growing flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is recognized for its distinctive seed pods that resemble a bird's foot, hence its common name. This hardy species thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and rocky areas. Its yellow flowers bloom in early summer, attracting a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Despite its modest appearance, the plant plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity and stabilizing soil in various habitats.</p>
