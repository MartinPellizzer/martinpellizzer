<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that are typically arranged in racemes, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits, and the plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda carthaginensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a pointed tip and a heart-shaped base, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually 5–10 cm long and 2–5 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The stem is slender, cylindrical, and somewhat woody, with a rough, bark-like texture that is typically light brown to gray in color. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, and have a white or pale pink color, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
