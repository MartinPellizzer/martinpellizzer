<p>The species is characterized by its woody structure and ability to thrive in humid, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax baviensis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of northern Vietnam, specifically in the province of Lao Cai.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in temperate forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and is sometimes found in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax baviensis was mainly introduced to areas with temperate to subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
