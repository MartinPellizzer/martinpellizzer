<p>Androcymbium roseum subsp.</p>
<p>albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered roseum, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink to white flowers with a distinctive, elongated spur.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in high-altitude alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
