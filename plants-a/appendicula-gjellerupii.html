                    <h1>Appendicula gjellerupii</h1>
<p>Appendicula gjellerupii, commonly known as the Arctic sandwort, is a small flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adapting to the harsh, cold environments it inhabits. Its leaves are often succulent, helping it retain moisture in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Appendicula gjellerupii is well-suited to rocky or sandy substrates and is often found in tundra and mountainous regions.</p>
