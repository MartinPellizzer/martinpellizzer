                        <h1>Abolboda acicularis</h1>
<p>Abolboda acicularis, commonly known as the slender leaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is typically found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Due to its low water requirements, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
