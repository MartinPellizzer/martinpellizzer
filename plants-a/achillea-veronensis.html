                <h1>Achillea veronensis</h1>
<p>Achillea veronensis, commonly known as the Verona yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage consists of finely divided, gray-green leaves, and it produces white to pale yellow flowers in summer.</p>
<p>It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea veronensis has basal leaves that are lanceolate, with a greyish-blue color and a woolly texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a growth pattern that is mostly herbaceous. The flowers are composite, consisting of ray florets that are white or pale yellow, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea veronensis is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe, specifically Italy and parts of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is now found in scattered populations across its former range, with some records in southern France and northern Africa. This species thrives in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky slopes, often in disturbed or marginal habitats. It typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea veronensis is considered a rare plant and is listed as endangered in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea veronensis is a perennial flowering plant known for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The plant has a growth cycle that involves active growth in spring, flowering in late spring to early summer, and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea veronensis is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, which contribute to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. Additionally, its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Achillea veronensis also plays a role in improving soil health by attracting beneficial microorganisms.</p>
