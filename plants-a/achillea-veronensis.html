                <h1>Achillea veronensis</h1>
<p>Achillea veronensis, commonly known as Veronese yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. It is often used in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice in gardens and landscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea veronensis has basal leaves that are lanceolate, gray-green in color, and arranged in a rosette, with a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a reddish-brown color, growing from the base and branching sparingly. The flowers are composite, with yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea veronensis is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Italy, France, and parts of Spain.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky or limestone soils in coastal and inland areas. This plant thrives in sunny, well-drained environments and is often seen in open habitats such as slopes and grasslands. It is also present in southern Europe, including parts of Greece and the Balkans.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other regions with similar climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea veronensis was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since been reported in several states, particularly in the western United States, where it has established populations in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant's ability to spread through seeds and rhizomes has contributed to its rapid establishment in non-native habitats. While it is not considered highly invasive, its presence has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to outcompete native flora.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to monitor and control its spread in sensitive ecosystems.</p>
