<p>Acer calcaratum, commonly known as the rock maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped bark and its palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in dry, exposed areas.</p>
<p>Its compact size and ornamental value make it a popular choice for small gardens and landscapes.</p>
