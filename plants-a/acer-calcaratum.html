                        <h1>Acer calcaratum</h1>
<p>Acer calcaratum, commonly known as the rock maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped bark and its palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in dry, exposed areas.</p>
<p>Its compact size and ornamental value make it a popular choice for small gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acer calcaratum belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and diverse reproductive structures. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with a wide range of floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Sapindales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have simple leaves and showy flowers, often associated with tropical and subtropical regions. Its family is Sapindaceae, commonly known as the soapberry family, which includes trees and shrubs with distinctive fruits and often aromatic leaves. Its genus is Acer, commonly known as maples, which are deciduous trees or shrubs known for their opposite leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acer calcaratum, a specific type of maple native to certain regions of Asia, characterized by its unique leaf shape and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer calcaratum is primarily native to Assam, China South-Central, East Himalaya, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, West Himalaya.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates with well-drained soils. The plant is often associated with forested landscapes in these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution spans across several countries in South and Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer calcaratum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and moderate climates, often found in rocky or limestone-rich regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks for its ornamental value, particularly its colorful autumn foliage. This plant prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>However, its spread is generally limited due to its specific habitat requirements and slower growth rate.</p>
