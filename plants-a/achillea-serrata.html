<p>Achillea serrata, commonly known as the serrated yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely serrated leaves and flat, composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to white, and it produces small, achene-like seeds.</p>
<p>Achillea serrata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>

<p>Achillea serrata has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, serrated along the edges, and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5â€“10 cm long, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, and bloom from late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
