<p>It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in heathlands and coastal regions, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Acmadenia trigona is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to different environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmadenia trigona has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy green in color, with a slightly hairy texture on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, pale greyish-brown bark that peels in thin layers.

<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within the Cape Provinces.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia trigona was mainly introduced to urban and suburban gardens in Australia for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for landscaping in coastal and temperate climates.
