                    <h1>Athyrium × calophyllum</h1>
<p>Athyrium × calophyllum, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a hybrid fern that exhibits a combination of characteristics from its parent species, Athyrium and Calamoglossum.</p>
<p>It is native to Japan and is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and gold. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
<p>The fronds are deciduous, turning bronze in the fall before shedding, which adds seasonal interest to the landscape.</p>
