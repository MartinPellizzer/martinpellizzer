<p>Andrachne naikii, commonly known as the Naikii sandmat, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Andrachne naikii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
