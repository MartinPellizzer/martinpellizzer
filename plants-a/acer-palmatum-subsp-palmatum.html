<p>Acer palmatum subsp.</p>
<p>palmatum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves that change color throughout the seasons, often displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows to a height of 3â€“8 meters, with a rounded crown and branching pattern. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming more fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum subsp.</p>
<p>palmatum has finely dissected, palmate leaves that are typically lobed and arranged alternately along the stem, with a vibrant green color that turns brilliant red or orange in autumn. The stem is slender with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age, and it grows upright with a graceful, weeping form.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod that disperses by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Overall, it is a striking ornamental tree known for its delicate foliage and seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
