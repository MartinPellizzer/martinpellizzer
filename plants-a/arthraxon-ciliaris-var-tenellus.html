                    <h1>Arthraxon ciliaris var. tenellus</h1>
<p>Arthraxon ciliaris var. tenellus, commonly known as the slender spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, hair-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in sandy or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a groundcover in restoration projects.</p>
