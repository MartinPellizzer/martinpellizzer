                    <h1>Acer brachystephanum</h1>
<p>Acer brachystephanum, commonly known as the short-step maple, is a species of deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
