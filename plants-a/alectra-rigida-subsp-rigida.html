<p>Alectra rigida subsp.</p>
<p>rigida, commonly known as the rigid lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a unique combination of fungal and algal components. It typically forms a crustose thallus, which adheres tightly to the substrate, often found on bark or stone in forested areas.</p>
<p>The plant's structure is characterized by a dense, leathery growth that is resistant to environmental stressors. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used as an indicator species for forest health.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is relatively uncommon and has a limited geographic distribution.</p>
