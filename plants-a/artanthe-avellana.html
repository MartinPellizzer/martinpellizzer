                    <h1>Artanthe avellana</h1>
<p>Artanthe avellana, commonly known as the silverleaf artanthe, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine, soft hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
