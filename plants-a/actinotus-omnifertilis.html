<p>It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while the fruit is a capsule that releases numerous small seeds.</p>
<p>Actinotus omnifertilis is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting local pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>

<p>The stem is slender, covered in a smooth, light green bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
