                <h1>Acridocarpus vivy</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus vivy, commonly known as the slender flame tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves and showy, clustered orange-red flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The tree is also valued for its durable wood and medicinal properties in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus vivy has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern and measure approximately 5â€“8 cm in length. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, with a structure consisting of five petals and stamens, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus vivy is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the unique ecosystems of the island, which is known for its high levels of endemism. It thrives in the humid and tropical climates that characterize much of Madagascar's landscape. The species is commonly found in forested areas, particularly in the eastern and southern parts of the country.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus vivy was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and potential for erosion control.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since spread throughout various regions of the country. The plant thrives in coastal and lowland areas, where it often grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Although it is not considered invasive, its distribution has expanded beyond its original introduction sites.</p>
<p>It is now found in several regions, including the North Island and parts of the South Island.</p>
