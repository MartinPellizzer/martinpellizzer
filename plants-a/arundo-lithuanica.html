                    <h1>Arundo lithuanica</h1>
<p>Arundo lithuanica, commonly known as the Lithuanian reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, riverbanks, and marshy areas, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces tall, cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, greenish flowers. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, but it can outcompete native vegetation in certain habitats.</p>
