                <h1>Achoriphragma asperrimum</h1>
<p>Achoriphragma asperrimum, commonly known as the rough-hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and stiff, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches.</p>
<p>Achoriphragma asperrimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma asperrimum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a rough, hairy surface and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in a rough, ridged bark that is dark brown in color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensively branched, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma asperrimum is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Sonora. This plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in desert and semi-arid environments. It is well adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in areas with low precipitation.</p>
<p>Its native range includes both the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma asperrimum was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its unique and attractive appearance.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southwestern regions, particularly in Texas and New Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. This plant has become naturalized in some areas, posing a potential risk to native vegetation by competing for resources. Its introduction has led to increased monitoring efforts by environmental agencies to prevent its spread into non-native habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, land managers caution against its cultivation due to its invasive potential.</p>
