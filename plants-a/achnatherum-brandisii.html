                <h1>Achnatherum brandisii</h1>
<p>Achnatherum brandisii, commonly known as Brandis' needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, spikelets.</p>
<p>Achnatherum brandisii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum brandisii has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically flat, linear, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slight waxy coating.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and has a smooth, pale green to reddish-brown bark, growing in dense clumps or tufts. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, with small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer; they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, three-angled achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum brandisii is primarily native to Afghanistan, China North-Central, China South-Central, East Himalaya, Nepal, Pakistan, Qinghai, Tibet, West Himalaya.</p>
<p>This grass species is commonly found in alpine and subalpine regions across these areas. It thrives in rocky and mountainous environments, often growing at high elevations. The plant is well adapted to the cold and arid conditions typical of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution spans a wide geographic area across central and southern Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum brandisii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in states like California, Nevada, and Oregon.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. This species is often found in areas with low precipitation and well-drained soils. Its introduction has been primarily through human activities, including accidental transport via vehicles or machinery.</p>
<p>While it is not considered invasive, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
