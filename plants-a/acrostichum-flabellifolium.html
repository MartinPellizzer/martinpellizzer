                <h1>Acrostichum flabellifolium</h1>
<p>Acrostichum flabellifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and swamps. Its fronds are composed of numerous small, lance-shaped pinnae that are arranged in a distinctive, almost fan-like pattern.</p>
<p>The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum flabellifolium has large, pinnately compound leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a bright green color and a smooth texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, blooming in early summer, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are lightweight and adapted for aerial dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum flabellifolium is primarily native to the tropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and swampy areas. This fern is commonly found in countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. It prefers humid climates with high rainfall and is often associated with riverbanks and dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the Neotropical region, where it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum flabellifolium was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as along roadsides, in abandoned fields, and near water bodies. This plant has been reported in several regions of the southeastern United States, including Florida and Georgia. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes used in landscaping.</p>
