<p>Acrostichum flabellifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and swamps. Its fronds are composed of numerous small, lance-shaped pinnae that are arranged in a distinctive, almost fan-like pattern.</p>
<p>The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
