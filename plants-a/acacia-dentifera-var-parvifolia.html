                        <h1>Acacia dentifera var. parvifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia dentifera var. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, pointed leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished from the typical A. dentifera by its smaller, more delicate leaves.</p>
