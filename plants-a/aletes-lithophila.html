                    <h1>Aletes lithophila</h1>
<p>Aletes lithophila, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and unique plant native to the rocky habitats of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows on limestone or basalt substrates, often in crevices or on rock faces. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct, intricate structure typical of orchids. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the rocky environment, and it often forms symbiotic relationships with specific fungi.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, Aletes lithophila is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
