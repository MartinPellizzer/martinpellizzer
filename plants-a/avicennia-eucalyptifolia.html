                <h1>Avicennia eucalyptifolia</h1>
<p>Avicennia eucalyptifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant exhibits succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in high-salinity conditions. It is typically found in coastal areas, such as estuaries and tidal flats, across the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
