                <h1>Acianthera luteola</h1>
<p>Acianthera luteola, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shady, moist environments such as forest floors or undergrowth. Its leaves are elongated and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem.</p>
<p>Acianthera luteola is notable for its fragrant blooms and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera luteola has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a creeping growth pattern. Its flowers are clustered in racemes, featuring yellow petals and a slender, tubular shape, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera luteola is primarily native to Brazil South and Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This orchid species is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the Atlantic Forest biome. The plant is typically associated with rocky outcrops and forest understories.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera luteola was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including gardens, roadsides, and urban environments. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it adaptable to a variety of soil types. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via seeds contribute to its success in introduced regions.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it has been established.</p>
