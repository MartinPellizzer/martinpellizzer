                    <h1>Amygdalus sporadum</h1>
<p>Amygdalus sporadum, commonly known as the sporadic almond, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Prunus genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by the development of small, edible nuts. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is native to specific regions in the Mediterranean. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a slightly serrated edge, and the bark is smooth and grayish in color.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amygdalus sporadum is considered a botanically interesting but endangered species.</p>
