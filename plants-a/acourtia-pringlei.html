                <h1>Acourtia pringlei</h1>
<p>Acourtia pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Acourtia pringlei is a herbaceous perennial that produces a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia pringlei has small, hairy, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly woody, and has a pale green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its flowers are small, white to pinkish, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom from spring to early summer, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia pringlei is primarily native to Mexico Central and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This species is found in the central and southwestern regions of Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is adapted to the specific climate and soil conditions of these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these areas, making it a regionally significant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia pringlei was mainly introduced to coastal dunes and sandy soils in California.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with full sun and well-drained soil conditions. This plant is often found in disturbed habitats, such as along roadsides and near human settlements. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several coastal regions of the state.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species and has not been widely studied for its ecological impact.</p>
