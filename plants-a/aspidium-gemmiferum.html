<p>Aspidium gemmiferum, commonly known as the gemmiferous water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dennstaedtiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae. The plant produces spores in sori located on the underside of its fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Aspidium gemmiferum is also known for its ability to propagate through gemmae, small vegetative buds that can develop into new plants.</p>
