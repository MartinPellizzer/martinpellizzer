<p>Aspidium humile, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a small, delicate fern native to various regions in Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, humus-rich soil. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups.</p>
<p>Aspidium humile is often used in ornamental gardening due to its elegant appearance and ability to thrive in indoor conditions.</p>
