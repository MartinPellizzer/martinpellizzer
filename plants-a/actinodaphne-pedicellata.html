                <h1>Actinodaphne pedicellata</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne pedicellata, commonly known as the hairy-leafed laurel, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval, fleshy berries. Its bark and leaves contain essential oils, which have been used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne pedicellata has elliptical to ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a light brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a sweet fragrance, blooming during the rainy season, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in water absorption and stabilization.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne pedicellata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in shaded, moist environments. This species is particularly associated with the islands of Sumatra and Borneo, where it thrives in the tropical rainforests. It is also present in parts of Thailand and Vietnam, where it contributes to the understory vegetation.</p>
<p>The plant's distribution is closely linked to the biodiversity-rich regions of the Malay Archipelago.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne pedicellata was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, making it suitable for cultivation in shaded garden areas. Its introduction has sometimes led to its establishment in natural habitats, raising concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, further research is needed to fully understand its role in introduced ecosystems.</p>
