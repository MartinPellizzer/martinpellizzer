                        <h1>Acantholimon raddeanum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon raddeanum, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features wiry, branched stems covered in fine, glandular hairs, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pink. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Acantholimon raddeanum is adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, thriving in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acantholimon raddeanum belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and algae that have a complex life cycle with a dominant sporophyte stage. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses vascular plants with a diverse range of forms, including ferns and flowering plants. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants characterized by their primitive floral structures and a wide variety of growth habits.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes many species with showy flowers and often includes plants adapted to arid environments. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, a family of flowering plants known for their medicinal properties and often containing species with distinctive blue or purple flowers. Its genus is Acantholimon, a group of flowering plants commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by their succulent leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon raddeanum, a specific plant within the genus known for its adaptations to harsh environments and its role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon raddeanum is primarily native to Iran and Turkmenistan.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions within these countries. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often in mountainous or steppe-like habitats. The species is well adapted to the dry and harsh climatic conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Iran and Turkmenistan, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon raddeanum was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dune environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor conditions and is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate. This plant is typically spread by wind-dispersed seeds and can establish itself in disturbed or open habitats. It is often seen in coastal scrub and sand dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing loose soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has been introduced to several regions outside its native range for ornamental or ecological purposes.</p>
