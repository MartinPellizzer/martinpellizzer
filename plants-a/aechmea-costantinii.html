                <h1>Aechmea costantinii</h1>
<p>Aechmea costantinii, commonly known as the Costa Rican pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the humid forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of long, narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with vibrant red and orange flowers that bloom in the spring. Its foliage is often adorned with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its tropical habitat.</p>
<p>Aechmea costantinii is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea costantinii has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, spiny, and dark green with a waxy coating, arranged in a tight spiral around the central stem.</p>
<p>The stem is short and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains hidden beneath the leaves. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with striking violet or purple flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring and are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds. The fruit is a bright red, fleshy capsule that disperses seeds through animal consumption and wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in the soil, with some aerial roots that absorb moisture from the air.</p>
