                <h1>Acer campestre var. laevigatum</h1>
<p>Acer campestre var. laevigatum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved maple, is a variant of the common maple.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. The leaves are typically smooth-edged and have a distinctive palmate shape with five lobes. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. laevigatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a multi-stemmed shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, yellowish-green catkins that appear in early spring, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. laevigatum is a variant of the field maple, native to central and eastern Europe, particularly in regions of Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of western and central Europe, though it is less common today due to habitat loss. It thrives in moist, temperate environments such as woodlands, hedgerows, and stream valleys. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 200 to 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>It is considered a rare and threatened species, with a conservation status of near threatened due to habitat fragmentation and limited population size.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. laevigatum is a small, ornamental tree known for its attractive, rounded form and yellow autumn foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. This species has a slow to moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in 10 to 15 years, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering.</p>
<p>Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications in early spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. laevigatum is a versatile shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in hedgerows, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a range of ecological interactions. Its dense growth also aids in erosion control by stabilizing soil along slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem by offering habitat and food resources throughout the year.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. laevigatum is a small tree or shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia, known for its ornamental value in landscaping and garden design.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and flowers may have minor roles in traditional herbal remedies. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to ecological stability by providing habitat and soil stabilization in forested areas. Culturally, it is often appreciated for its aesthetic appeal and may hold symbolic significance in local traditions.</p>
<p>Its role in biodiversity support and ecological restoration makes it valuable for environmental conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. laevigatum has a number of popular cultivars such as 'Columnare', known for its narrow, columnar growth habit, and 'Fastigiata', which exhibits a similar upright form.</p>
<p>It also produces hybrids with other maple species, contributing to the diversity of ornamental maples in horticulture. These cultivars and hybrids are valued for their unique shapes and foliage, making them popular choices in gardens and landscapes. The horticultural importance of Acer campestre var. laevigatum lies in its adaptability and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Its use in urban settings and as a specimen tree further enhances its significance in modern horticulture.</p>
