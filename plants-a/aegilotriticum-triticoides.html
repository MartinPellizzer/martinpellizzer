                <h1>Aegilotriticum triticoides</h1>
<p>Aegilotriticum triticoides, commonly known as the wheatgrass, is a member of the Poaceae family and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth rate and high nutritional value, making it popular for use in human and animal nutrition.</p>
<p>Its seeds are often consumed raw or juiced, and the plant is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilotriticum triticoides has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 10 to 30 cm in length with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and exhibits a growth pattern that is mostly upright with a tendency to form dense clumps. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, pale green to white florets, blooming during the spring and early summer, and are primarily wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, three-angled grain enclosed in a husk, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and wing-like structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas.</p>
