                    <h1>Anemia pumilio</h1>
<p>Anemia pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf anemone, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features delicate, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, silvery down. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings.</p>
<p>Its botanical name reflects its small size and its association with the anemone genus.</p>
