                <h1>Acer obtusifolium</h1>
<p>Acer obtusifolium, commonly known as the Canadian maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Canada and the northern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its oval-shaped, dark green leaves that turn bright red in the autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds known as samaras. It typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The bark of Acer obtusifolium is smooth and grayish-brown, with a distinctive flaky texture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer obtusifolium has broadly ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 5–10 cm long, with a smooth, wavy margin and a rounded base, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are bright green in summer and turn yellow to orange in autumn. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences during late spring, pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer obtusifolium is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America, primarily found in the eastern United States and parts of southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas such as New York, Pennsylvania, and the Appalachian Mountains. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in mixed hardwood forests and along stream banks. This species typically grows at elevations ranging from 200 to 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>It is considered a species of conservation concern due to habitat loss and fragmentation, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer obtusifolium is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer obtusifolium involves a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be done in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or leaf spot, and it pairs well with other native plants in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer obtusifolium is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and supporting a diverse range of plant life. Its deep roots help with erosion control, preventing soil loss in sensitive areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer obtusifolium plays a role in improving soil quality by facilitating nutrient cycling and supporting microbial activity.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer obtusifolium is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value, often planted in gardens and parks for its attractive foliage and autumn color.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its wood has been historically used for small craft and furniture due to its fine texture. In traditional medicine, various parts of the tree have been used to treat ailments such as inflammation and skin conditions. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some regions, representing resilience and renewal.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems also supports biodiversity by providing habitat and food for wildlife.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
