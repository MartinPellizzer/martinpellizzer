                    <h1>Alisma subalatum</h1>
<p>Alisma subalatum, commonly known as the alpine water plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine meadows and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its rhizomatous root system helps it anchor in rocky soils and absorb nutrients from water.</p>
<p>Alisma subalatum is adapted to cold climates and is a characteristic species of high-altitude wetlands.</p>
