                <h1>Adhatoda tweedieana var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Adhatoda tweedieana var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf adhatoda, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is often found in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive aromatic scent and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and green spaces.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda tweedieana var. angustifolia has elongated, narrow leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and slightly woody, with a smooth, pale green bark that exhibits a slightly fibrous texture. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring five pale blue petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda tweedieana var. angustifolia is a rare medicinal plant native to the Western Ghats of India, particularly in the states of Kerala and Karnataka.</p>
<p>It is currently found in fragmented habitats across the same region, though its distribution has significantly declined. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth and rocky slopes. It typically grows at altitudes between 600 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-harvesting, it is listed as critically endangered in the IUCN Red List, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda tweedieana var. angustifolia is a rare and ornamental plant known for its delicate foliage and unique flowering.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 2-3 years, and thrives in well-draining soil with moderate watering. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and promote healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions, and it benefits from companion planting with marigolds or lavender for natural pest control.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adhatoda tweedieana var. angustifolia is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The plant acts as a companion plant in certain agricultural settings, enhancing the growth of neighboring crops. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in improving soil fertility by acting as a nitrogen fixer through its association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Adhatoda tweedieana var. angustifolia is a plant that holds various uses and applications across different domains.</p>
<p>In medicinal contexts, it is valued for its potential therapeutic properties, often used in traditional medicine to treat respiratory and digestive ailments.
