<p>Austroblechnum durum, commonly known as the Southern Shield Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Austroblechnum durum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
