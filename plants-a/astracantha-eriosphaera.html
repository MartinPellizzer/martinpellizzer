<p>Astracantha eriosphaera, commonly known as the woolly globe thorn, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering that covers its stems and leaves, providing a protective layer against moisture loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its fuzzy foliage. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
