<p>Allocasuarina campestris, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a shrub or small tree native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, spherical flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, which are followed by woody, cone-like structures containing seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and heathlands.</p>
<p>Allocasuarina campestris plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various native fauna.</p>
