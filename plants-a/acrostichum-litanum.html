                <h1>Acrostichum litanum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum litanum, commonly known as the rattlesnake plantain, is a fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to six feet in height. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a dark green color and a slightly glossy texture.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum litanum has leaves that are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and slightly hairy, with a light brown bark that peels in thin layers. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are lightweight and adapted for aerial transport.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in moist, shaded habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum litanum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. This plant thrives in humid environments with abundant moisture and partial to full sunlight. Its natural range extends from Mexico through the Caribbean islands to northern South America.</p>
<p>It is often associated with disturbed or nutrient-rich soils in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum litanum was mainly introduced to coastal areas and disturbed sites in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, riverbanks, and other moist environments where it can thrive in sandy or clay soils. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system and ability to stabilize soil. It has been introduced to several countries in the Pacific and Caribbean for its ecological and agricultural benefits.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some areas if not managed properly.</p>
