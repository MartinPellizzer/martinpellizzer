                    <h1>Astragalus maximus</h1>
<p>Astragalus maximus, commonly known as giant milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Astragalus maximus plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
