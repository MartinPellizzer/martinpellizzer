<p>Atriplex cinerea subsp.</p>
<p>incrassata, commonly known as silverleaf shadscale, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in compact clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in saline soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>The subspecies incrassata is distinguished by its broader, more robust leaves compared to the typical form of A. cinerea.</p>
