                <h1>Adenochloa nigromarginata</h1>
<p>Adenochloa nigromarginata, commonly known as black-margin grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with dark brown margins. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicles, which are often wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Adenochloa nigromarginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive leaf coloration.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenochloa nigromarginata has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and typically range from 10 to 20 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and dark brown margins.</p>
<p>The stem is short and erect, with a smooth, slightly hairy surface and a pale green color, growing from a basal cluster of leaves. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with a pale greenish-white color, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, with each seed having a feathery appendage.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenochloa nigromarginata is primarily native to DR Congo, Uganda, and Zambia.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and wetlands. The species is well adapted to the humid climate of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its natural environment.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenochloa nigromarginata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of early European colonization efforts. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited compared to other invasive species in New Zealand.</p>
