                <h1>Acrostichum curtisii</h1>
<p>Acrostichum curtisii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually green and remain evergreen throughout the year.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum curtisii has large, leathery leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pale underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement and can reach up to 1 meter in length, contributing to the plant's dense, fern-like appearance. The stem is sturdy and upright, with a smooth, dark brown bark that develops a rough texture as the plant ages. Acrostichum curtisii produces inconspicuous, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the late spring to early summer, and they are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, round drupe that contains a single seed, which is dispersed by wind or water.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum curtisii is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Jamaica, and Hispaniola.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Central America, such as Belize and Honduras. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near rivers or in tropical rainforests. It is commonly associated with disturbed soils and can thrive in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific regions, making it a regionally significant species in the Neotropics.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum curtisii was mainly introduced to areas with humid climates and disturbed soils, often as an ornamental plant or for erosion control.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in wet, shaded environments. This plant has been introduced to several parts of the world, including the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, and parts of the United States. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread into native ecosystems.</p>
