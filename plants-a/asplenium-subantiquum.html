                    <h1>Asplenium subantiquum</h1>
<p>Asplenium subantiquum, commonly known as the ancient maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that resemble those of the more common maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
