                        <h1>Acacia carbonaria</h1>
<p>Acacia carbonaria, commonly known as the black wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that function as leaves.</p>
<p>Acacia carbonaria is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia carbonaria is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, South Africa, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in savanna and shrubland ecosystems. This species is well adapted to hot, dry climates and can tolerate low rainfall conditions. It often grows in open landscapes and is sometimes found along roadsides or in degraded habitats.</p>
<p>Acacia carbonaria plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia carbonaria was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it suitable for dryland environments. This plant has been introduced to parts of Australia, Africa, and the Middle East due to its adaptability and resilience. It is often used for erosion control and as a source of timber and fuel.</p>
<p>However, its spread can sometimes lead to ecological impacts in non-native habitats.</p>
