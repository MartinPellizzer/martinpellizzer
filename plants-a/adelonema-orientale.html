                <h1>Adelonema orientale</h1>
<p>Adelonema orientale, commonly known as the Chinese bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features showy, trumpet-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Adelonema orientale is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelonema orientale has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a glossy dark green color, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a bushy pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelonema orientale is primarily native to Peru.</p>
<p>It is found in the Andean regions of the country, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas, often in regions with cool and humid climates. It is part of the Polygonaceae family and is known for its distinctive foliage.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Peru's diverse landscape.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelonema orientale was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century as an ornamental plant. The species has since spread throughout the North Island, particularly in coastal and lowland areas. It is now considered a weed in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
