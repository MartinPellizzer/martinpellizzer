                <h1>Adelonema orientale</h1>
<p>Adelonema orientale, commonly known as the oriental starflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 30-60 cm, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, are clustered in cymes and attract various pollinators.</p>
<p>Adelonema orientale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelonema orientale has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelonema orientale is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>While its original range was limited to these areas, it is now found in a few protected reserves and botanical gardens outside its native habitat due to habitat loss. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil, typically found in forest understories. The plant grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat degradation, Adelonema orientale is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adelonema orientale is a hardy, ornamental plant known for its delicate foliage and vibrant flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or division, with seed sowing being the most common method for cultivating new plants. The growth cycle of Adelonema orientale is typically perennial, with active growth during spring and early summer, followed by a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, but should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases, though occasional infestations of aphids or slugs may occur.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
