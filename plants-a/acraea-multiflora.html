                <h1>Acraea multiflora</h1>
<p>Acraea multiflora, commonly known as the African凤蝶, is a species of butterfly found in various parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nymphalidae and is characterized by its striking wing patterns. The plant it interacts with, primarily certain species of flowering plants, serves as a host for its larvae. Acraea multiflora's life cycle is closely tied to the availability of these host plants.</p>
<p>Its presence in an ecosystem can indicate the health and biodiversity of the surrounding flora.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acraea multiflora has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elliptical to ovate leaflets that are medium in size, usually ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, and have a dark green, glossy upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that has a slightly rough texture. The flowers are clustered in panicles, with small, delicate, white to pale yellow petals and a distinctive spurred structure, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees and other small insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acraea multiflora is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grassland and savanna habitats, often near water sources. The plant thrives in regions with a tropical or subtropical climate and is adapted to seasonal rainfall patterns. It is sometimes seen growing along roadsides and in open woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of its host plants, which are typically members of the Fabaceae family.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acraea multiflora was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it can thrive in open habitats such as grasslands, savannas, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is often found near human settlements and along roadsides, where it benefits from the disturbed soil and increased sunlight. The plant is known for its attractive blue and white flowers, which make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
