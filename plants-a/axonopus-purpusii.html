<p>Axonopus purpusii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf muhly, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, often forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually narrow and slightly curled at the edges. Its flowering spikes are small and clustered, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Axonopus purpusii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
