                    <h1>Angraecum boonei</h1>
<p>Angraecum boonei, commonly known as the Boone's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences bearing fragrant, white or pale blue flowers with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific nocturnal moths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Angraecum boonei is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
