<p>Aristida portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to the island of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as dry forests and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the grass family. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Aristida portoricensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
