                <h1>Adiantum macropus</h1>
<p>Adiantum macropus, commonly known as the large-veined maidenhair fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a glossy texture. The plant features small, sporangia that are clustered along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of the Adiantum genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and garden cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum macropus has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a slender, arching shape and a light green color.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender, wiry, and has a smooth, pale green bark. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spore-bearing structures called sorus, typically appearing in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The fruit is a spore capsule that disperses spores through wind, and the plant has a fibrous root system that anchors it to moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum macropus is primarily native to eastern and southeastern Australia, including parts of New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors, rock outcrops, and stream banks. This fern thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often seen in both natural and cultivated environments due to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Adiantum macropus is a hardy species that can tolerate a range of soil types but prefers acidic conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum macropus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, stream margins, and swampy areas. The plant is often associated with disturbed sites and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. It is known for its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often used in horticultural displays.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become naturalized in many parts of the country.</p>
