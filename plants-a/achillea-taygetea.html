                <h1>Achillea taygetea</h1>
<p>Achillea taygetea, commonly known as the Greek yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It features a compact, upright growth habit with basal leaves that are gray-green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sunny soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea taygetea has leaves that are lanceolate to linear, with a grayish-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a greenish-brown color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a achene, with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea taygetea is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean, specifically found in southern Greece and the island of Crete.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to these areas, where it thrives in rocky and limestone soils. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, slopes, and forest edges, often in sunny environments. This plant is found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Achillea taygetea is considered a rare species and is listed as vulnerable in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea taygetea is a hardy perennial known for its vibrant, daisy-like flowers and resilience in various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. The plant has a long growth cycle, blooming from late spring to early autumn, with a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding over-saturation. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if conditions are too damp.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea taygetea is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering food sources and habitat. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. It also contributes to erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving soil health and supporting biodiversity in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea taygetea is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, known for its ornamental value and use in gardens.</p>
