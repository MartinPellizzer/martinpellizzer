                <h1>Acrostichum album</h1>
<p>Acrostichum album, commonly known as the white fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found near water sources. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Acrostichum album is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum album has large, pinnately compound leaves that are elongated and feather-like, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and erect with a smooth, light green bark. The plant produces inconspicuous, greenish flowers that bloom in late summer, relying on wind for pollination.</p>
<p>Its fruit is a small, three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and its roots are fibrous and spread out to anchor the plant firmly in moist soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum album is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangroves, and swampy habitats. This plant thrives in humid, saline environments and is often associated with estuaries and tidal flats. Its natural range extends from the Caribbean to northern South America.</p>
<p>It is also occasionally found in the southern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum album was mainly introduced to the coastal areas of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has been documented in states such as Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. This plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in tidal wetlands. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to invade native plant communities.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete local flora.</p>
