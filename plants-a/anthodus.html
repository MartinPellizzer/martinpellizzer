                    <h1>Anthodus</h1>
<p>Anthodus, commonly known as the "sea scorpion," is an extinct genus of arthropods that lived during the Cambrian period.</p>
<p>It belongs to the class Merostomata and is characterized by its segmented body and pair of pincers. Anthodus had a robust exoskeleton composed primarily of chitin, which provided protection against predators. Its body was typically divided into a head, thorax, and abdomen, with multiple pairs of walking legs.</p>
<p>Fossils of Anthodus are often found in marine sediments, indicating it was a marine creature that thrived in ancient oceans.</p>
