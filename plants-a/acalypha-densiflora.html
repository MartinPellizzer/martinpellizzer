                        <h1>Acalypha densiflora</h1>
<p>Acalypha densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered spurflower, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, showy flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant has palmate leaves with lobed margins, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
<p>The species is also known for its ability to thrive in humid climates with well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha densiflora is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with moist, shaded environments and is sometimes found in disturbed areas. It is known for its dense foliage and small, clustered flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has also been introduced to other tropical regions outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha densiflora was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The introduction occurred in the 19th century, during a period of increased botanical exchange between Europe and the Pacific. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become a weed in certain regions, posing a threat to native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rapid spread highlights the importance of monitoring introduced species for ecological impact.</p>
