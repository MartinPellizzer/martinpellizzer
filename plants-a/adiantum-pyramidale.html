                <h1>Adiantum pyramidale</h1>
<p>Adiantum pyramidale, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a delicate evergreen fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped, bright green fronds that are divided into small, tooth-like segments. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum pyramidale is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum pyramidale has fern-like leaves that are triangular in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a delicate, lace-like appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 10â€“30 cm long, with a light green color and a smooth, waxy texture. The plant has a short, slender stem with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a cluster of dry, spore-bearing structures, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum pyramidale is primarily native to Cuba, Jamaica, Leeward Is., Puerto Rico, Venezuela, and Windward Is.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these islands. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in moist soil along stream banks or in forest understories. The plant is well adapted to the warm and wet climate of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum pyramidale was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been reported in Washington, Oregon, and northern California. This plant is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread.</p>
<p>Its introduction is believed to be through horticultural trade and accidental dispersal.</p>
