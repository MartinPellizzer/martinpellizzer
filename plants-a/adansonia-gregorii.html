                    <h1>Adansonia gregorii</h1>
<p>Adansonia gregorii, commonly known as the desert baobab, is a striking tree native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The tree produces large, white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting pollinators such as bats and insects. Its leaves are palmate, consisting of several lobes, and it produces long, woody pods containing edible seeds.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to extreme conditions, making it a symbol of resilience in the Australian outback.</p>
