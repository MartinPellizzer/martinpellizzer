                <h1>Adenostoma californicum</h1>
<p>Adenostoma californicum, commonly known as the California scrub oak, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and is often found in chaparral ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostoma californicum has small, narrow, needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally along the stem, typically ranging from 1 to 3 centimeters in length and displaying a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The flowers are small, clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to the dry, rocky soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostoma californicum is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant thrives in areas with mild, wet winters and dry summers. It is often associated with the Santa Monica Mountains and other coastal ranges.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to regions with specific climatic and soil conditions that support its growth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostoma californicum was mainly introduced to areas with dry, open habitats such as chaparral and coastal sage scrub.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of California, particularly in the southern and central parts of the state. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed or burned areas. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various ecological communities, sometimes outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature.</p>
