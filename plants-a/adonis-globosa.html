                <h1>Adonis globosa</h1>
<p>Adonis globosa, commonly known as the globeflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, globular inflorescence composed of numerous small, yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm and has basal leaves that are often woolly in texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Adonis globosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis globosa has leaves that are basal, spoon-shaped, and have a bluish-green color with a woolly texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, growing from 30 to 60 centimeters tall. The flowers are clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis globosa is primarily native to Iran.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the central and eastern parts. This plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing at higher elevations. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Iran, making it a regionally significant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis globosa was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been reported in various regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. The plant's introduction is often unintentional, spreading via seeds carried by wind, water, or animal movement. It has established populations in disturbed soils and open areas, sometimes outcompeting native flora.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it poses a potential threat to local ecosystems in non-native regions.</p>
