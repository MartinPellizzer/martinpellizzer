<p>Astragalus atropilosulus var. abyssinicus, commonly known as the Abyssinian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the highlands of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptation in high-altitude regions.</p>
