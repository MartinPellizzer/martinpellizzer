<p>Asplenium hastatum var. pterocaulon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a compact growth habit, with short, creeping rhizomes that form dense, mat-like colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for shaded, moist environments and is often used in woodland gardens.</p>
