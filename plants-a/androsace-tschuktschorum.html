<p>Androsace tschuktschorum, commonly known as the Tschuktschorum sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense cushions or mats, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, providing insulation against freezing temperatures. Its flowers are usually pink or white, arranged in clusters, and bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Androsace tschuktschorum is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and thrives in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
