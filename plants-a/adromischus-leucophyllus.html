                <h1>Adromischus leucophyllus</h1>
<p>Adromischus leucophyllus, commonly known as the silver leafed stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it an attractive addition to rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adromischus leucophyllus has succulent, fleshy leaves that are ovate to oblong in shape, arranged in a rosette pattern, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically a vibrant green with a waxy, glossy surface and often display a bluish or whitish hue on the upper surface. The stem is short and often buried beneath the soil, with a smooth, pale greenish-brown bark that is slightly rough in texture. It produces small, star-shaped flowers that are predominantly yellow with red or orange stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adromischus leucophyllus is primarily native to the Cape Provinces of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky outcrops and granite soils within this region. This succulent plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the Cape Provinces, characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific areas within the Cape Provinces, making it a regionally endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adromischus leucophyllus was mainly introduced to regions with mild, arid climates and well-draining soils, particularly in parts of South Africa and other parts of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun exposure and minimal rainfall, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens and rockeries. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value, especially its compact, rosette-shaped foliage. It is relatively low maintenance, requiring infrequent watering and minimal fertilizer.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to various parts of the world where similar climatic conditions exist.</p>
