                <h1>Acourtia joaquinensis</h1>
<p>Acourtia joaquinensis, commonly known as Joaquin's acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and gravelly soils. It produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Acourtia joaquinensis is a perennial species that is often found in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia joaquinensis has small, narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia joaquinensis is primarily native to the northeastern region of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in specific areas within this region, particularly in the states of Nuevo Le√≥n, Coahuila, and Tamaulipas. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Its distribution is limited to these particular geographic locations, making it a regionally endemic species.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, Acourtia joaquinensis is considered a rare and specialized plant within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia joaquinensis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often due to human activity such as grazing or land development.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southwestern United States, particularly in California and Nevada. This plant thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soil, making it adaptable to a variety of ecological conditions. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and anthropogenic landscapes.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native plant communities remains a subject of ongoing ecological study.</p>
