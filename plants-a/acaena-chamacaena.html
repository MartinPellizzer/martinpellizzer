<p>Acaena chamacaena, commonly known as the Chilean burr bush, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and spiny bracts. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive, spherical fruits that are covered in hooked bristles. These bristles aid in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing.</p>
<p>Acaena chamacaena is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
