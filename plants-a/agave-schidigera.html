                    <h1>Agave schidigera</h1>
<p>Agave schidigera, commonly known as the desert agave, is a perennial succulent native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces a rosette of spiky, blue-green leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It blooms once in its lifetime, producing a tall flowering stalk with yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of fibers.</p>
