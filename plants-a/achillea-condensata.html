                <h1>Achillea condensata</h1>
<p>Achillea condensata, commonly known as narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant features slender, linear leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties have been historically valued for their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea condensata has basal leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a grayish-green color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, herbaceous, and covered in fine hairs, with a light green to reddish-brown color, growing from the base of the plant. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb moisture.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea condensata is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas such as Spain, Portugal, and southern France, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. It prefers sunny environments with well-drained soil, commonly found in grasslands, scrublands, and coastal areas. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea condensata is listed as a species of concern in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea condensata is a hardy perennial plant known for its feathery foliage and showy yellow flowers, commonly used in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rhizomes or by sowing seeds in early spring. The plant has a cool-season growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogged roots. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if conditions are too damp.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or sage can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea condensata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both nectar and shelter in its dense foliage. This plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea condensata contributes to the overall biodiversity of its habitat by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea condensata is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia, known for its aromatic leaves and yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. While not widely used in culinary applications, it may be incorporated into herbal teas or infusions. In industrial contexts, its essential oils are sometimes extracted for use in perfumery or as natural pesticides.</p>
<p>Culturally, it has symbolic significance in some regions, often associated with healing and protection.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea condensata has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aurea' and 'Purpurea,' which are appreciated for their vibrant foliage and flowers. While natural hybrids are less common, some horticulturists have developed crosses to enhance traits like flower color and hardiness. These plants are important in gardens for their ability to thrive in various conditions.</p>
<p>Their horticultural significance lies in their role as drought-tolerant, low-maintenance perennials that add visual interest to landscapes.</p>
