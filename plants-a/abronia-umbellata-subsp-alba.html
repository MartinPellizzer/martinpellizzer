                        <h1>Abronia umbellata subsp. alba</h1>
<p>Abronia umbellata subsp.</p>
<p>alba, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, white to pale pink flowers in summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is often found in coastal dunes and other disturbed, open habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia umbellata subsp.</p>
<p>alba is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern California, specifically within the counties of San Diego and San Luis Obispo. This subspecies thrives in sandy soils along the shoreline, often found in dunes and other coastal habitats.</p>
<p>It is adapted to the arid and salty conditions typical of the Pacific coast. The plant is part of the evening primrose family and is known for its small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia umbellata subsp.</p>
<p>alba was mainly introduced to coastal dunes and sandy soils in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It thrives in well-drained, sandy habitats with full sun exposure.</p>
<p>This subspecies is commonly found in areas with maritime climates and moderate to high salinity. It plays a role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>Its introduction has been documented in several states including Oregon and Washington.</p>
