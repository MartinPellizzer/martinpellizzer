                    <h1>Acanthophyllum minuartioides</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum minuartioides, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial shrub with dense, compact growth that helps it survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss and are adapted to minimize exposure to intense sunlight. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Acanthophyllum minuartioides plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in habitats such as dunes and rocky slopes.</p>
