                        <h1>Acaena adscendens var. minuscula</h1>
<p>Acaena adscendens var. minuscula, commonly known as the small-flowered burr bush, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features small, spiny bracts that form dense, spherical clusters, which are characteristic of the genus Acaena. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, followed by the development of persistent, woolly burrs that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, coastal environments and is often found in coastal dunes and shrublands.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena adscendens var. minuscula is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This plant typically grows in rocky and gravelly soils, often in dry, open habitats. It is commonly seen in areas with low rainfall and is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>The species is part of the genus Acaena, which includes several other shrubs and herbs native to New Zealand.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena adscendens var. minuscula was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. This plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and has limited ecological impact.</p>
