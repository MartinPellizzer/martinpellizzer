                    <h1>Acaena adscendens var. minuscula</h1>
<p>Acaena adscendens var. minuscula, commonly known as the small-flowered burr bush, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features small, spiny bracts that form dense, spherical clusters, which are characteristic of the genus Acaena. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, followed by the development of persistent, woolly burrs that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, coastal environments and is often found in coastal dunes and shrublands.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
