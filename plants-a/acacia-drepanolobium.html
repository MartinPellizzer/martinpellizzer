<p>Acacia drepanolobium, commonly known as the silver acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow to golden yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in drought conditions. Its bark and thorns are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a vital role in soil stabilization and habitat provision.</p>
<p>The species is also known for its association with certain ant species, which live in the hollow thorns and protect the plant from herbivores.</p>
