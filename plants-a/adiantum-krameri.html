                <h1>Adiantum krameri</h1>
<p>Adiantum krameri, commonly known as the Mexican maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its leaves are bipinnate, with fine, hair-like segments that give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Adiantum krameri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and thrives in humid conditions with well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum krameri has feather-like, finely divided leaves that are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a light green to dark green color, and they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and somewhat fibrous, with a pale green to reddish-brown color, and it grows in a clumping manner. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum krameri is primarily native to French Guiana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the rainforests and moist environments of this region. This fern thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and abundant rainfall. It is often seen growing on rocks or in shaded areas within the dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to the specific ecological conditions of French Guiana.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum krameri was mainly introduced to the eastern United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, delicate fronds.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several states, particularly in moist, shaded environments. The plant is commonly found in disturbed areas, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it remains popular in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
