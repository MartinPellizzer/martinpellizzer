<p>Arenaria ciliata subsp.</p>
<p>pseudofrigida, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates.</p>
<p>The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in high-altitude meadows and is a characteristic component of alpine flora.</p>
