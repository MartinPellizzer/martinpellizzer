                <h1>Acianthera kateora</h1>
<p>Acianthera kateora, commonly known as the Kateora orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate floral structure and vibrant coloration. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small but numerous, often displaying a mix of white, purple, and pink hues.</p>
<p>Acianthera kateora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera kateora has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring pale purple petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera kateora is primarily native to Colombia.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the Andean foothills and lowland rainforests. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within Colombia's diverse ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is a rare and endemic species, contributing to the country's rich biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera kateora was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often colonizing disturbed areas and forest edges. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, careful monitoring is needed to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
