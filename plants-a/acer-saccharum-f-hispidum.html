                        <h1>Acer saccharum f. hispidum</h1>
<p>Acer saccharum f. hispidum, commonly known as the hairy sugar maple, is a variant of the sugar maple tree characterized by its distinctive hairy or pubescent leaves.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a more rugged appearance compared to the typical smooth-leaved sugar maple, with leaves that are often more serrated and covered in fine hairs. It is native to eastern North America, particularly in regions with moist, well-drained soils. The tree produces small, red samaras that disperse its seeds, contributing to its natural range.</p>
<p>While less commonly cultivated than the standard sugar maple, it is appreciated for its unique foliage and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
