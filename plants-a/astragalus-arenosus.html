                    <h1>Astragalus arenosus</h1>
<p>Astragalus arenosus, commonly known as sand milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert environments. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Astragalus arenosus plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
