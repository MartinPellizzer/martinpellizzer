                <h1>Acianthera caldensis</h1>
<p>Acianthera caldensis, commonly known as the Calden's orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has slender, upright stems and is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. Its leaves are elongated and often clustered at the base, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Acianthera caldensis is valued in horticulture for its beauty and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera caldensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in inflorescences, displaying a striking pink to purple color, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by moths and small flies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera caldensis is primarily native to Brazil South and Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans across these regions. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soil. The plant is typically found in shaded understory areas of forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera caldensis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in Hawaii in the early 2000s. The plant likely arrived through human activity, such as accidental transport via soil or plant material. It has since spread to other tropical regions with suitable climates.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is now monitored in several countries.</p>
