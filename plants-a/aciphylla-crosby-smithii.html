                <h1>Aciphylla crosby-smithii</h1>
<p>Aciphylla crosby-smithii, commonly known as the Crosby-Smith's silvergrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny white flowers. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in coastal and alpine regions.</p>
<p>Aciphylla crosby-smithii is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is an important component of New Zealand's native flora.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciphylla crosby-smithii has leaves that are needle-like, linear, and arranged in a rosette pattern, with a bluish-gray color and a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively hidden beneath the dense foliage. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale blue petals and a tubular shape, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind after splitting open.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, anchoring the plant in rocky soils and helping it access groundwater.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla crosby-smithii is primarily native to New Zealand South.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of New Zealand, particularly in the South Island. This plant typically grows in dry, exposed areas such as coastal dunes and rocky habitats. It is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific locations within New Zealand's southern ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla crosby-smithii was mainly introduced to South Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the state. This plant is typically associated with sandy or gravelly soils. It is often seen in open habitats such as plains and dunes.</p>
<p>The distribution of this species is limited to specific areas within the Flinders Ranges and the lower Eyre Peninsula.</p>
