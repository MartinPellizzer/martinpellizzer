<p>Angostura candolleana, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Angostura candolleana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine setting.</p>
