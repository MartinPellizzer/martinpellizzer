                <h1>Adenostylis merrillii</h1>
<p>Adenostylis merrillii, commonly known as the Hawaiian false dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostylis merrillii has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a rough, dark brown bark that forms a compact, low-growing plant. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and a greenish-yellow center, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases small, winged seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's arid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostylis merrillii is primarily native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is found in specific regions of the islands, particularly in the wetter, more mesic habitats. This plant is commonly associated with coastal and lowland areas, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It thrives in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures.</p>
<p>Adenostylis merrillii is an important component of the native flora in these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostylis merrillii was mainly introduced to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It was brought there by humans, likely as part of ornamental or horticultural efforts. This plant has since become naturalized in certain areas of the islands. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems.</p>
