                    <h1>Arenaria capillaris var. glandulosa</h1>
<p>Arenaria capillaris var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Its glandular structures on the leaves and stems contribute to its ability to survive in cold, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
