                    <h1>Acrodon caespitosus</h1>
<p>Acrodon caespitosus, commonly known as the hairy broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense spikes. It is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, often parasitizing grasses and shrubs.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical studies.</p>
