                    <h1>Acer villosum</h1>
<p>Acer villosum, commonly known as the silky maple, is a deciduous tree native to the northern United States and southern Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely hairy leaves, which give it a soft, silvery appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that are distinctive for their elongated, winged seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more fissured with age.</p>
<p>Acer villosum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
