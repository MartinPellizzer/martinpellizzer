<p>Aphelandra leiophylla, commonly known as the silver-leaf torchflower, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a silvery, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, orange-yellow bracts that resemble torches, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Aphelandra leiophylla is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities.</p>
