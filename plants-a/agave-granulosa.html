                    <h1>Agave granulosa</h1>
<p>Agave granulosa, commonly known as the granulate agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color with a granular texture. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that bears small, white flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Agave granulosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
