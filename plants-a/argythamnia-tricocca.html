                <h1>Argythamnia tricocca</h1>
<p>Argythamnia tricocca, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss and provide some protection against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Argythamnia tricocca is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats.</p>
