<p>Asplenium boryanum, commonly known as the Boryan maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green with a bluish tint. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spores are dispersed through small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium boryanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
