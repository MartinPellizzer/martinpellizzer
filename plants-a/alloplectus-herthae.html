                    <h1>Alloplectus herthae</h1>
<p>Alloplectus herthae, commonly known as the Herth's cypress, is a rare and unique coniferous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and a compact, shrub-like growth form. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Alloplectus herthae thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous forest areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
