                    <h1>Aspidopterys costulata</h1>
<p>Aspidopterys costulata, commonly known as the clustered fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often grow in clusters. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in rainforests and humid woodlands. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Aspidopterys costulata is valued not only for its ornamental appearance but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
