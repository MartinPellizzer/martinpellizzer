                <h1>Achillea tomentoides</h1>
<p>Achillea tomentoides, commonly known as cloudless yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features a compact, bushy growth habit with silvery-gray, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces flat, composite flower heads in shades of white to pale yellow, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are aromatic and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its tactile appeal.</p>
<p>Achillea tomentoides is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea tomentoides has leaves that are basal, forming a rosette, with spoon-shaped (spathulate) blades that are grayish-white due to dense, woolly hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and slightly reddish, with a growth pattern that is erect and branching. The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters (corymbs), blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, with small, hooked bristles that aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
