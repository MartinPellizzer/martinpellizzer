                        <h1>Acantholimon tarbagataicum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon tarbagataicum, commonly known as the Tarbagatai thorned sedge, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia, particularly Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Plumbaginaceae and is characterized by its erect, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
