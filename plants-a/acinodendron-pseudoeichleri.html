                <h1>Acinodendron pseudoeichleri</h1>
<p>Acinodendron pseudoeichleri, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its strength and fine grain. The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and has compound leaves with opposite arrangement. It produces small, white or pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron pseudoeichleri has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are glossy green in color and measure approximately 2-4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is grayish-brown in color, and it grows as an upright shrub with a dense branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron pseudoeichleri is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, specifically Thailand and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forests, where it thrives in humid and warm climates. This plant is often associated with secondary growth areas and is typically found in the understory of dense forests. It prefers well-drained soils and is not commonly seen in open areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its distribution has become more restricted in recent years.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron pseudoeichleri was mainly introduced to new habitats in Southeast Asia, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and degraded forests. This plant has shown adaptability to various soil types and climatic conditions, contributing to its spread. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become an invasive species in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Monitoring its distribution is essential to assess its ecological impact.</p>
