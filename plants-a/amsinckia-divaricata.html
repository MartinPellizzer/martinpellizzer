<p>Amsinckia divaricata, commonly known as the desert tarplant, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Amsinckia divaricata is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
