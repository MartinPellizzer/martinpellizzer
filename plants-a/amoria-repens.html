<p>Amoria repens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, sprawling stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine pubescence.</p>
<p>Amoria repens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks.</p>
