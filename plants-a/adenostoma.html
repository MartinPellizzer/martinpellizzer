<p>Adenostoma, commonly known as the coastal buckthorn, is a genus of flowering plants native to California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, including Adenostoma fasciculatum and Adenostoma cuneatum, which are shrubs adapted to coastal and chaparral environments. These plants are characterized by their small, clustered leaves and yellow or white flowers that bloom in the spring.

<p>Adenostoma species are also valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
