<p>Aylostera orurensis, commonly known as the golden sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are succulent and adapted to store water, which helps it survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Aylostera orurensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
