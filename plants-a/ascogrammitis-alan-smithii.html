<p>Ascogrammitis alan-smithii, commonly known as the Alan-Smith's water fern, is a rare and delicate aquatic fern native to specific regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in shaded, nutrient-rich habitats. Its small, spore-producing structures are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
