                <h1>Achillea thomasiana</h1>
<p>Achillea thomasiana, commonly known as Thomas's yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. It is often found in alpine environments, where it adapts to cold and arid conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a distinctive and hardy species within its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea thomasiana has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a grayish-green color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a reddish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly woody, growing in a clumping pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming in late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea thomasiana is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, specifically found in countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of northern India.</p>
<p>While its original range was limited, it is now cultivated in botanical gardens and horticultural collections around the world. This species thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and prefers sunny, open habitats such as alpine meadows and slopes. It is typically found at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, Achillea thomasiana is considered to be of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea thomasiana is a hardy perennial plant known for its fluffy, yellow flowers and aromatic foliage, commonly grown in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rhizomes or by sowing seeds in early spring. The plant has a dormant growth cycle, with active growth in spring and flowering in summer, followed by a period of rest in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot in poorly drained conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's biodiversity.</p>
