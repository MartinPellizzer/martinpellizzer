                <h1>Achillea thomasiana</h1>
<p>Achillea thomasiana, commonly known as Thomas's yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is known for its aromatic, feathery leaves. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to white, and it blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Thomas's yarrow is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea thomasiana has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a silver-gray underside and a dark green upper surface, arranged in a rosette pattern and typically measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. The flowers are small, composite yellow blooms arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus, facilitating wind dispersal, and the seeds are small and numerous.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea thomasiana is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, including the Santa Barbara and San Francisco Bay regions. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with open habitats such as dunes, chaparral, and coastal scrub. It is known for its showy yellow flowers and is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is often protected by local conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea thomasiana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been reported in Washington and Oregon, where it has established itself in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open fields. The plant is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It spreads primarily through seeds dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
