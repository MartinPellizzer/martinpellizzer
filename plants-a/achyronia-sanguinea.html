                <h1>Achyronia sanguinea</h1>
<p>Achyronia sanguinea, commonly known as the red mallow, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, showy red or pink flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture.</p>
<p>Achyronia sanguinea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia sanguinea has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate in shape, dark green in color, and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when it bursts open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia sanguinea is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. It is often associated with disturbed or secondary growth areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is also occasionally reported in parts of the Caribbean islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia sanguinea was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats like roadsides, wastelands, and agricultural areas. The plant has adapted well to a variety of soil types and climatic conditions, allowing it to spread rapidly. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in some regions.</p>
<p>However, it is not currently classified as a major invasive species in most areas.</p>
