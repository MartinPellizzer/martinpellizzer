<p>Alnus februaria var. quercifolia, commonly known as the black alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, alternate leaves that resemble those of oak, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in forest ecosystems.</p>
