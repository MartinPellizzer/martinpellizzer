                    <h1>Aquilaria banaense</h1>
<p>Aquilaria banaense, commonly known as the Bornean agarwood tree, is a member of the Thymelaeaceae family and is native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic resinous heartwood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant produces a unique type of resin called gaharu, which is formed in response to fungal infections or injuries. Aquilaria banaense typically grows as a tall evergreen tree, reaching heights of up to 30 meters.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its natural range.</p>
