                    <h1>Allium cepa f. viviparum</h1>
<p>Allium cepa f. viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous onion, is a botanical variant of the common onion characterized by its unique reproductive method.</p>
<p>Unlike typical onions, this form produces bulbils along its stem, which can develop into new plants without the need for seeds. These bulbils are small, rounded structures that resemble miniature onions and are often referred to as "baby onions.". The plant typically grows in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its viviparous trait makes it an interesting subject for botanical study and propagation.</p>
