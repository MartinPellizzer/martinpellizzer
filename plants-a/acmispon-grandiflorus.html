                <h1>Acmispon grandiflorus</h1>
<p>Acmispon grandiflorus, commonly known as the largeflower burro's tail, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Acmispon grandiflorus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmispon grandiflorus has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a moderate size and a dark green, glossy upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light green to brownish color, growing upright and branching freely. The flowers are pea-like, consisting of a banner, wings, and a keel, with a vibrant purple to pink color, blooming in spring, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb water and nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon grandiflorus is primarily native to California, Mexican Pacific Is., Mexico Northwest, Oregon, and Washington.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in coastal and inland regions across these areas. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, dunes, and disturbed soils. The species is well-adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its preference for well-drained soils and moderate to coastal climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon grandiflorus was mainly introduced to restore degraded lands and improve soil stability in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. The plant's deep root system helps prevent soil erosion and enhances water infiltration. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, which improve soil fertility over time.</p>
<p>Its introduction has supported ecological rehabilitation efforts in several regions across the southwestern United States.</p>
