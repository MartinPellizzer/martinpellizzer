<p>Armeriastrum cabulicum, commonly known as the Kashmir sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems covered in fine, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
