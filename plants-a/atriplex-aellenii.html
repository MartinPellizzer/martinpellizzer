                    <h1>Atriplex aellenii</h1>
<p>Atriplex aellenii, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in saline soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Atriplex aellenii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
