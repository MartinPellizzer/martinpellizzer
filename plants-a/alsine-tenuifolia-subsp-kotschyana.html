<p>Alsine tenuifolia subsp.</p>
<p>kotschyana, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandgrass, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale green to yellow flowers in clusters, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
