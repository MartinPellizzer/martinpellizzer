<p>Anarrhinum longipedicellatum, commonly known as the long-pedicellate grass, is a species of flowering plant in the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that are typically green or pale in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is relatively uncommon and may be of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
