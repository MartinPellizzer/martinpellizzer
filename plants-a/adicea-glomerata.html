                <h1>Adicea glomerata</h1>
<p>Adicea glomerata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 30â€“60 cm, featuring upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly serrated, often growing in opposite pairs along the stem.</p>
<p>Adicea glomerata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea glomerata has leaves that are alternate, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown color, growing upright with a somewhat branching pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are pink to reddish in color, with five petals and stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea glomerata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open woodlands, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and receives ample sunlight. It is often used in traditional medicine for its various health benefits.</p>
<p>Adicea glomerata is also occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea glomerata was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments where it can thrive in nutrient-rich conditions. This plant has shown a tendency to spread rapidly in areas with high moisture and partial shade. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to prevent its unchecked spread in native ecosystems.</p>
