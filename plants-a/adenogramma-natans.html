                <h1>Adenogramma natans</h1>
<p>Adenogramma natans, commonly known as floating bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. The plant is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family, which includes carnivorous plants. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenogramma natans has floating, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 1-2 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and flexible, with a smooth, light green bark that grows along the water surface. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and lack petals, blooming during the wet season and likely relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are adventitious, anchoring the plant to floating objects or submerged substrates.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogramma natans is primarily native to the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>It is a species that occurs in the coastal and inland regions of this area. The plant is typically found in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. It is adapted to the warm, temperate climate of the region.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within the Cape Provinces.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogramma natans was mainly introduced to aquatic and wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats. This plant is often used in water gardens and pond ecosystems. Its introduction has been associated with ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed.</p>
