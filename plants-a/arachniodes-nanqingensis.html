<p>Arachniodes nanqingensis, commonly known as the Nanqing fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive silvery underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
