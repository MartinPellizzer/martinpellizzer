                <h1>Acleia belbeysia</h1>
<p>Acleia belbeysia, commonly known as the Belbeys' blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the British Isles.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in damp, grassy areas and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves. It is a short-lived perennial that blooms from June to August.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is considered a protected species in the UK.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acleia belbeysia has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically light green with a slightly serrated margin and a smooth upper surface. The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a greyish-brown bark that is smooth when young and becomes slightly fissured with age. The flowers are clustered in racemes, featuring pale yellow to cream petals and a tubular corolla, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acleia belbeysia is primarily native to the eastern Mediterranean region, including parts of Turkey, Cyprus, and southern Greece.</p>
<p>It is also found in some areas of Syria and Lebanon. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is commonly found in scrublands and along coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acleia belbeysia was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in the region, spreading rapidly in natural and agricultural areas. The plant outcompetes native vegetation, leading to a decline in biodiversity. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is particularly problematic in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Control measures are often necessary to prevent its further spread.</p>
