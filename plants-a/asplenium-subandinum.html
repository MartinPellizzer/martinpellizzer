<p>Asplenium subandinum, commonly known as the Andean spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or forested areas, often in shaded environments where it can thrive on moist, well-drained soils. The plant features a compact rosette of dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white trichomes. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium subandinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant due to its hardy nature and aesthetic qualities.</p>
