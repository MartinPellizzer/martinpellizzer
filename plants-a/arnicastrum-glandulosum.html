                    <h1>Arnicastrum glandulosum</h1>
<p>Arnicastrum glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky arnica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky secretions. The plant produces clusters of yellow to orange flowers in the summer, which are typical of the sunflower family (Asteraceae). Its unique botanical features, including the sticky glands and robust growth form, help it thrive in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Arnicastrum glandulosum is also noted for its medicinal properties, though it is generally considered toxic when ingested.</p>
