                <h1>Adelia spinosa</h1>
<p>Adelia spinosa, commonly known as the spiny adelia, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spine-like thorns, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and grey-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Adelia spinosa is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia spinosa has leaves that are ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and measure approximately 5-8 cm in length, with a deep green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>Its stem is woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin flakes, and it grows in a sprawling, shrub-like pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia spinosa is primarily native to the semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found in shrubland and savanna habitats. This plant is well adapted to the dry climate and can survive with minimal water. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of well-drained soils and moderate to high sunlight exposure.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia spinosa was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. This plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in degraded landscapes. Its adaptability allows it to spread quickly, sometimes becoming invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is commonly used in restoration projects in regions with limited water availability.</p>
