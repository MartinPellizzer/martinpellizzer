                    <h1>Agophyllum</h1>
<p>Agophyllum, commonly known as the coastal horse-tail, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, prostrate growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spike-like structures, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. Its roots form a dense mat that helps stabilize sandy soils along the coastline.</p>
<p>Agophyllum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
