<p>Acrostichum lonchophorum, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large fern species native to tropical regions of the Pacific.</p>
<p>It features a tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing shelter and food for various wildlife.</p>
