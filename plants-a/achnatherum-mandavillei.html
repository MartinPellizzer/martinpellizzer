                <h1>Achnatherum mandavillei</h1>
<p>Achnatherum mandavillei, commonly known as Mandaville's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, hairless stems that are often丛生, forming dense tufts. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and linear, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum mandavillei has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a pale green to bluish-gray color.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, smooth, and somewhat rigid, with a light green to brownish hue, growing upright and often branching at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with greenish or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, with the seeds being light and having a slight appendage for aid in dispersal.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and rhizomatous, helping it anchor in dry, rocky soils and allowing for vegetative propagation.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum mandavillei is primarily native to Oman.</p>
<p>It is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions within the country. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open habitats. It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Oman.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum mandavillei was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and agricultural lands.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with temperate climates and moderate precipitation. This plant is commonly found in the western United States, particularly in states like California, Nevada, and Utah. Its introduction has led to its establishment in native grasslands and shrublands.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain environments.</p>
