                <h1>Acronema nervosum</h1>
<p>Acronema nervosum, commonly known as the narrow-veined acronema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped with prominent, parallel veins, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Acronema nervosum is often found in temperate regions of Asia, particularly in China and Japan.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronema nervosum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a bluish-green color, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is upright and branching. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema nervosum is primarily native to Assam, China South-Central, East Himalaya, Nepal, and Tibet.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with forested habitats. The species is known for its delicate foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the higher elevations of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema nervosum was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly seen in regions with mild winters and warm summers, such as parts of Europe and North America. This plant thrives in environments where it can receive full sun to partial shade. Its introduction has been largely due to human activities, including landscaping and gardening.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is established.</p>
