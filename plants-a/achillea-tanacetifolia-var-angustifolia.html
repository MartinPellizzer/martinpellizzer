                <h1>Achillea tanacetifolia var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Achillea tanacetifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, grass-like leaves that are narrow and linear, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped umbels. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its aromatic foliage and long blooming period make it both ornamental and useful in traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea tanacetifolia var. angustifolia has narrow, linear leaves that are typically 2â€“6 cm long, arranged in a basal rosette, and have a silver-gray underside with a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and slightly woody at the base, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, clustered in flat-topped inflorescences, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene enclosed in a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea tanacetifolia var. angustifolia is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean area, including parts of Spain, Italy, and Greece.</p>
<p>While its native range is primarily in these regions, it is now found in various parts of the world where it is cultivated or has been introduced, often as an ornamental plant. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, or gravelly soils and is commonly found in open habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea tanacetifolia var. angustifolia is a low-growing, ornamental perennial known for its finely divided, fern-like foliage and delicate white flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late winter. The plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in spring and early summer, with a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its compact form. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea tanacetifolia var. angustifolia is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its abundant yellow flowers, supporting biodiversity in local ecosystems. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its aromatic properties. It also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system, which stabilizes soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and supporting a wide range of wildlife.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
