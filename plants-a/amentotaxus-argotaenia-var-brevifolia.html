                    <h1>Amentotaxus argotaenia var. brevifolia</h1>
<p>Amentotaxus argotaenia var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved yew, is a rare and endangered coniferous species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, evergreen foliage and conical shape, with small, scale-like leaves arranged spirally along its branches. The plant produces male and female cones on separate trees, a feature typical of gymnosperms. Its seeds are encased in a fleshy, red aril, which is an adaptation for animal dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
