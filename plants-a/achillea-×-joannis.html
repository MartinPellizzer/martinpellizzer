                <h1>Achillea × joannis</h1>
<p>Achillea × joannis, commonly known as the hybrid yarrow, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Achillea millefolium (common yarrow) and Achillea ptarmica (sneezeweed). The plant typically produces flat, composite flower heads that are pink to reddish in color, often with a central disk of yellow flowers. It has finely divided, gray-green leaves and is often used in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to many landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × joannis has basal leaves that are lanceolate, serrated, and arranged in a rosette, with a dark green color and hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from early summer to late summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × joannis is a hybrid perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, specifically found in parts of southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to various parts of the world, including North America and Australia, where it is cultivated for its ornamental value. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. It typically occurs at elevations ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its spread in non-native areas can sometimes lead to ecological concerns due to its potential invasiveness.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea × joannis is a hardy perennial plant known for its bright, daisy-like flowers and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that begins with spring growth, flowering in late summer, and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune spent flowers to encourage continuous blooming. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot in poorly drained soil.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
