<p>Amphitecna gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's spurge, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that are often hidden within a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
