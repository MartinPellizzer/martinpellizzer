                        <h1>Abelicea aquatica</h1>
<p>Abelicea aquatica, commonly known as the water abelicea, is a rare aquatic plant found in freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It possesses delicate, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface, aiding in photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, allowing it to thrive in shallow, still waters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelicea aquatica is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy and rocky shorelines along the Atlantic coast. This plant is commonly found in estuarine and intertidal zones where it can tolerate fluctuating salinity levels. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small marine organisms.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelicea aquatica was mainly introduced to coastal regions with brackish water environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas where freshwater and saltwater mix, such as estuaries and mangrove swamps. The plant's introduction has been linked to human activities like aquaculture and coastal development. It has spread rapidly due to its adaptability and ability to tolerate varying salinity levels.</p>
<p>However, its presence has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
