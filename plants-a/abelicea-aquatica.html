<p>Abelicea aquatica, commonly known as the water abelicea, is a rare aquatic plant found in freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It possesses delicate, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface, aiding in photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, allowing it to thrive in shallow, still waters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
