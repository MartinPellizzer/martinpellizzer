                    <h1>Asplenium × murbeckii</h1>
<p>Asplenium × murbeckii, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium ruta-muraria.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a feature common to many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it does not produce viable seeds.</p>
