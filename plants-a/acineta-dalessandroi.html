                <h1>Acineta dalessandroi</h1>
<p>Acineta dalessandroi, commonly known as the Brazilian star-of-Bahia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous perennial with delicate, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and features hairy stems and leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to the humid tropical climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acineta dalessandroi has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and creeping, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains thin throughout the plant's growth. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acineta dalessandroi is primarily native to the arid regions of northern Brazil, particularly in the states of Amazonas and Pará.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in dry, rocky soils and is often associated with xerophytic vegetation. It thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures, typical of the Brazilian Cerrado and adjacent savanna regions. The plant is well adapted to withstand drought conditions and has developed specialized structures to conserve water.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, Acineta dalessandroi is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acineta dalessandroi was mainly introduced to the island of São Miguel in the Azores.</p>
<p>It is believed to have been brought there by human activity, possibly through accidental transport or intentional introduction for ornamental purposes. The plant has since established itself in the local ecosystem, thriving in the humid and subtropical conditions of the island. However, its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to outcompete native flora.</p>
<p>Despite its introduction, it is not yet classified as an invasive species in the region.</p>
