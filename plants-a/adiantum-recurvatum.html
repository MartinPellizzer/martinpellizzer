                <h1>Adiantum recurvatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum recurvatum, commonly known as the northern maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble羽毛. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive recurved (bent backward) appearance on the lower fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum recurvatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum recurvatum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, arranged in a feathered pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically slender, ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters in length, and have a pale green to bluish-green color. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale brown bark that grows in a clumping or creeping pattern.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, globose capsule that releases tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and establish new growth.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum recurvatum is primarily native to the eastern United States, including parts of the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. This fern thrives in humid climates and is often seen along stream banks and in woodland clearings. Its native range extends from New York to Florida and westward to Texas.</p>
<p>It is a hardy species that prefers well-drained soils and partial to full shade.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum recurvatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and stream banks. This plant is often associated with riparian zones and can thrive in areas with high humidity. It has become a popular ornamental species due to its delicate, fern-like foliage.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
