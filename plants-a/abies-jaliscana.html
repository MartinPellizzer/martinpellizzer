<p>Abies jaliscana, commonly known as the Jalisco fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the high-altitude regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces cones that are typically 5â€“8 centimeters long, containing winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
