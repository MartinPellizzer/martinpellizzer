                <h1>Acineta beyrodtiana</h1>
<p>Acineta beyrodtiana, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a small shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in winter, adding ornamental value to its appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Acineta beyrodtiana is often used in rock gardens and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acineta beyrodtiana has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, winged seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acineta beyrodtiana is primarily native to the western region of South Africa, specifically the coastal areas of the Western Cape Province.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats, often growing in the dune systems along the Atlantic coast. This plant is adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native environment, with a preference for well-drained soils. It is a small, mat-forming succulent that thrives in the unique microclimates of the coastal fynbos biome.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acineta beyrodtiana was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, particularly in the North Island. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen growing in dunes or along the shoreline. It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has become an important part of the local coastal vegetation.</p>
