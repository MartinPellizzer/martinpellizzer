<p>Abies veitchii var. reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed fir, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Veitch fir.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, reflexed (curled backward) foliage, which gives it a striking appearance. Native to the mountainous regions of central China, this plant thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil. Its conical shape and dense, dark green needles make it a valuable ornamental plant in horticulture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
