                    <h1>Arabidopsis pinnatifida</h1>
<p>Arabidopsis pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leafed thale cress, is a small flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known species like Arabidopsis thaliana. This plant is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic simplicity and rapid life cycle, it is sometimes used in botanical studies, though it is less commonly studied than its relative Arabidopsis thaliana.</p>
