                    <h1>Acmispon argophyllus var. ornithopus</h1>
<p>Acmispon argophyllus var. ornithopus, commonly known as the silverleaf burr medic, is a perennial forage plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine hairs, and its distinctive, spiny seed pods. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well-suited for dryland agriculture and erosion control. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to poor soils and drought conditions makes it a valuable species for sustainable land management.</p>
