                <h1>Achillea palmeri</h1>
<p>Achillea palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads and feathery leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a hardy and drought-tolerant species often used in xeriscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea palmeri has basal leaves that are gray-green in color, lance-shaped, and arranged in a rosette, with a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and covered with fine hairs, rising from the base and branching sparingly. The flowers are yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called cymes, and bloom from late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in dry, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea palmeri is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, including parts of California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and New Mexico. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen in desert environments. It is particularly associated with areas along the Colorado River and the Mojave Desert.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into Baja California and Sonora in Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea palmeri was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, open woodlands, and dry grasslands. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its introduction is primarily due to human activities, including landscaping and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and has limited ecological impact in its introduced range.</p>
