                <h1>Achillea helvetica</h1>
<p>Achillea helvetica, commonly known as Swiss yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat-topped clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has feathery, aromatic leaves and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils. It is known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically for its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities.</p>
<p>Achillea helvetica typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm and blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea helvetica has compound, serrated leaves that are gray-green in color, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5–15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark, growing in a clumping pattern. The flowers are yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, and bloom from late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea helvetica is a flowering plant native to the Alps, primarily found in Switzerland, France, and Italy.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of central and southern Europe, though it is less common outside its native range. It thrives in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea helvetica is a hardy perennial plant known for its showy yellow flowers and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The growth cycle begins with spring growth, followed by summer flowering, and it enters dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its vigor. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or yarrow can enhance its growth and attract beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea helvetica is a perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts beneficial insects and wildlife, contributing to biodiversity in its ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved soil conditions. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its deep root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers shelter and habitat for small invertebrates and birds.</p>
