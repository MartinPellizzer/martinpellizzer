                <h1>Achyranthes hispida</h1>
<p>Achyranthes hispida, commonly known as the hairy spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branched stems covered in fine, stiff hairs. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes hispida has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy, with a dull green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and slightly woody, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes, blooming in summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes hispida is primarily native to South Asia, including countries such as India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly found in forests, shrublands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its native range extends to some areas of Africa, particularly in eastern and southern regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes hispida was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in Brazil, Argentina, and other parts of the continent where it thrives in disturbed soils and along roadsides. This plant has been reported in various ecological studies as an invasive species in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a challenge for local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is also used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
