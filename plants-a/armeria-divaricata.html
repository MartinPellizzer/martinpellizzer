                    <h1>Armeria divaricata</h1>
<p>Armeria divaricata, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of bright pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its salty, windy habitat. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to stabilize sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Armeria divaricata is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
