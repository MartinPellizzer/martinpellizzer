                <h1>Acnistus bornmuelleri</h1>
<p>Acnistus bornmuelleri, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and alternate, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom in spring. It has a milky sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation, a characteristic shared with other members of the Apocynaceae family.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus bornmuelleri has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, somewhat hairy, and exhibit a reddish-brown color, growing in a trailing or creeping pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with five white petals and a yellow center, blooming in spring and being pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in the plant's ability to thrive in disturbed or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus bornmuelleri is primarily native to the island of Mauritius.</p>
<p>It is found in the wet and moist habitats of the island, particularly in coastal areas and forest margins. This species is adapted to the tropical climate of Mauritius and thrives in regions with high humidity and moderate rainfall. It is often seen growing in shaded undergrowth or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus bornmuelleri was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, fern-like foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and landscapes, particularly in regions with mild climates. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has the potential to become invasive in certain environments if not properly managed. The plant is native to South Africa but has been introduced to various parts of the world, including the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and rhizomes make it a concern for local ecosystems.</p>
