                    <h1>Asplenium × mantoniae</h1>
<p>Asplenium × mantoniae, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>As a hybrid, it exhibits a mix of traits from both parent species, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
