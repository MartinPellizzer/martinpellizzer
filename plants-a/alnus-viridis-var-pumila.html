                    <h1>Alnus viridis var. pumila</h1>
<p>Alnus viridis var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with slender, spreading branches and small, oval leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or wetlands.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and improve nutrient content in poor soils through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
