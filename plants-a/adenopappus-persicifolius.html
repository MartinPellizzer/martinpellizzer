                <h1>Adenopappus persicifolius</h1>
<p>Adenopappus persicifolius, commonly known as the Persian thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some areas, it is considered a weed in certain parts of the world.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenopappus persicifolius has compound leaves that are pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are arranged alternately along the stem, and they are typically green in color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough texture and a light green to reddish-brown bark, and it grows in a branching pattern. The flowers are small and clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a feathery pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopappus persicifolius is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and parts of Sonora and Sinaloa. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils in desert and semi-desert environments. It is often associated with scrubland and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones where it can thrive in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopappus persicifolius was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the western regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in California, Oregon, and Washington. This plant was introduced as an ornamental species due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its spread is a concern for local ecosystems and land managers.</p>
