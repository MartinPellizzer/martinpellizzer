                    <h1>Agathaea serrata</h1>
<p>Agathaea serrata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing flattened seeds. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of sandalwood oil.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species.</p>
