                <h1>Adenophora sublata</h1>
<p>Adenophora sublata, commonly known as the white bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched.</p>
<p>Adenophora sublata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora sublata has lance-shaped, opposite leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, upright, and slightly hairy, with a light green bark that remains smooth throughout growth. Its flowers are bell-shaped, arranged in clusters, and have a pale blue to purple color, blooming in late summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora sublata is primarily native to the regions of Chita, Khabarovsk, and Primorye in Russia.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in these areas, where it thrives in its natural habitat. It is typically associated with moist, temperate climates and is often seen in forested or semi-shaded environments. The distribution of Adenophora sublata is closely linked to the geographical and climatic conditions of these regions.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is a characteristic species of the area.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora sublata was mainly introduced to new environments through horticultural trade and intentional planting by gardeners and landscapers.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates, including parts of North America and Europe. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings. Due to its ornamental value, it has been spread beyond its native range in Asia.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts on local flora.</p>
