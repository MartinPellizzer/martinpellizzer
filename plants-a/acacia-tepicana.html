Acacia tepicana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and forage.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia tepicana is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Sonora and Baja California. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often associated with desert scrub and chaparral habitats. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife.</p>
<p>Acacia tepicana is well adapted to high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia tepicana was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant has been introduced to several parts of the world, including Australia and the southwestern United States. Its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing capabilities make it valuable for ecological restoration efforts.</p>
