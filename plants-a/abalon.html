                    <h1>Abalon</h1>
<p>Abalon, commonly known as the abalone, is a type of sea snail belonging to the family Haliotidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ear-shaped shell and a muscular foot used for attaching to surfaces. The mantle of the abalone secretes a layer of nacre, which forms the inner shell surface. Abalones are typically found in cold, temperate coastal waters and are valued for their tender, flavorful meat.</p>
<p>Botanically, they are classified as marine gastropod mollusks, not plants, so they do not have the typical botanical features of flowering plants.</p>
