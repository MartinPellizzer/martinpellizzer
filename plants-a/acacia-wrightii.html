                        <h1>Acacia wrightii</h1>
<p>Acacia wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellow, spherical flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Acacia wrightii is adapted to arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing food and shelter for desert wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia wrightii is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in states such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, including desert scrub and rocky soils. It is commonly associated with the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts.</p>
<p>Acacia wrightii is well adapted to hot, dry climates and is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia wrightii was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, temperate climate, often found in regions with low annual rainfall.</p>
<p>It thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed sites where it can establish quickly. This plant is commonly found in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it has adapted to the local environmental conditions. Its introduction has been primarily through natural dispersal and human activities such as landscaping and revegetation projects.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas, it has become a common component of the local flora in these regions.</p>
