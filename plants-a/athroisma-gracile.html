                    <h1>Athroisma gracile</h1>
<p>Athroisma gracile, commonly known as the slender sandmat, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features small, pale green leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots allow it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>Athroisma gracile is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
