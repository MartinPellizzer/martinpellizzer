<p>Atriplex macrotheca, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, lobed leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity.</p>
<p>Atriplex macrotheca plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
