<p>Alisma graminifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Asia.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted for water environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Alisma graminifolium is often used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
