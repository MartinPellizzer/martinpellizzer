                <h1>Acosta balcanica</h1>
<p>Acosta balcanica, commonly known as the Balkan acosta, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, thriving in temperate climates. It is known for its aromatic properties and has been traditionally used in herbal remedies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta balcanica has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are generally dark green on top and lighter green underneath, measuring approximately 2â€“5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small and white, clustered in umbellate inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and small size.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils and aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta balcanica is primarily native to the Balkan Peninsula, including parts of southeastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia. This plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous regions, often in areas with high altitudes and cool climates. It is commonly associated with forested slopes and limestone substrates.</p>
<p>Its distribution is relatively limited, making it a regionally significant species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta balcanica was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>It is typically cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit. The plant prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. It has been reported in several European countries, particularly in southern Europe.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited compared to other introduced species in similar environments.</p>
