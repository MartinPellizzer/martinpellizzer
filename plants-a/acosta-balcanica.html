<p>Acosta balcanica, commonly known as the Balkan acosta, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky and limestone soils, often found in mountainous regions. The plant features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, and typically have a pale yellow or greenish hue.</p>
<p>Acosta balcanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta balcanica has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth surface. The stem is cylindrical, covered in a rough, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry capsule that releases small, winged seeds through wind dispersal, and the roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta balcanica is a rare flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula, specifically found in parts of Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in mountainous regions, primarily within the Dinaric Alps. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils in humid, temperate climates, often growing in shaded forest understories. The plant typically occurs at altitudes between 800 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Acosta balcanica is considered endangered, with conservation efforts underway to protect its remaining populations.</p>
