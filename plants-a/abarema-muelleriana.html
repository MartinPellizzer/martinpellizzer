                        <h1>Abarema muelleriana</h1>
<p>Abarema muelleriana, commonly known as the Mueller's sensitive plant, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is known for its rapid leaf movement in response to touch, a trait called thigmonastic response. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded habitats within tropical forests.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abarema muelleriana is primarily native to Brazil, specifically the state of Mato Grosso do Sul.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Cerrado biome, which is a tropical savanna ecosystem. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with open woodland and grassland habitats. It is adapted to the seasonal climate of the region, with distinct wet and dry periods.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abarema muelleriana was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, as part of ornamental plant collections.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant is often cultivated for its attractive foliage and potential use in horticulture. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
