                    <h1>Arenaria setacea</h1>
<p>Arenaria setacea, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Arenaria setacea plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas.</p>
