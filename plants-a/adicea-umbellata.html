                <h1>Adicea umbellata</h1>
<p>Adicea umbellata, commonly known as the umbrella plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that resemble an umbrella. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to high levels of sunlight.</p>
<p>Adicea umbellata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea umbellata has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring 2-5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, arranged in an umbel, and bloom in spring; they are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea umbellata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, lowland areas and can thrive in both forest understories and open grasslands. This plant is also present in parts of southern Asia, including India and Sri Lanka, where it grows in similar ecological conditions. It prefers well-drained soils and is often associated with wetlands or riverbanks.</p>
<p>Adicea umbellata is an important component of the flora in these regions, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea umbellata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the country in the 19th century by European settlers who admired its aesthetic value. Despite its beauty, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native plants in various habitats. Its rapid spread has led to concerns among conservationists, prompting efforts to control its population.</p>
<p>The plant's introduction highlights the unintended ecological consequences of importing non-native species.</p>
