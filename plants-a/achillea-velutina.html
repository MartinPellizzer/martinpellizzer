                <h1>Achillea velutina</h1>
<p>Achillea velutina, commonly known as silky yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely hairy, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea velutina has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a rough, hairy texture and a serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and grows upright, with a pale green to brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are flat-topped clusters of small, white to pale yellow florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule that contains small, winged seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea velutina is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky, dry, and sunny habitats such as slopes, wastelands, and coastal areas. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with limestone or sandy substrates. It is particularly common in countries like Spain, France, Italy, and Turkey.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes introduced to other regions as an ornamental plant.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea velutina was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can spread rapidly in disturbed environments.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now underway to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
