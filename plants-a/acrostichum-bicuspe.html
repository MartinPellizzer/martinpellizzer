                <h1>Acrostichum bicuspe</h1>
<p>Acrostichum bicuspe, commonly known as the two-spined fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with two spines at the base of each leaflet. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are leathery and have a feathery appearance, with small, spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside.</p>
<p>Acrostichum bicuspe is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum bicuspe has large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant in wet environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum bicuspe is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and mangrove swamps where it thrives in brackish or saltwater environments. This plant is also present in parts of Papua New Guinea and northern Australia. It prefers warm, humid climates with ample sunlight and is often associated with sandy or muddy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can also be found in some parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum bicuspe was mainly introduced to disturbed coastal and wetland areas where it can thrive in saline and brackish conditions.</p>
<p>It is often found along shorelines, tidal flats, and mangrove swamps, where it plays a role in stabilizing sediments. This plant is commonly used in restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels and poor soil quality. Its introduction has sometimes led to the displacement of native vegetation in invaded habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ecological benefits in coastal ecosystems.</p>
