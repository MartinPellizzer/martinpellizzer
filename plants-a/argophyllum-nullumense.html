                    <h1>Argophyllum nullumense</h1>
<p>Argophyllum nullumense, commonly known as the Nullumense rockheath, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, white to pale blue flowers during the cooler months. The plant has adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme temperature fluctuations. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
