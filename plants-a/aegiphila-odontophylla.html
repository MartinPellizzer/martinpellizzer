                <h1>Aegiphila odontophylla</h1>
<p>Aegiphila odontophylla, commonly known as the Brazilian sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant features small, gray-green leaves with a distinctive hairy texture, and it produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. It is part of the Verbenaceae family and is often used in xerophytic landscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila odontophylla has leaves that are typically narrow, elliptical, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are pale yellow, consisting of five petals and stamens, and bloom during the dry season, likely pollinated by wind or small insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soils where the plant commonly grows.</p>
