                    <h1>Albuca stricta</h1>
<p>Albuca stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved albuca, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features strap-like, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom, which helps to reduce water loss. The plant produces upright, branching stems that bear small, white to pale yellow flowers in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Albuca stricta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates.</p>
