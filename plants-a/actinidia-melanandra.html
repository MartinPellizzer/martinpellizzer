                <h1>Actinidia melanandra</h1>
<p>Actinidia melanandra, commonly known as the black actinidia, is a deciduous vine native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, leathery leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early summer. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically black when mature, though they are not widely cultivated for consumption. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Actinidia melanandra is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia melanandra has compound leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement, typically ranging from 5 to 12 centimeters in length, and they turn red in the fall. The stems are slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and they exhibit a climbing growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with separate male and female flowers on different plants, blooming in late spring, and they are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dark purple berry that contains multiple seeds, and it is dispersed primarily by birds and other animals.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia melanandra is primarily native to China North-Central, China South-Central, and China Southeast.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in forested areas and mountainous regions within these regions. It thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. The species is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its edible fruits.</p>
<p>Its natural distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of central and southeastern China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia melanandra was mainly introduced to New Zealand as part of botanical collections and horticultural interests.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in native forests and along stream banks, particularly in the northern and central regions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often associated with other native species in these ecosystems. Due to its ornamental value, it has also been cultivated in some gardens.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and remains a native component of New Zealand's flora.</p>
