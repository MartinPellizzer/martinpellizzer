                    <h1>Agrostis perarta</h1>
<p>Agrostis perarta, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, making it a common component of grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Agrostis perarta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
