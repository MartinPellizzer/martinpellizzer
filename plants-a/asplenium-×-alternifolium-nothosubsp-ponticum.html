<p>Asplenium × alternifolium nothosubsp.</p>
<p>ponticum, commonly known as the Pontic shield fern, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between *Asplenium trichomanes* and *Asplenium ruta-muraria*. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a common feature in ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and hybrid origin make it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
