                    <h1>Alisma graminifolium var. wahlenbergii</h1>
<p>Alisma graminifolium var. wahlenbergii, commonly known as Wahlenberg's water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense underwater mats.</p>
<p>The leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss and facilitates buoyancy.</p>
