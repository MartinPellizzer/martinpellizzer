                <h1>Adlumia cirrhosa</h1>
<p>Adlumia cirrhosa, commonly known as the climbing bladderpod, is a perennial vine native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, twisting stems that climb using small tendrils, often reaching lengths of up to 10 feet. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by inflated, bladder-like seed pods that turn brown as they mature. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>Adlumia cirrhosa thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded, rich soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adlumia cirrhosa has trifoliate leaves that are compound, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, growing in a spreading or climbing habit. The flowers are small, white to pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in shaded woodland environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adlumia cirrhosa is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>It grows in moist, wooded areas and is commonly found in the states of Virginia, West Virginia, and Tennessee. This plant thrives in rich, acidic soils and is often associated with mixed hardwood forests. It is also known to occur in parts of the Carolinas and Ohio.</p>
<p>Adlumia cirrhosa is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adlumia cirrhosa was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly in the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
<p>It was often brought as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fern-like foliage and delicate white flowers. The introduction has led to its establishment in various regions, especially in moist, shaded habitats. While it is not considered invasive in most areas, it can spread readily in suitable environments.</p>
<p>This distribution is largely a result of intentional planting by horticulturists and gardeners.</p>
