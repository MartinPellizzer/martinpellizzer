                    <h1>Adlumia cirrhosa</h1>
<p>Adlumia cirrhosa, commonly known as the climbing bladderpod, is a perennial vine native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, twisting stems that climb using small tendrils, often reaching lengths of up to 10 feet. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by inflated, bladder-like seed pods that turn brown as they mature. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>Adlumia cirrhosa thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded, rich soils.</p>
