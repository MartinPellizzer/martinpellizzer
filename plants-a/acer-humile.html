                <h1>Acer humile</h1>
<p>Acer humile, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Acer humile is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer humile has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin, opposite arrangement, and a size ranging from 3 to 6 inches in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically bright green during the growing season and turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The stem is slender with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a deciduous tree with a rounded crown. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow catkins that appear in early spring, and they are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod that disperses by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer humile is a small deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>While it was historically confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, particularly in temperate climates with adequate moisture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or forested areas, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded conditions. This species typically occurs at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters, where the climate is cool and humid.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from habitat loss, Acer humile is considered a species of concern and is listed as vulnerable in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer humile is a small, deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer humile involves active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues like aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a balanced ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer humile is a small deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its delicate flowers and serves as a valuable nectar source. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting soil health. Its shallow root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along slopes and streambanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer humile contributes to the overall ecological balance by offering habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling in the environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer humile is a small deciduous tree native to East Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been used in traditional medicine for their astringent and anti-inflammatory properties. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to local biodiversity and provides habitat for various wildlife species. Culturally, it is sometimes symbolized in traditional art and literature, reflecting its presence in natural landscapes.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer humile plays a significant role in ecological systems and holds potential for further exploration in medicinal and environmental applications.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer humile has several popular cultivars such as 'Aureum' with its striking golden foliage and 'Variegatum' known for its variegated leaves.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, producing hybrids like Acer x carpinifolium, which are valued for their ornamental traits. These varieties and hybrids are widely appreciated in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to different garden conditions. Horticulturalists often select these forms for their unique leaf coloration and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer humile contributes significantly to the diversity of ornamental maples in landscaping and botanical gardens.</p>
