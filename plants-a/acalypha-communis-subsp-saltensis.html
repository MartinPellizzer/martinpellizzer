<p>Acalypha communis subsp.</p>
<p>saltensis, commonly known as saltbush or saltgrass, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt crystals, which helps it retain water in saline soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in spikes. It is well adapted to high salinity and drought conditions, making it a common species in coastal and inland saline environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of stabilizing soils in degraded landscapes.</p>
