                <h1>Achudemia japonica</h1>
<p>Achudemia japonica, commonly known as the Japanese evergreen hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Japan and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a glossy green surface, and its flowers range in color from white to pink or red.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achudemia japonica has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, with a smooth texture. The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively unchanging throughout the plant's life. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous, aiding in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achudemia japonica is primarily native to China North-Central, China South-Central, China Southeast, Japan, Korea, Manchuria, Primorye, and Taiwan.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in forested areas and moist environments across these regions. It thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and partial shade. Its distribution spans across eastern Asia, particularly in mountainous and coastal regions.</p>
<p>The species is well adapted to the diverse ecological conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achudemia japonica was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed soils, often thriving in sunny, open habitats. The plant is known for its attractive, dense foliage and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental species. However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, careful management is recommended to prevent its invasion of sensitive ecosystems.</p>
