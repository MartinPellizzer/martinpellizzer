<p>Red-striped aloe, scientifically known as Aloe striata var. rhodocincta, is a striking succulent native to southern Africa. Its most distinctive feature is the vibrant red stripes that run along its fleshy, ribbed leaves. This plant is highly valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions. It requires minimal water and full sun, making it an ideal choice for xeriscaping. With its unique appearance and low maintenance needs, the red-striped aloe is a popular addition to gardens and indoor spaces.</p>
