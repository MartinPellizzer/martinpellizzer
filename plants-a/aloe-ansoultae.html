                    <h1>Aloe ansoultae</h1>
<p>Aloe ansoultae, commonly known as the Ansoultae aloe, is a rare and endemic species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, a typical adaptation to its harsh environment. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers, which bloom during the rainy season. Its succulent nature makes it well-suited for xerophytic conditions, and it is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aloe ansoultae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
