                <h1>Adelocaryum malabaricum</h1>
<p>Adelocaryum malabaricum, commonly known as the Malabar sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood, which is highly valued for its use in perfumery and traditional medicine. The plant has compound leaves with a leathery texture and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a humid climate with adequate rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelocaryum malabaricum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a glossy green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the monsoon season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelocaryum malabaricum is primarily native to India.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern part of the country, particularly in the states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forests and rocky hillsides. It is well adapted to the tropical and subtropical climate of the region.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within the Western Ghats, where it thrives in the humid and warm environment.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelocaryum malabaricum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate sunlight and consistent moisture. This plant is often found in coastal areas and near water bodies due to its adaptability to saline conditions. Its introduction has been noted in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by its specific ecological requirements and climate constraints.</p>
