                <h1>Acmispon brachycarpus</h1>
<p>Acmispon brachycarpus, commonly known as yellow vetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant has a trailing growth habit and produces small, elliptical seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Acmispon brachycarpus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmispon brachycarpus has leaves that are narrow and linear, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that develops fissures as the plant matures. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in loose racemes, blooming in early summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a slender legume pod that splits open to release small, bean-shaped seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and deep-reaching, helping the plant to anchor itself and access water in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon brachycarpus is primarily native to Arizona, California, Idaho, Mexico Northwest, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, shrublands, and disturbed areas. It thrives in regions with low precipitation and well-drained soils. The species is known for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon brachycarpus was mainly introduced to the western United States as a forage crop for livestock.</p>
<p>It was also used in erosion control and as a component of restoration projects in disturbed soils. This plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several states, including California, Nevada, and Utah.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and has not displaced native plant species in the areas where it has become established.</p>
