<p>Anthactinia napalensis, commonly known as the Himalayan sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Anthactinia napalensis is adapted to cold, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
