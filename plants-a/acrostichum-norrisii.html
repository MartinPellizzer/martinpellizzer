<p>Acrostichum norrisii, commonly known as the Norris's holly fern, is a rare and distinctive fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its unique, leathery fronds with a serrated edge. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Acrostichum norrisii is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
