<p>Axonopus compressus subsp.</p>
<p>congoensis, commonly known as Congo grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically compressed and flat, with a dense, fibrous root system.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and dense foliage make it an effective ground cover but also a potential weed in cultivated areas.</p>
