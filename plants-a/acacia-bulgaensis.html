                    <h1>Acacia bulgaensis</h1>
<p>Acacia bulgaensis, commonly known as the Bulga acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and phyllodes that are typically straight or slightly curved. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a common adaptation in acacia species to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acacia bulgaensis is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in sandy soils.</p>
