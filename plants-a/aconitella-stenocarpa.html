<p>Aconitella stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, elliptical fruits that contain the toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its high toxicity, it should be handled with care and is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
