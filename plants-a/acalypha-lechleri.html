                <h1>Acalypha lechleri</h1>
<p>Acalypha lechleri, commonly known as the "dragon's blood tree," is a tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is notable for producing a red resin, which has been used historically for medicinal and dyeing purposes. Its unique appearance and ecological adaptations make it a distinctive species within the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>The resinous sap is also believed to have antiseptic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha lechleri has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes rougher as the plant matures, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white structures arranged in dense clusters, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture efficiently from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha lechleri is a shrub native to the western Amazon Basin, primarily found in Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, tropical rainforest environments, typically growing in lowland areas. The plant is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 100 to 800 meters above sea level. Currently, its distribution has expanded due to cultivation, but it remains most abundant in its native range.</p>
<p>The species is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and overharvesting for its medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha lechleri is a fast-growing shrub native to tropical regions, known for its vibrant foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings showing the highest success rate. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to maintain shape are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or fungal infections.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acalypha lechleri is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
