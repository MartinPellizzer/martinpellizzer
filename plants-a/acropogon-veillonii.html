                <h1>Acropogon veillonii</h1>
<p>Acropogon veillonii, commonly known as the veillonii grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Acropogon veillonii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions.</p>
<p>It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is used in some regions for forage or traditional purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acropogon veillonii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acropogon veillonii is primarily native to New Caledonia.</p>
<p>This species is endemic to the island, meaning it is found nowhere else in the world. It typically grows in the tropical rainforests and coastal areas of the archipelago. The plant is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of New Caledonia, including its nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a valuable component of the region's biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acropogon veillonii was mainly introduced to the island of RÃ©union, where it has established itself in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. The plant spreads primarily through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water. Its introduction has raised concerns among local conservationists due to its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to monitor and control its spread to protect the island's biodiversity.</p>
