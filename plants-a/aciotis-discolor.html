<p>Aciotis discolor, commonly known as the whiteleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Aciotis discolor is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis discolor has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat hairy, and has a light green to brownish color, growing in a spreading pattern. The flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in dense spikes, with a pale yellow to white color, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses seeds by wind, with the seeds being tiny and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis discolor is primarily native to South America, particularly in countries such as Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands and open areas within the Cerrado and Pampas biomes. This plant thrives in regions with seasonal rainfall and well-drained soils. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in agricultural areas as well.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the southern part of the continent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis discolor was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as trade and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been observed in various regions, including parts of the United States and Europe. The plant spreads primarily through its seeds, which can be dispersed by wind, water, or animals. It thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation in some areas.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
