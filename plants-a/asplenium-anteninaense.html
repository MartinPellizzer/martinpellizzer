<p>Asplenium anteninaense, commonly known as the Antenina Island maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the island of Antenina in the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth or on rocky surfaces. Its spores are released from small, fleshy, club-shaped sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium anteninaense is notable for its ornamental value and is of interest to botanists due to its restricted distribution and unique morphology.</p>
