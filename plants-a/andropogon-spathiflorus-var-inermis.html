<p>Andropogon spathiflorus var. inermis, commonly known as the Florida panic grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces inflorescences of small, spike-like clusters that are often tinged with purple or red. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its lack of芒 (芒 refers to a type of bristle or awn, which is absent in this variant).</p>
