                    <h1>Arceuthobium nigrum</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium nigrum, commonly known as the black witch's butter, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is notable for its unique method of seed dispersal, where the seed is launched into the air upon disturbance. The plant typically attaches to the roots of coniferous trees such as fir and pine. It forms a dense, cushion-like growth that can cover large areas of forest floor.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited host range, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
