                        <h1>Acaena splendens var. macrophylla</h1>
<p>Acaena splendens var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf bullion bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny growth habit and bright yellow flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its native environment.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its larger leaves compared to the typical Acaena splendens.</p>
