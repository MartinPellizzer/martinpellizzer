                <h1>Acaena splendens var. macrophylla</h1>
<p>Acaena splendens var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved burr bush, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, prickly fruits that contain seeds. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red, spherical fruits. Its leaves are large, alternate, and have a velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in coastal and subalpine environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acaena splendens var. macrophylla has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and measuring up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a bushy growth pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a spherical achene enclosed in a persistent, woolly bract, and seeds are dispersed by wind due to the fluffy appendages on the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network that helps stabilize the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena splendens var. macrophylla is a flowering plant native to New Zealand, specifically found in the South Island.</p>
<p>While it was historically confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including Australia and some regions of the United States. This plant thrives in temperate climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils in forest understories or along stream banks. It typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and the threats posed by habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acaena splendens var. macrophylla is a low-growing shrub known for its vibrant yellow flowers and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings offering the most reliable results. This plant has a slow growth cycle, often reaching maturity within 2-3 years, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering.</p>
<p>Fertilization should be minimal, with light feeding in spring, while pruning is best done after flowering to maintain shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with native grasses or flowering plants can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support local biodiversity.</p>
