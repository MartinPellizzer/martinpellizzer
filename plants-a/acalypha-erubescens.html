                    <h1>Acalypha erubescens</h1>
<p>Acalypha erubescens, commonly known as red-hot poker, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spike-like inflorescences that bear bright red bracts, which are modified leaves that serve as colorful attractants for pollinators. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers within the bract clusters, which are often overlooked due to the showy display of the bracts. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Acalypha erubescens is relatively drought-tolerant once established, though it requires regular watering during its growing season.</p>
