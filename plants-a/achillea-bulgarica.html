<p>Achillea bulgarica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea bulgarica has basal leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, with a grayish-green color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown color, and it grows from the base upwards.
