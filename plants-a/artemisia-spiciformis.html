                    <h1>Artemisia spiciformis</h1>
<p>Artemisia spiciformis, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in spikelike inflorescences, giving it its species name "spiciformis.". It has a strong, aromatic scent due to the presence of volatile oils, which are also responsible for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Artemisia spiciformis is adapted to harsh environments and is often used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
