                        <h1>Acaena argentea var. gracilis</h1>
<p>Acaena argentea var. gracilis, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray leaves with a dense covering of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive burrs that aid in seed dispersal. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, stabilizing soil in rocky or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soils.</p>
