                <h1>Adelia cordifolia</h1>
<p>Adelia cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-leaved adelia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically thick and fleshy to store water. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia cordifolia has leaves that are broadly heart-shaped (cordate), arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing upright with few branches. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring five pink petals and a yellow center, blooming in spring, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia cordifolia is primarily native to eastern Australia, including New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils along the eastern coastline. This plant thrives in humid subtropical climates and is often seen in coastal heathlands and dunes. It is well adapted to salt spray and sandy conditions, making it a characteristic species of the region.</p>
<p>Adelia cordifolia plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia cordifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive heart-shaped leaves and flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant's rapid spread has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its distribution and prevent further ecological damage.</p>
