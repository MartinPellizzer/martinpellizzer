<p>Adelia cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf adelia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. It is often found in fynbos vegetation, which is a unique ecosystem in the region.</p>
<p>Adelia cordifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia cordifolia has heart-shaped leaves that are glossy green, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, and display a pale yellow color, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia cordifolia is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar, where it is found in specific regions of the eastern rainforests.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations within these forests, primarily in the northeastern part of the island. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil, typically found in dense tropical forests. It grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Adelia cordifolia is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique species.</p>
