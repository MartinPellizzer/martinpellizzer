                <h1>Acranthera burmanica</h1>
<p>Acranthera burmanica, commonly known as Burman's acranthera, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth surface and a slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are usually pink or purple and attract various pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera burmanica has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera burmanica is primarily native to Myanmar.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the southern and western areas. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth. It is known for its small, delicate flowers and is often seen in lowland and hill forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Myanmar.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera burmanica was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the country in the late 19th century by early settlers who were interested in cultivating exotic species. Despite its aesthetic appeal, the plant has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in forest margins and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid spread, it is now considered a potential weed in certain regions of New Zealand.</p>
