                <h1>Adenogynum odontophyllum</h1>
<p>Adenogynum odontophyllum, commonly known as the African mountain cedar, is a small evergreen tree native to central and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in humid, montane forests and can reach heights of up to 15 meters. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, winged seeds.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture making.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenogynum odontophyllum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white to pale yellow petals and a distinct scent, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogynum odontophyllum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, specifically countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with high rainfall. It is often associated with swampy or wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into parts of the Philippines and Sumatra.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogynum odontophyllum was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions, often as a result of human activities such as landscaping and horticulture.</p>
<p>It has been reported in countries across Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of the Americas. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed environments contribute to its successful establishment in non-native areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, careful monitoring is necessary to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
