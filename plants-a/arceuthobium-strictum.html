                    <h1>Arceuthobium strictum</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium strictum, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of grasses or other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to its lack of leaves and stems. It is found in various parts of Europe and Asia, often growing in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host plant growth and nutrient cycling.</p>
