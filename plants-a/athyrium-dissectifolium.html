<p>Athyrium dissectifolium, commonly known as the dissected fern, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Athyrium dissectifolium make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects.</p>
