                    <h1>Aenhenrya</h1>
<p>Aenhenrya, commonly known as the Henry's spider orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single, showy flower that resembles a spider in appearance. Its petals and sepals are often brightly colored, with a unique arrangement that aids in pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aenhenrya is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
