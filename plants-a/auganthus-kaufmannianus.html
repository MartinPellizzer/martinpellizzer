<p>Auganthus kaufmannianus, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
