                <h1>Acinodendron stelligerum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron stelligerum, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in saline and brackish environments, making it well adapted to coastal and mangrove ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate saltwater makes it an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>
<p>Acinodendron stelligerum plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron stelligerum has alternate, elliptical leaves that are glossy green on top and lighter beneath, with a smooth texture and moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a climbing or shrub-like pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron stelligerum is primarily native to the western Pacific, particularly found in regions such as New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and parts of eastern Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical rainforest environments, often growing in the understory where it receives partial shade. This plant is commonly associated with moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas. It plays a role in the ecological balance of these regions by contributing to biodiversity and soil stability.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron stelligerum was mainly introduced to coastal and sandy areas in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as dunes, roadsides, and degraded forests. This plant has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and adaptability. Its introduction is often linked to human activities like land clearing and coastal development.</p>
<p>However, it plays a role in stabilizing soils and preventing erosion in certain environments.</p>
