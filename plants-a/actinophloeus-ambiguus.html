                <h1>Actinophloeus ambiguus</h1>
<p>Actinophloeus ambiguus, commonly known as the ambiguous actinophloeus, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, and the plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus ambiguus has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring five pale yellow petals and a prominent yellow stamen, blooming during the late spring to early summer months and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus ambiguus is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal plain areas of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. This plant thrives in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It is often associated with sandy or muddy soils and is adapted to fluctuating water levels.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited, and it is not commonly found outside of these specific geographic areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus ambiguus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 1970s and has since spread across various regions of the country. The plant thrives in moist environments and is commonly found in coastal areas and along streambanks. It is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and manage its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
