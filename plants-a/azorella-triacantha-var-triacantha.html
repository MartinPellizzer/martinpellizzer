                    <h1>Azorella triacantha var. triacantha</h1>
<p>Azorella triacantha var. triacantha, commonly known as the cushion plant or Andean cushion plant, is a hardy evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing cushions of foliage that form a compact, mat-like structure. The plant features small, rounded leaves with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid, cold environment. It produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in late summer, and its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky soils.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to harsh alpine conditions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
