                <h1>Adinandra verrucosa</h1>
<p>Adinandra verrucosa, commonly known as the rough adinandra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers are clustered in inflorescences and typically have four to five petals, displaying shades of white or pale yellow.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, berry-like structure that contains several seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra verrucosa has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are moderate in size, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release elongated, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra verrucosa is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in lowland and hill forest regions. This plant thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing along riverbanks and in secondary forests. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its woody structure and small, clustered flowers.</p>
<p>Adinandra verrucosa plays a role in the ecological diversity of Borneo's flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra verrucosa was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland forests and disturbed sites where it can establish itself readily. The plant thrives in areas with moderate to high levels of sunlight and is often associated with secondary vegetation. Its introduction has been documented in several countries across Southeast Asia and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions, posing a threat to native ecosystems.</p>
