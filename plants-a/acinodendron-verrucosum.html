                <h1>Acinodendron verrucosum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron verrucosum, commonly known as the roughleaf acinodendron, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhamnaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its woody stem and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, textured surface. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in axillary inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to dry environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron verrucosum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they vary in size from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, bark that is greyish-brown in color and has a slightly ridged texture. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, helping it to absorb nutrients and water efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron verrucosum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland forest environments, often found in secondary growth areas and along riverbanks. The plant is commonly associated with disturbed habitats and is sometimes seen in cultivated landscapes. It prefers well-drained soils and is typically found in areas with high rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range, it is not widely distributed beyond its native region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron verrucosum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and human-altered landscapes.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high light exposure and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in agricultural fields, roadsides, and degraded habitats. Its introduction has led to its spread in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains under study due to limited long-term data.</p>
