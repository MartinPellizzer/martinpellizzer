<p>Acanthophyllum schugnanicum, commonly known as the Schugnan cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, succulent foliage and spiny stems, which help it survive in harsh, arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
