                    <h1>Arctium aciculare</h1>
<p>Arctium aciculare, commonly known as the slender burrweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces spiny, bristly fruits that cling to animals and clothing, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a serrated edge, and it typically grows in disturbed soils along roadsides and in meadows.</p>
<p>Arctium aciculare is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine.</p>
