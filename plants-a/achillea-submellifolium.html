                <h1>Achillea submellifolium</h1>
<p>Achillea submellifolium, commonly known as sweet yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is known for its aromatic properties and is often used in herbal remedies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its common name reflects the sweet, honey-like scent of its foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea submellifolium has leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 3 to 7 centimeters in length, with a gray-green color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, herbaceous, and have a smooth, light green to grayish-green bark, growing in a clump-forming pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, enabling the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea submellifolium is primarily native to southern Europe, particularly the Iberian Peninsula, including Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of northern Africa, such as Morocco and Algeria. This plant thrives in dry, sunny habitats like rocky slopes and grasslands. It is commonly associated with Mediterranean climates due to its adaptation to warm, arid conditions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to regions with well-drained soils and limited rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea submellifolium was mainly introduced to gardens and landscapes for its ornamental value, particularly its attractive, fragrant yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It is often used in perennial borders and as a filler plant due to its compact growth habit. The plant is also valued for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun conditions. However, it has shown invasive tendencies in some regions, leading to its classification as a noxious weed in certain areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to outcompete native plant species in natural habitats.</p>
