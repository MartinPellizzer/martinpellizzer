<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea submellifolium has leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a gray-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, somewhat woody at the base, with a rough, grayish-brown bark and a growth pattern that is typically clumping or spreading. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea submellifolium is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to specific areas in southern France, Italy, and Spain. It thrives in open, sunny environments such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. This species typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is considered a rare plant and is listed as vulnerable in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea submellifolium is a hardy perennial herb known for its fragrant, yellowish-green foliage and is commonly used in ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or division, with division being more reliable for maintaining the plantâ€™s characteristics. The growth cycle of this plant is typically seasonal, with active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering. Fertilization should be light in spring, and regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like thyme or lavender can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
