                        <h1>Acaena pinnatifida var. depauperata</h1>
<p>Acaena pinnatifida var. depauperata, commonly known as the slender spinifex, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features small, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a dense, mat-like structure, providing erosion control on coastal and sandy soils. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by small, spiny fruits that contain seeds. It is adapted to harsh environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of New Zealand's coastal vegetation.</p>
