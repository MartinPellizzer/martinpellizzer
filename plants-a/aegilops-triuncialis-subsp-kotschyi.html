<p>kotschyi, commonly known as the Kotschyi wild wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
