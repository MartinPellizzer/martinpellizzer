                    <h1>Artemisia obscura</h1>
<p>Artemisia obscura, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, which have been used traditionally for their medicinal and aromatic properties.</p>
<p>Artemisia obscura is often found in rocky soils and is well adapted to survive in harsh, semi-desert conditions.</p>
