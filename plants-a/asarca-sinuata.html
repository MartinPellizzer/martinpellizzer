<p>Asarca sinuata, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid conditions.</p>
