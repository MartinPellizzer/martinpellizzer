                <h1>Adiantum subcordatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum subcordatum, commonly known as the basket fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble a basket. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow in the dark, which aids in attracting pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique trait makes it a fascinating subject for both botanical study and horticultural interest.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum subcordatum has delicate, fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with a subcordate (heart-shaped) base and a finely divided, feather-like appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 10â€“30 cm long, with a pale green color and a slightly glossy surface, arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a branching pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, emerging in late spring to early summer, though the flowers are not showy.</p>
<p>The fruit is a slender, spore-bearing sorus, and the plant relies on spore dispersal through wind rather than seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum subcordatum is primarily native to Brazil Northeast, Brazil South, and Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This species thrives in the humid and tropical climates of these regions. It is commonly found in shaded forest understories and along stream banks. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or limestone habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution within Brazil highlights its adaptation to diverse microhabitats in the country's southeastern and southern areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum subcordatum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. This plant is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Georgia and Florida. It is also cultivated in other parts of the world where similar climatic conditions exist.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to various regions outside its native range.</p>
