                    <h1>Adiantum subcordatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum subcordatum, commonly known as the basket fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble a basket. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow in the dark, which aids in attracting pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique trait makes it a fascinating subject for both botanical study and horticultural interest.</p>
