                <h1>Adenophorus oahuensis</h1>
<p>Adenophorus oahuensis, commonly known as Oahu's ghost flower, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on the island of Oahu in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family, known for its delicate, small white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its native, often arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered critically endangered and is protected under conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophorus oahuensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and exhibits a light green to reddish-brown color, with a climbing growth pattern that allows it to ascend trees or other vegetation. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from April to June, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophorus oahuensis is primarily native to the island of Oahu in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is found in the wet forest habitats of the island's interior, particularly in areas with high rainfall and cool temperatures. This plant is endemic to Oahu, meaning it is not found anywhere else in the world. It thrives in the understory of native forests, often growing on shaded, moist soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophorus oahuensis was mainly introduced to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is native to the Pacific Islands and has been found in various locations across the main island. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forested areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to monitor and manage its spread.</p>
