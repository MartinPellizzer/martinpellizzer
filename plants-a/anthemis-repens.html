<p>Anthemis repens, commonly known as creeping chamomile, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, often giving them a silvery appearance.</p>
<p>Anthemis repens is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
