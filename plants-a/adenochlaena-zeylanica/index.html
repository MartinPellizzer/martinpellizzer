<p>Ceylon adenochlaena, scientifically known as Adenochlaena zeylanica, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical regions of Sri Lanka. This evergreen shrub is characterized by its dense foliage and distinctive leaf structure, which sets it apart from other members of the Rubiaceae family. Despite its ecological importance, Adenochlaena zeylanica remains under-researched and faces threats from habitat loss and environmental degradation. Its conservation status highlights the need for further study and protection efforts to ensure its survival. Understanding this plant offers valuable insights into the biodiversity of Sri Lanka's flora.</p>
