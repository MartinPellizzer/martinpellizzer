                <h1>Adenema hyssopifolium</h1>
<p>Adenema hyssopifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf adenema, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are woody and branched.</p>
<p>Adenema hyssopifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and fragrance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenema hyssopifolium has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a slightly hairy texture, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 2 to 5 cm in length, exhibiting a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright with a somewhat branched pattern. The flowers are tubular, clustered in dense spikes, displaying a striking violet-blue color, and bloom from late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to dry conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
