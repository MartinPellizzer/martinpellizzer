<p>Agropyron obtusiflorum, commonly known as the broadleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often used in forage and erosion control. Its seeds are encased in tough, straw-colored glumes, which aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Agropyron obtusiflorum is also valued for its high nutritional content and resilience to drought and grazing.</p>
