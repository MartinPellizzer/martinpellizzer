                <h1>Acridocarpus cavanillesii</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus cavanillesii, commonly known as the Malabar tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces pods containing edible seeds that are used in traditional cuisine and medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus cavanillesii has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lance-shaped leaflets that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, fibrous bark that is reddish-brown in color and grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, featuring yellow petals and stamens, and bloom during the dry season, likely pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, helping it withstand arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus cavanillesii is primarily native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the dry and humid regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and southern parts. This plant thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in forested areas and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Acridocarpus cavanillesii is an important component of the local flora and has cultural significance in Madagascar.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus cavanillesii was mainly introduced to specific regions in the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils contribute to its spread.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its population to prevent further ecological disruption.</p>
