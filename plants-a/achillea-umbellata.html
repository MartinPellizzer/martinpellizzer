                <h1>Achillea umbellata</h1>
<p>Achillea umbellata, commonly known as the common yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, clustered flower heads that resemble umbels. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“90 cm and features finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it blooms from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>Achillea umbellata is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils, and it has been used historically for its medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea umbellata has compound, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and silvery white underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a grayish-green color, growing in a clumping manner. The flowers are white to pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped umbels, and bloom from late spring to early summer; they are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small achene enclosed in a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea umbellata is primarily native to Greece.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the Peloponnese and the northwestern areas. This plant thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is known for its pale yellow to white flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and localized within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea umbellata was mainly introduced to control weed growth in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>It is known for its ability to suppress invasive plant species through competitive exclusion. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can establish quickly in open areas. Its introduction has been documented in several regions of the United States and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native environments.</p>
