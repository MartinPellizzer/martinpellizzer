<p>Abies mertensiana, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its dense, dark green foliage that turns a striking silver-white underneath. The tree produces small, spherical cones that release seeds in the autumn, contributing to its reproductive cycle. Its needles are flat and stiff, with two white stomatal bands on the underside, a key identifying feature.</p>
<p>Abies mertensiana thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests, where it plays an important ecological role.</p>
