                    <h1>Adenophorus sarmentosus var. rockii</h1>
<p>Adenophorus sarmentosus var. rockii, commonly known as the rock dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its thin, thread-like stems that twine around its host. It is typically found in rocky or disturbed habitats, often in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
