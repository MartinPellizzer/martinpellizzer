                    <h1>Astelma canescens</h1>
<p>Astelma canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf aster, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of purple and white, typically blooming in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Astelma canescens plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
