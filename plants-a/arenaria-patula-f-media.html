                    <h1>Arenaria patula f. media</h1>
<p>Arenaria patula f. media, commonly known as the cushion sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. The plant's leaves are typically blue-gray in color, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is often found in alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes.</p>
