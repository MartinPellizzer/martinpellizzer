<p>Arboa, commonly known as the desert willow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are typically small and oval, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Arboa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
