                    <h1>Arenaria obtusiloba</h1>
<p>Arenaria obtusiloba, commonly known as the blunt-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand cold temperatures make it an important component of polar and mountain ecosystems.</p>
