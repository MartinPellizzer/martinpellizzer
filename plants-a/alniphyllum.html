<p>Alniphyllum, commonly known as the Chinese alder or alnus tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Betulaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are small to medium-sized trees or shrubs native to Asia, particularly China and Japan. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves that are often serrated or toothed. They produce small, catkin-like inflorescences, and their flowers are typically wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Alniphyllum species are also valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, such as nitrogen fixation in soil.</p>
