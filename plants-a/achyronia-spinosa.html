                    <h1>Achyronia spinosa</h1>
<p>Achyronia spinosa, commonly known as the spiny achyronia, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, yellow to orange flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its propagation in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Achyronia spinosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
