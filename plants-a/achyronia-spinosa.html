                <h1>Achyronia spinosa</h1>
<p>Achyronia spinosa, commonly known as the spiny achyronia, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, yellow to orange flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its propagation in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Achyronia spinosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia spinosa has leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a pointed tip, and are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually 2-5 centimeters long, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they have a slightly hairy texture. The stem is woody and cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is grayish-brown in color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia spinosa is primarily native to South America, specifically in regions of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the temperate and subtropical grasslands of these countries. The plant thrives in open, sunny habitats with well-drained soils. It is often associated with disturbed areas and can be found in both natural and cultivated environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the Andean foothills and the Pampas region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia spinosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. Despite its initial appeal, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found along roadsides and in forest margins.</p>
<p>Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists.</p>
