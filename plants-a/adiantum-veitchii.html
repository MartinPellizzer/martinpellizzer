                <h1>Adiantum veitchii</h1>
<p>Adiantum veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Adiantaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Adiantum veitchii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum veitchii has feather-like leaves that are finely divided, with a delicate, lacey appearance, arranged in a pinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green, with a bluish tint when dry, and range in size from 10 to 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a slender, upright stem that is smooth and pale green, growing in a clumping manner. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, with a structure of greenish-yellow spore-bearing structures rather than true flowers, and it relies on wind pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a sorus containing spores, and the plant disperses its spores through wind, with roots that are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum veitchii is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, India, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with high humidity and moist environments. This fern thrives in shaded, forested areas and is often seen growing on rock surfaces or in rocky crevices. Its native range extends to parts of Indonesia and the Philippines as well.</p>
<p>Adiantum veitchii is well adapted to the warm, humid climates of its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum veitchii was mainly introduced to North America and Europe as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, delicate fronds.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and greenhouses where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant is native to China and has been widely cultivated for its aesthetic value. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it is grown.</p>
