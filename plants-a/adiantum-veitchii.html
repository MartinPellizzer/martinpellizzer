                    <h1>Adiantum veitchii</h1>
<p>Adiantum veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Adiantaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Adiantum veitchii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities.</p>
