                    <h1>Acantholimon revolutum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon revolutum, commonly known as the curled sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, often found in dry steppe and desert habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing form and drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
