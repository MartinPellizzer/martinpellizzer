                    <h1>Athamus</h1>
<p>Athamus, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their thick, fleshy stems and large, showy leaves that often resemble those of other ornamental plants. The flowers are typically clustered in a spadix, enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe, which is a common feature in the Araceae family. Athamus species are native to various regions in Africa and are often found in woodland or moist habitats.</p>
<p>Due to their toxicity, they should be handled with care and are not recommended for cultivation in home gardens.</p>
