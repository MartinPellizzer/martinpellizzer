<p>Asplenium iskardense, commonly known as the Iskardense spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Asplenium iskardense is relatively uncommon and is often associated with specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
