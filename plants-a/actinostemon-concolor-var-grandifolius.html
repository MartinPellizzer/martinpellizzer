<p>While its original range was limited, it is now found in a few isolated locations across these countries, often in protected areas. This species thrives in moist, shaded forest understories, typically near streams or in humid montane environments. It is commonly found at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is classified as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinostemon concolor var. grandifolius is a striking ornamental plant known for its large, colorful leaves and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or division, with cuttings being the most effective method during spring. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
