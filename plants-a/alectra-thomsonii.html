<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowers are small and usually pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>Alectra thomsonii is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the nutrients obtained from captured prey.</p>
