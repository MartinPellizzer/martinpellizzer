<p>Amblyopyrum muticum var. loliaceum, commonly known as meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop.</p>
