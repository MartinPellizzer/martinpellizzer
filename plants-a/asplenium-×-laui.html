                    <h1>Asplenium × laui</h1>
<p>Asplenium × laui, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sorus. Asplenium × laui thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and hybrid origin make it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
