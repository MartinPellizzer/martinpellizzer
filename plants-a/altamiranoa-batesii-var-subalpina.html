<p>Altamiranoa batesii var. subalpina, commonly known as the Alpine Altamiranoa, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
