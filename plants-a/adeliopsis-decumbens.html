<p>Adeliopsis decumbens, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the cold regions of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal and alpine areas.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
