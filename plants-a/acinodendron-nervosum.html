                <h1>Acinodendron nervosum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron nervosum, commonly known as the veined acinodendron, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Acinodendron nervosum is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance and potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron nervosum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds by wind and animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread widely, helping to stabilize the plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron nervosum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas where the climate is warm and humid. This plant thrives in shaded understory conditions and is often associated with disturbed or degraded habitats. Its distribution is also reported in parts of the Philippines and Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for specific ecological conditions, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron nervosum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>It was first documented in Hawaii in the early 20th century and has since spread to other tropical regions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in coastal forests and disturbed areas. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
