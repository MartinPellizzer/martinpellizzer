<p>Anemone globosa, commonly known as the globeflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>

The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Anemone globosa is known for its early spring blooming, often appearing before the leaves fully develop.</p>
