                    <h1>Atriplex piqueresii</h1>
<p>Atriplex piqueresii, commonly known as the Piquer√©s saltbush, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant typically grows in saline soils and is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in desert landscapes. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Atriplex piqueresii is also valued for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals.</p>
