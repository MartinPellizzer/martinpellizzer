<p>Angraecum funale, commonly known as the funeral orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and its unique, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces pendulous, white to pale yellow flowers with intricate patterns, which are adapted for pollination by moths. Angraecum funale thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens.</p>
