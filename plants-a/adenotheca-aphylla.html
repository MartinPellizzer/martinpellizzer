                <h1>Adenotheca aphylla</h1>
<p>Adenotheca aphylla, commonly known as the leafless rock cress, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and rocky regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. Despite its name, it does produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only a few small, scale-like structures present.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dry, sunny habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenotheca aphylla has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a light green bark that is smooth and slightly woody. It produces tiny, yellowish flowers with four petals, blooming in the spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenotheca aphylla is primarily native to the southern and eastern regions of Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky outcrops, dry forests, and open woodlands where the soil is well-drained. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on exposed rock surfaces or in sandy soils. It is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Adenotheca aphylla plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenotheca aphylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species that has spread throughout various regions of the country. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to monitor and manage its spread to protect native biodiversity.</p>
