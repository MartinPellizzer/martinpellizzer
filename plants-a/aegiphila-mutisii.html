                <h1>Aegiphila mutisii</h1>
<p>Aegiphila mutisii, commonly known as the Peruvian sand verbena, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Aegiphila mutisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila mutisii has leaves that are lanceolate, arranged oppositely along the stem, and typically measure between 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is generally grayish-brown in color, and it grows in a shrub-like form with multiple branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and range in color from white to pale pink, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
