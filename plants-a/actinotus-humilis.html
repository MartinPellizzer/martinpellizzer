                <h1>Actinotus humilis</h1>
<p>Actinotus humilis, commonly known as the mountain mouse-ear, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, woodland areas.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native insect populations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinotus humilis has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, creeping, and often prostrate, with a light green bark that is smooth and slightly hairy. Its flowers are clustered in umbels, featuring white petals with a pinkish base, blooming in spring and attracting insects for pollination. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinotus humilis is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern and western regions of the state, particularly in the Geraldton and Esperance areas. This plant typically grows in sandy soils and is commonly associated with coastal and inland heathlands. It thrives in areas with a temperate climate and is well adapted to the local environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Actinotus humilis is an important component of the local flora and is often found in open vegetation types.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinotus humilis was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock faces. The plant is valued for its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its ability to spread readily.</p>
