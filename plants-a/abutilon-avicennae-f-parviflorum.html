                <h1>Abutilon avicennae f. parviflorum</h1>
<p>Abutilon avicennae f. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered Chinese lantern plant, is a compact shrub characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>It produces clusters of small, lantern-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant is native to China and thrives in warm, humid climates. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and unique floral display.</p>
<p>The variety 'parviflorum' is distinguished by its smaller flowers compared to the typical form of Abutilon avicennae.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon avicennae f. parviflorum has ovate to elliptic leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth green upper surface and a slightly hairy underside, typically ranging in size from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light green to greyish bark that exhibits a creeping or trailing growth pattern. Its flowers are cup-shaped with five lobes, featuring a yellowish-green to pale orange color, blooming during the summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon avicennae f. parviflorum is a variant of the common velvetleaf, originally native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is now widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with warm climates and high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in disturbed habitats like roadsides, riverbanks, and cultivated fields. It typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its conservation status remains uncertain due to limited research and habitat degradation in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon avicennae f. parviflorum is a compact, ornamental shrub known for its soft, hairy leaves and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings offering faster and more reliable results. This plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 2 to 3 years, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it benefits from companion planting with herbs like rosemary or lavender.</p>
