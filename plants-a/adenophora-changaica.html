<p>Adenophora changaica, commonly known as the Korean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched.</p>
<p>Adenophora changaica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora changaica has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and somewhat woody at the base, with a light green to grayish-brown bark that has a rough texture. Its flowers are clustered in umbels, featuring five white to pale blue petals with a yellow center, blooming in summer and attracting insects through nectar, primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora changaica is primarily native to Mongolia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the southern and eastern parts. This plant thrives in rocky and semi-arid environments, often growing at higher elevations. It is part of the Asteraceae family and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional Mongolian medicine.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Mongolia, making it a regionally significant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora changaica was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, particularly in parts of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. This plant has been introduced to several countries including China, Korea, and Japan, where it thrives in naturalized habitats. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive blue to purple flowers.</p>
