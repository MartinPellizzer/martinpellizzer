<p>Amorpha rabiae, commonly known as the silky mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, compound leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in hard, woody pods that split open to release the seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Amorpha rabiae is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
