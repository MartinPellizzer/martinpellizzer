                <h1>Acranthera axilliflora</h1>
<p>Acranthera axilliflora, commonly known as the axillary-flowered acranthera, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands. The plant features slender stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a basal rosette.</p>
<p>Acranthera axilliflora is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera axilliflora has leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly woody, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes rougher with age. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, with tubular structures and a scent that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths, blooming primarily during the summer months. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the well-drained soils in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera axilliflora is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this region, particularly in the lowland and hill forest areas. The plant thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing along the forest floor or in undergrowth. It is known for its small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within Borneo.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera axilliflora was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen in open grasslands and fynbos habitats. It is known for its small, delicate flowers and is considered a valuable addition to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential impacts on native flora.</p>
