                <h1>Acnistus glabratus</h1>
<p>Acnistus glabratus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Acnistus glabratus is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spreading habit.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a notable plant in both ecological and agricultural contexts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus glabratus has simple, ovate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that is somewhat woody in texture. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus glabratus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist lowland forests and along riverbanks. The plant is also present in parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia. It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus glabratus was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several states including Alabama, Georgia, and Texas. The plant is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, waste areas, and along waterways. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions have contributed to its spread.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in many regions where it has established itself.</p>
