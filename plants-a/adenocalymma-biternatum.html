                <h1>Adenocalymma biternatum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma biternatum, commonly known as the three-leaved adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, palmate leaves with three leaflets. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma biternatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma biternatum has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being elliptical in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and varying in size from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that has a slightly rough texture, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<p>This plant is commonly found in the Andean regions of these countries. It typically grows in dry to semi-arid environments, often in rocky or disturbed soils. Adenocalymma biternatum is known for its unique morphology and is adapted to the diverse climates of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma biternatum was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dunes and heathlands. The plant is known for its striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring. It is commonly cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
