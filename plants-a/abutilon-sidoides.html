<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon sidoides is primarily native to South America, specifically ranging from northern Argentina to southern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the subtropical and tropical regions of these countries. This plant thrives in areas with warm, humid climates and is often associated with disturbed soils and open habitats. It is also present in parts of Uruguay and Paraguay.</p>
<p>Abutilon sidoides is typically found in lowland areas and is adapted to a variety of soil types.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon sidoides was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. This plant has been introduced to several countries in the Americas, including parts of Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico.
