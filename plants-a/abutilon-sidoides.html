<p>Abutilon sidoides, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its rough, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous bark and woody structure make it well adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Abutilon sidoides is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
