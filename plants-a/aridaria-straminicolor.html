                    <h1>Aridaria straminicolor</h1>
<p>Aridaria straminicolor, commonly known as the green flame plant, is a succulent native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the rainy season, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, powdery coating that reflects sunlight and reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Aridaria straminicolor is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
