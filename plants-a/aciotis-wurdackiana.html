                <h1>Aciotis wurdackiana</h1>
<p>Aciotis wurdackiana, commonly known as the Wurdack's aciotis, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. It features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis wurdackiana has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a light green color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are yellow with a distinctive purple center, arranged in clusters, and bloom from late spring to early summer, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis wurdackiana is primarily native to Brazil North.</p>
<p>It is found in the northern regions of Brazil, particularly in the Amazon Basin. This plant thrives in humid tropical environments with rich, well-drained soils. It is commonly observed in moist forest understories and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to this specific geographic area within Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis wurdackiana was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and parts of Texas.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 20th century and has since spread to other regions within its native range. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in open habitats. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain areas.</p>
<p>Despite its spread, it remains a relatively minor weed compared to other introduced species in the region.</p>
