                    <h1>Alyssum doerfleri var. oetaeum</h1>
<p>Alyssum doerfleri var. oetaeum, commonly known as the Oetaean alpine alyssum, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit, with hairy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
