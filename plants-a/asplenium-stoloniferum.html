                    <h1>Asplenium stoloniferum</h1>
<p>Asplenium stoloniferum, commonly known as the wandering spleen, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit, with stolons that allow it to spread horizontally across the ground. The plant produces small, clustered fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Asplenium stoloniferum is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
