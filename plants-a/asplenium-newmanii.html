                    <h1>Asplenium newmanii</h1>
<p>Asplenium newmanii, commonly known as the Newman's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, and thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns.</p>
<p>Asplenium newmanii is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air.</p>
