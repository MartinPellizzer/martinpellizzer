                    <h1>Arceuthobium</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium, commonly known as the witch's butter, is a parasitic plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of conifers. The plant produces a gelatinous, yellowish fruit that is sticky and can adhere to the fur of animals or the feathers of birds. This method of dispersal allows the seeds to be transported to new host locations.</p>
<p>Due to its unique life cycle and limited distribution, Arceuthobium is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
