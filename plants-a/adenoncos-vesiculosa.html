                <h1>Adenoncos vesiculosa</h1>
<p>Adenoncos vesiculosa, commonly known as the bubblegum plant, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, fleshy stems that resemble inflated balloons, which store water and help it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate visual appeal. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Adenoncos vesiculosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenoncos vesiculosa has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside; the leaves are typically 2â€“5 cm long and arranged along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a pale green to reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoncos vesiculosa is primarily native to Malaya, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soils. Adenoncos vesiculosa is often associated with lowland forests and secondary growth areas.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the ecological conditions of Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoncos vesiculosa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high sunlight exposure and well-drained soils. The plant spreads primarily through seed dispersal, often aided by wind and animal activity. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a potential invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation, altering local ecosystems.</p>
