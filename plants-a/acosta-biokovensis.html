                <h1>Acosta biokovensis</h1>
<p>Acosta biokovensis, commonly known as the Biokov endemic, is a rare flowering plant native to the Biokovo Mountains in Croatia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing bright yellow ray florets surrounded by tight, greenish-brown disk florets. It thrives in calcareous soils and is adapted to the humid, temperate climate of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta biokovensis has leaves that are oval-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green color and a slightly rough upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta biokovensis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central Chile.</p>
<p>It is found in the Andean foothills, specifically in the area surrounding the Biokovo Mountains. This plant thrives in rocky and semi-arid environments at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. It is commonly found in dry slopes and gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta biokovensis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with a temperate climate, particularly in regions of Central and Eastern Europe. This plant has been introduced to several countries in the Balkans and parts of Southern Germany. It is often cultivated in gardens and parks due to its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
