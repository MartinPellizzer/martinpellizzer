<p>Aconitum toxicum subsp.</p>
<p>lasiocarpum, commonly known as the woolly-fruited aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely foliated stem and large, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant produces distinctive, hairy, and often woody fruits known as capsules, which contain the toxic seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Like other members of the genus Aconitum, it contains potent alkaloids that make it highly poisonous to both humans and animals.</p>
