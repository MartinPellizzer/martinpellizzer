                    <h1>Astragalus griseosericeus</h1>
<p>Astragalus griseosericeus, commonly known as the gray-hair milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has finely hairy, grayish-green foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, hard pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>Astragalus griseosericeus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to low-nutrient conditions.</p>
