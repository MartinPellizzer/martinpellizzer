                    <h1>Aegilops lorentii</h1>
<p>Aegilops lorentii, commonly known as the wild einkorn wheat relative, is a diploid grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the tribe Aegilopineae within the family Poaceae and is closely related to cultivated wheat species. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets that contain small, hard seeds. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable species for genetic research.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to wheat, it is often studied for its potential contributions to crop improvement and stress tolerance.</p>
