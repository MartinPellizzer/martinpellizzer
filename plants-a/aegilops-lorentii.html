                <h1>Aegilops lorentii</h1>
<p>Aegilops lorentii, commonly known as the wild einkorn wheat relative, is a diploid grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the tribe Aegilopineae within the family Poaceae and is closely related to cultivated wheat species. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets that contain small, hard seeds. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable species for genetic research.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to wheat, it is often studied for its potential contributions to crop improvement and stress tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops lorentii has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and have a bluish-green color with a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is mostly erect. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which bloom in early summer and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, three-angled spikelet containing three seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
