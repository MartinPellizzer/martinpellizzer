                <h1>Achillea × romanica</h1>
<p>Achillea × romanica, commonly known as the Roman or garden yarrow, is a hybrid perennial plant in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and flat, clustered flower heads that range in color from white to pink. The plant is native to southern Europe and thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is often used in garden landscapes for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Its common name honors the legendary Greek hero Achilles, who was said to have used the plant to treat wounds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × romanica has narrow, gray-green, fern-like leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5–15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, herbaceous, and covered with fine hairs, exhibiting a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a clumping manner. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × romanica is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans, particularly in countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends to parts of southern Europe, including Italy and Austria, where it is often found in disturbed or semi-natural habitats. This plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is typically found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its limited distribution and habitat specificity make it a species of conservation interest in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea × romanica is a hardy perennial known for its fluffy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seeds sown in late summer. This plant has a long growth cycle, typically thriving for several years before needing division.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering. Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and vigor. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or coneflower can enhance its appearance and promote beneficial insect activity.</p>
