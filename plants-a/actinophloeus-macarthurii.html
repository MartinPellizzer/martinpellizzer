                <h1>Actinophloeus macarthurii</h1>
<p>Actinophloeus macarthurii, commonly known as the Macarthur's ironwood, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and evergreen foliage, which contribute to its structural strength and aesthetic appeal. The plant typically grows in humid, lowland forests and thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in yellow or green hues, while its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its durability and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated for timber and as a landscape plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus macarthurii has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin, vertical strips. Its small, clustered flowers are yellow with five petals, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus macarthurii is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. This plant thrives in humid environments with well-drained soils, often growing in secondary forests and along riverbanks. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and New Guinea.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with regions that have a warm climate and high rainfall throughout the year.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus macarthurii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as part of efforts to establish a diverse range of plant species for horticultural and ornamental purposes. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in coastal and subcoastal areas, often found growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to spread and compete with native flora in these ecosystems.</p>
