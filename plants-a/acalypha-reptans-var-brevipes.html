<p>It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers. The plant is characterized by its stinging hairs, which can cause a painful reaction upon contact with the skin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and a branching stem covered in fine, glandular hairs.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha reptans var. brevipes has ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 2â€“5 cm long, arranged oppositely along the stem, and have a bright green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, creeping, and often prostrate, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly woody with age. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with greenish-white bracts that enclose the tiny, inconspicuous flowers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-lobed, three-chambered capsule that disperses seeds by wind when it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>
