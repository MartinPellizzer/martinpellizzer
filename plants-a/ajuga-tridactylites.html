                    <h1>Ajuga tridactylites</h1>
<p>Ajuga tridactylites, commonly known as carpet bugle or ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a dense mat of dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed.</p>
