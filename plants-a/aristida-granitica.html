                    <h1>Aristida granitica</h1>
<p>Aristida granitica, commonly known as the granite dropseed, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils, particularly on rocky or gravelly substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is often used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens.</p>
