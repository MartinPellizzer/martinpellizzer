                <h1>Acer pinnatinervium</h1>
<p>Acer pinnatinervium, commonly known as the golden maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow leaves that turn red in the fall, making it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has a rounded crown and can grow up to 20 meters tall, with smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, inconspicuous flowers appear in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>The leaves are pinnately veined and have a delicate, lobed appearance, contributing to its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pinnatinervium has leaves that are palmately lobed, with a delicate, finely serrated edge, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length; they are usually a vibrant green during the growing season and turn striking shades of red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight, upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed capsule that disperses by wind, allowing the seeds to travel several meters from the parent plant.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils and providing stability to the plant.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pinnatinervium is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is primarily confined to these areas, with some records extending into northern Vietnam. It thrives in moist, temperate forests and rocky slopes, often found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Acer pinnatinervium is classified as a vulnerable species by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pinnatinervium is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer pinnatinervium includes a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support biodiversity in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pinnatinervium is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil structure and promoting the growth of other native species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and supporting a diverse range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pinnatinervium is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal infusions.</p>
<p>It has been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, though scientific validation is still pending. In terms of industrial applications, it is not widely utilized, but its wood could potentially be used for small-scale woodworking or crafts. Culturally, it holds significance in certain regions of its native habitat, where it may be symbolically associated with local traditions or natural landscapes.</p>
<p>Overall, its role remains largely ecological and ornamental, with further research needed to fully explore its potential applications.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pinnatinervium has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Aureum' with its golden foliage and 'Variegatum' featuring striking variegated leaves.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, such as Acer circinatum, to produce cultivars with enhanced cold hardiness and unique leaf patterns. These hybrids often exhibit improved adaptability to different climates, making them popular choices for horticultural use. The plant's diverse forms contribute significantly to the landscape design industry, especially in regions with temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its aesthetic appeal and horticultural versatility have made it a favored species among gardeners and landscapers.</p>
