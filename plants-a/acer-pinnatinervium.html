                <h1>Acer pinnatinervium</h1>
<p>Acer pinnatinervium, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its alternate, pinnately compound leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“25 meters and thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pinnatinervium has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elongated leaflets that are typically oval or lance-shaped, measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement, and they change color from bright green in summer to vibrant red or orange in autumn. The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>Its fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pinnatinervium is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, primarily found in countries such as Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely restricted to its native range due to habitat loss and limited cultivation. This plant thrives in humid, tropical montane forests, often growing in shaded, moist environments. It is typically found at altitudes between 800 and 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and threats from deforestation, Acer pinnatinervium is listed as endangered in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pinnatinervium is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves rapid growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot, and it pairs well with other shade-loving plants in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pinnatinervium is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape and reducing runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer pinnatinervium plays a role in improving soil quality by enhancing nutrient cycling in the environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pinnatinervium is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use but is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>It has been used in some indigenous cultures for treating respiratory and skin conditions. While not widely cultivated for industrial purposes, its wood is occasionally used for small crafts and decorative items. The plant holds cultural significance in certain regions, where it is symbolized as a sign of resilience and adaptability.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications are more niche compared to other maple species, but it contributes to local biodiversity and ecological studies.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pinnatinervium has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aureum', known for its striking yellow leaves, and 'Variegatum', which features variegated foliage. Hybrids of Acer pinnatinervium are often created to enhance traits such as color, form, and cold hardiness. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions.</p>
<p>They are widely used in landscaping and as ornamental trees in temperate climates.</p>
