                    <h1>Aspidium cicutarium var. angustius</h1>
<p>Aspidium cicutarium var. angustius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in temperate regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
