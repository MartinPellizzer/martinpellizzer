                <h1>Achyranthes corymbosa</h1>
<p>Achyranthes corymbosa, commonly known as the Indian mallow, is a flowering plant native to Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other well-known species like cotton and hibiscus. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, open habitats.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots and hairy stems are notable botanical features.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes corymbosa has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a brownish-gray bark that becomes more rugged with age, growing upright with branching. The flowers are small, clustered in corymbs, with pale green to yellowish petals, blooming in summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes corymbosa is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along riverbanks. The plant is commonly distributed in the Indian subcontinent, particularly in the eastern and southern parts of India. It also occurs in parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its native range extends to some areas of Africa, though it is less commonly found there compared to its Asian distribution.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes corymbosa was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along waterways. The plant is often spread through seeds that are dispersed by water, wind, or human activity. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in some ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is important to monitor its distribution to prevent ecological imbalances in native habitats.</p>
