                <h1>Achyranthes corymbosa</h1>
<p>Achyranthes corymbosa, commonly known as the Indian cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to South and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring erect stems and lanceolate leaves with rough textures. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its fruit is a spiny capsule that contains several seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Achyranthes corymbosa is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes corymbosa has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, typically measuring 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and they grow in clusters or as single stems. The flowers are small, clustered in corymbs, with white or pale pink petals, blooming from July to September, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind once it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes corymbosa is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Its current distribution has expanded to include parts of Africa, the Caribbean, and tropical regions of the Americas, often due to human introduction. It thrives in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks, swampy areas, and degraded forests. This species typically grows at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to about 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>It is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, although local populations may be affected by habitat loss and land use changes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achyranthes corymbosa is a hardy annual plant known for its vibrant yellow flowers and rapid growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds sown directly in the garden or started indoors 4-6 weeks before the last frost. The growth cycle begins with germination in spring, followed by rapid vegetative growth and flowering in late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to encourage bushier growth can enhance its appearance. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>
