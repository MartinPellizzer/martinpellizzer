<p>Arida blepharophylla, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, leaf-like structures that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are often translucent, giving it a ghostly appearance, which contributes to its common name.</p>
<p>Arida blepharophylla is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
