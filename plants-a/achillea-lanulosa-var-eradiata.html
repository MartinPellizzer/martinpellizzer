                <h1>Achillea lanulosa var. eradiata</h1>
<p>Achillea lanulosa var. eradiata, commonly known as the woolly yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its foliage. Its leaves are grayish-green and covered in a fine layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in rock gardens and xeriscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea lanulosa var. eradiata has leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 3 to 10 cm in length, with a grayish-white or silvery underside due to dense pubescence.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat hairy, with a light green color, and exhibits a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of yellow to orange tubular florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea lanulosa var. eradiata is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes regions such as southern France, Italy, Spain, and the Iberian Peninsula, where it thrives in specific ecological niches. This plant prefers sunny, well-drained soils and is commonly found in rocky or gravelly habitats. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea lanulosa var. eradiata is a hardy perennial known for its fluffy, yellowish-white flowers and drought-resistant nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a long growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and maintaining a compact form throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, preferring full sun to partial shade. Fertilization should be light in spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea lanulosa var. eradiata is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. This plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its beneficial properties. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it supports biodiversity by offering ecological benefits that sustain a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea lanulosa var. eradiata is a lesser-known member of the Asteraceae family, primarily valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens due to its fluffy, white flower heads.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it may occasionally be included in herbal teas or infusions for its mild aromatic properties. In traditional medicine, it has been used in some regions for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties, though scientific validation remains limited. Its role in industrial applications is minimal, but it contributes to biodiversity and ecological balance in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in local traditions, though specific meanings are not well documented.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea lanulosa var. eradiata has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, including 'Pink Frost' and 'White Cloud,' which are known for their delicate, fluffy flowers and silver foliage.</p>
<p>This variety is often hybridized with other Achillea species to create plants with enhanced hardiness, extended bloom periods, and improved coloration. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions and its role in attracting pollinators like butterflies and bees. It is commonly used in garden borders, rock gardens, and as a companion plant in perennial beds.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability, it remains a favored choice among landscape designers and home gardeners.</p>
