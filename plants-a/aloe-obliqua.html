                    <h1>Aloe obliqua</h1>
<p>Aloe obliqua, commonly known as the mountain aloe, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick, fleshy, and covered in a whitish powdery coating called farina. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is used in traditional medicine and skincare products.</p>
<p>Aloe obliqua is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its leaves and reducing transpiration through its waxy surface.</p>
