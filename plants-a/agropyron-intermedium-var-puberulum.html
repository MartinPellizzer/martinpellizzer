<p>Agropyron intermedium var. puberulum, commonly known as the silky wheatgrasses, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control.</p>
