<p>Acacia chisholmii, commonly known as the Chisholm's wattle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Acacia chisholmii is adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
