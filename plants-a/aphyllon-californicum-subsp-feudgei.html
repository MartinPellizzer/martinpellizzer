<p>Aphyllon californicum subsp.</p>
<p>feudgei, commonly known as the Feudge's leafless buckwheat, is a rare flowering plant native to California. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only small, scale-like structures present.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
