<p>Arctium minus subsp.</p>
<p>tibidatensis, commonly known as the Tibetan burdock, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a robust taproot and hairy, lobed leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of small, purple flowers in late summer. Its fruit is a bur-like schizocarp with hooked bracts that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found in alpine and rocky habitats.</p>
