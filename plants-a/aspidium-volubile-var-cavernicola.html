<p>Aspidium volubile var. cavernicola, commonly known as the cave fern, is a variant of the common rock fern.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in caves or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, frond-like leaves that are usually curled or coiled when young. Its rhizomes are often thick and creeping, allowing it to spread along the ground or rock surfaces.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its unique adaptation to subterranean habitats.</p>
