<p>Arachnorchis longicauda subsp.</p>
<p>redacta, commonly known as the Red-tailed Spider Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown sepals and petals, which give it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open forests or heathlands. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are adapted for pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
