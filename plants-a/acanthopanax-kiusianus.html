<p>Acanthopanax kiusianus, commonly known as the Korean angel's trumpet, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Korea and parts of eastern Russia.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with elongated, serrated leaflets and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. The plant is characterized by its woody, branched stems and is often found in forest understories. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Acanthopanax kiusianus is relatively hardy and adaptable to a variety of soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax kiusianus has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate leaflets that are typically 3–5 cm in length, dark green on top, and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters during late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and the seeds are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and serve as an anchor, also helping the plant absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax kiusianus is a plant native to the Korean Peninsula, including parts of South Korea, North Korea, and northeastern China.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes regions in Japan, particularly Honshu and Hokkaido, as well as some areas in Russia. It thrives in moist, temperate forests and mountainous regions, often growing in shaded undergrowth. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is listed as a vulnerable species in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax kiusianus is a hardy shrub known for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 3–5 years, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering.</p>
<p>Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, requiring careful monitoring.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax kiusianus is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting soil stability. Its dense growth also helps prevent soil erosion in forested areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>
