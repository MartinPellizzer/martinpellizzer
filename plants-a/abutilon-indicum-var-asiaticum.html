                <h1>Abutilon indicum var. asiaticum</h1>
<p>Abutilon indicum var. asiaticum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Indian abutilon, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive, velvety appearance, and it is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to partial shade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon indicum var. asiaticum has heart-shaped leaves that are velvety in texture, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are pendulous, with five pale yellow petals and a prominent red calyx, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon indicum var. asiaticum is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and southern China.</p>
<p>It is now found in various parts of South and Southeast Asia, including India, Nepal, and the Philippines. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in moist, well-drained soils near rivers or in forested areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, it is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, though habitat loss poses a potential threat to its populations.</p>
