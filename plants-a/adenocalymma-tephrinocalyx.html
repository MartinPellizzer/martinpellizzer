                <h1>Adenocalymma tephrinocalyx</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma tephrinocalyx, commonly known as the mountain bottle tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive bottle-shaped trunk and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from underground sources.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to semi-arid and rocky habitats, making it a resilient and ornamental plant in suitable climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma tephrinocalyx has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5–8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma tephrinocalyx is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the southeastern region of Brazil, including states such as São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical environments within this area. The species is adapted to the humid and warm climate of the region.</p>
<p>It is often found in forested areas and along riverbanks.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma tephrinocalyx was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, waste areas, and degraded forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in parts of South America. Its introduction is associated with human activities, including land clearing and transportation corridors.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
