                <h1>Acer matsumurae</h1>
<p>Acer matsumurae, commonly known as the Japanese maple or Matsumura maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is known for its ornamental value in gardens. It typically grows to a height of 4â€“8 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, greenish-yellow catkins, and the tree is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer matsumurae has palmate leaves that are typically 5-7 lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that disperse by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its natural habitat in rocky or mountainous areas.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer matsumurae is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to specific areas within this region, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. The plant typically grows in shaded, forested environments at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acer matsumurae is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer matsumurae is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its striking foliage and slow growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer matsumurae is slow, with new growth appearing in spring and leaves turning vibrant colors in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires consistent watering during the growing season, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with light feeding in spring, and pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving perennials or ferns can enhance its ornamental display in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer matsumurae is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration, offering long-term ecological benefits to the environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer matsumurae is a rare flowering tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its flowers and leaves may have limited use in traditional herbal remedies. The tree's wood is not widely utilized industrially due to its scarcity and limited availability. In cultural contexts, it holds symbolic meaning in local traditions and may be appreciated for its aesthetic appeal in landscaping.</p>
<p>Its role in biodiversity and as a subject of botanical study contributes to its ecological and scientific importance.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer matsumurae has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Atropurpureum' and 'Variegatum', which are known for their striking foliage colors. The species is often used in hybridization to enhance traits such as fall color and cold hardiness. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to add unique visual appeal to gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its beauty and adaptability, Acer matsumurae remains a sought-after plant in the horticultural trade.</p>
