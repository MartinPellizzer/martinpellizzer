                <h1>Acer matsumurae</h1>
<p>Acer matsumurae, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental value due to its vibrant autumn foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 6â€“10 meters, with a spreading canopy and palmately lobed leaves. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and appear in clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Acer matsumurae thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer matsumurae has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in panicles, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in forest understory environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer matsumurae is a rare species of maple native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, specifically in provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to these areas, where it grows in isolated populations. The plant thrives in temperate forests with high humidity and moderate rainfall, typically found in shaded, moist environments. It is usually found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Acer matsumurae is listed as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer matsumurae is a unique maple species known for its ornamental value and slow growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer matsumurae is typically slow, with new growth appearing in early spring and foliage turning vibrant colors in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications in spring, and pruning is recommended to maintain shape and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or fungal infections.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving plants like ferns or heathers can enhance its growth in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer matsumurae is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. Its dense foliage acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species in the forest understory. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil and prevents runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by shedding leaves that decompose and enrich the forest floor.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer matsumurae is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use but is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>It is primarily used in ornamental horticulture due to its unique foliage and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes. While it does not have significant industrial applications, its presence in certain regions contributes to local biodiversity and ecological research. In cultural contexts, it may hold symbolic value in local communities, though specific meanings are not widely documented.</p>
<p>Overall, its role is more ecological and ornamental than commercial or medicinal.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer matsumurae has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are appreciated for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Orange Glow' and 'Sutherlandii', which are known for their vibrant fall colors and unique foliage. Hybrids of Acer matsumurae are often developed to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and disease resistance. These cultivars and hybrids play a significant role in horticulture, particularly in landscaping and garden design.</p>
<p>Their aesthetic appeal and adaptability make them valuable additions to diverse planting environments.</p>
