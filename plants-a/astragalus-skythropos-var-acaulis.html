                    <h1>Astragalus skythropos var. acaulis</h1>
<p>Astragalus skythropos var. acaulis, commonly known as the barrenstem milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often leafless stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or pale pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deep within the soil.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations.</p>
