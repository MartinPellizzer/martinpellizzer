                <h1>Adiantum scabrum</h1>
<p>Adiantum scabrum, commonly known as the rough maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in fine, scaly structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces.</p>
<p>Adiantum scabrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant, lace-like appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum scabrum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, finely serrated edge and a pale green color.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and wiry with a smooth, pale brown bark. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spore-bearing structures called sorus, typically found on the underside of the leaves, and they are pollinated by wind. The plant does not produce true fruits or seeds; instead, it reproduces via spores released from the sorus, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum scabrum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments. This fern thrives in humid climates and is often associated with forest understories. It is also present in parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to wet, rocky soils and can be found in stream banks and mountainous areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum scabrum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. This fern has become naturalized in several areas, often spreading through spore dispersal. Its introduction is likely due to both intentional cultivation and accidental spread through human activity.</p>
<p>It is considered a non-native species that has established itself in local ecosystems.</p>
