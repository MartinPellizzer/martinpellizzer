                <h1>Acineta densa</h1>
<p>Acineta densa, commonly known as the dense acineta, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Acineta densa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acineta densa has small, ovate leaves that are densely packed, arranged in a basal rosette, and range in size from 1 to 3 centimeters in length, with a dark green coloration.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a rough, bark-like texture and a reddish-brown color, growing in a compact, upright form. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with four petals, typically in shades of pink or white, blooming during the spring and summer months, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acineta densa is primarily native to Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Panam√°.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in the tropical regions of these countries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories. The plant is well adapted to the warm and moist climate of Central America.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its preference for tropical and subtropical habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acineta densa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, particularly in the North Island. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with dune environments. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its ability to spread rapidly.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities.</p>
