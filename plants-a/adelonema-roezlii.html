                <h1>Adelonema roezlii</h1>
<p>Adelonema roezlii, commonly known as the Zambian orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Adelonema roezlii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, humid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelonema roezlii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, blooming in early spring, and is pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its natural habitat in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelonema roezlii is primarily native to Colombia.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the Andean foothills and lowland areas. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within its native habitat. It is commonly found in cloud forests and secondary growth areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within Colombia's diverse ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelonema roezlii was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates, particularly in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments where there is ample sunlight and well-drained soil. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. It has been reported in several countries, including Australia and the Philippines, as an introduced species.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems remains under study.</p>
