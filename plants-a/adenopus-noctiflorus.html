                <h1>Adenopus noctiflorus</h1>
<p>Adenopus noctiflorus, commonly known as the night-flowering moonflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night and close by morning. The plant belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is known for its fragrant, tubular petals. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>Adenopus noctiflorus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its unique nocturnal blooming habit.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenopus noctiflorus has compound leaves that are pinnate, with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, vertical strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals that open at night, and they are pollinated by moths through a process of nocturnal pollination. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and enabling the plant to thrive in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopus noctiflorus is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within rainforests and along riverbanks. This species is commonly found in the eastern and southern parts of the continent. It prefers well-drained soils and is often associated with secondary growth areas.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to specific ecological zones where it plays a role in local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopus noctiflorus was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates where it can thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and along riverbanks. The plant is known for its nocturnal flowering, producing fragrant white blooms that attract night-active pollinators. Its introduction has led to its spread in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential remains a topic of debate among ecologists.</p>
