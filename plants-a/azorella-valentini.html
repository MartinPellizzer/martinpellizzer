                    <h1>Azorella valentini</h1>
<p>Azorella valentini, commonly known as the Valenti's azorella, is a rare and unique member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, specifically in Chile and Argentina. The plant is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in cold and arid environments. Its leaves are typically small, dark green, and covered in a thick layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Azorella valentini is also notable for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, enhancing its nutrient absorption in poor soils.</p>
