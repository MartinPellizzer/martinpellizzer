                <h1>Actinodaphne diversifolia</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne diversifolia, commonly known as the variable-leaf camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive white underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, globose drupe containing a single seed.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its essential oils and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne diversifolia has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a pale grey bark that peels in thin strips, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in panicles, featuring yellowish-green petals and stamens, and bloom during the dry season, likely pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne diversifolia is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. It thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and well-drained soil. The plant is often encountered in secondary growth and along riverine forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the western and eastern regions of Borneo.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne diversifolia was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with humid climates and well-drained soil, such as parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of the Americas. The plant thrives in shaded to partially sunny conditions and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been increasingly distributed in areas where it can establish itself easily.</p>
