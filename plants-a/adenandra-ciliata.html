                <h1>Adenandra ciliata</h1>
<p>Adenandra ciliata, commonly known as the silky adenandra, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Adenandra ciliata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra ciliata has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough and fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, with five petals and a prominent central stamen, blooming in spring and summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra ciliata is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland regions, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. This plant thrives in areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It is typically found in shrublands and along the edges of forests.</p>
<p>Adenandra ciliata is well adapted to the environmental conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra ciliata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. The species has since become naturalized in several regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, particularly in the North Island.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered a major threat to native ecosystems.</p>
