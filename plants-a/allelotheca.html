                    <h1>Allelotheca</h1>
<p>Allelotheca, commonly known as the "false broomrape," is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, often attaching itself to the roots of other species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale in color. Its life cycle is highly dependent on the presence of specific host plants, making it a challenging species to study.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host.</p>
