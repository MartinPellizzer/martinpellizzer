                <h1>Adonis barthei</h1>
<p>Adonis barthei, commonly known as the Persian buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in alpine or steppe habitats.</p>
<p>Adonis barthei is valued for its ornamental beauty and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis barthei has leaves that are basal, lance-shaped, and bright green, with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly woody, growing in a rosette pattern. The flowers are large, showy, and yellow with a red stripe, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis barthei is primarily native to the eastern Mediterranean region, including parts of Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel.</p>
<p>It is also found in areas of southern Europe, such as Greece and the Balkans. This plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in open habitats like grasslands and shrublands. It is well adapted to dry and sunny conditions, often thriving in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its historical presence in these specific ecological zones across the Mediterranean basin.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis barthei was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal have led to concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems. Despite its beauty, it is considered a potential environmental weed in some areas.</p>
<p>Monitoring its distribution and impact remains important for ecological management.</p>
