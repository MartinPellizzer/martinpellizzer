<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha stipularis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and upright, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green, with male and female flowers on separate plants, and bloom from spring to early summer, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha stipularis is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends to parts of Oceania and the Pacific Islands, where it has been introduced as an ornamental plant. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in disturbed soils near coastal areas or in open woodlands. It typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Acalypha stipularis is currently not considered threatened, but its introduction to new regions may pose ecological risks if it becomes invasive.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha stipularis is a fast-growing, ornamental shrub known for its vibrant foliage and ability to thrive in various climates.</p>
