                <h1>Acourtia montana</h1>
<p>Acourtia montana, commonly known as the mountain acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in mountainous regions, preferring full sun exposure. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range from white to pinkish in color.</p>
<p>Acourtia montana is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia montana has leaves that are narrow, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and covered with fine hairs, displaying a grayish-green color and growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's arid habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia montana is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and coastal areas, often growing in dry, sunny environments. This plant is typically associated with serpentine soils, which are characterized by high levels of heavy metals. It thrives in regions with mild, temperate climates and is often seen in coastal bluffs and hillsides.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Acourtia montana is relatively rare and has a limited geographic range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia montana was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal dunes and sandy soils along the Pacific coast. This plant has been documented in several protected areas and natural reserves due to its ecological significance. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to monitor and manage its spread.</p>
