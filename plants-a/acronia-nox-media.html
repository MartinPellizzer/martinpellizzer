                <h1>Acronia nox-media</h1>
<p>Acronia nox-media, commonly known as the night-flowering acronia, is a unique species of flowering plant characterized by its nocturnal blooming habit.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is native to specific regions in South America. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that open at night, attracting pollinators such as moths and bats. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant's adaptation to low-light conditions makes it an intriguing subject for botanical study.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia nox-media has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, white flowers are clustered in terminal spikes, blooming at night during the summer months, and are pollinated by moths attracted to their nocturnal nectar. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia nox-media is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically occurring in parts of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils within forested areas and along stream banks. This plant is commonly found in wetland habitats and is adapted to the humid climate of the region. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and specialized plant in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia nox-media was mainly introduced to the western United States as an ornamental plant due to its unique nocturnal blooming habit.</p>
<p>It was first documented in California in the late 19th century and has since spread to other states like Oregon and Washington. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is considered a non-native species with limited ecological impact in its introduced range.</p>
