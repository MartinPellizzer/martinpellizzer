<p>Anychiastrum, commonly known as the desert willow, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its slender, often twining stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and opposite, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Anychiastrum species produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging desert conditions.</p>
