                <h1>Acrostemon thunbergii</h1>
<p>Acrostemon thunbergii, commonly known as the white-eyed ginger, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes gingers and turmeric. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers with prominent red stamens. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Acrostemon thunbergii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostemon thunbergii has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slightly hairy, and has a light green bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals with a yellow center, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostemon thunbergii is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in wetlands and along the edges of water bodies. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with marshy or swampy habitats. It is also present in parts of the Philippines and southern China.</p>
<p>Acrostemon thunbergii is well adapted to moist soil conditions and plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostemon thunbergii was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several countries across Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Africa. The plant's ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its rapid growth rate contribute to its spread. It is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to prevent its further expansion into sensitive ecosystems.</p>
