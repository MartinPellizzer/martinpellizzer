                    <h1>Ananas comosus var. tricolor</h1>
<p>Ananas comosus var. tricolor, commonly known as the rainbow pineapple, is a tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a variant of the pineapple that features three distinct color bands on its fruit—typically red, yellow, and green—creating a striking visual effect. The plant produces a spiky, leafy crown at the top of the fruit, which is characteristic of the pineapple family. Its leaves are long, sword-shaped, and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment.</p>
<p>The fruit develops from the central core of the plant and is harvested when the leaves begin to yellow and the fruit reaches full size.</p>
