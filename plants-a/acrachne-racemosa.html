                <h1>Acrachne racemosa</h1>
<p>Acrachne racemosa, commonly known as the clustered acanthus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, clustered inflorescences. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and vibrant blue or purple flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Acrachne racemosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrachne racemosa has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a light green to brownish color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemose inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out underground, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrachne racemosa is primarily native to Afghanistan, Angola, Bangladesh, Botswana, Cape Verde, Chad, China South-Central, DR Congo, East Himalaya, Eritrea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Hainan, India, Kenya, Lesser Sunda Is., Malawi, Malaya, Mali, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Niger, Northern Provinces, Northern Territory, Oman, Pakistan, Queensland, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Socotra, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan-South Sudan, Tanzania, Thailand, Vietnam, West Himalaya, Western Australia, Yemen, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is widely distributed across these regions, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is commonly seen in open woodlands and grasslands. Its native range spans multiple continents, including Asia, Africa, and Australia.</p>
<p>Acrachne racemosa is an important component of the flora in these regions, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrachne racemosa was mainly introduced to California, Dominican Republic, Egypt, and Haiti.</p>
<p>It has become established in these regions, likely due to human activities such as trade or accidental transport. The plant is now found in various habitats, including disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Further study is needed to assess its ecological effects in these areas.</p>
