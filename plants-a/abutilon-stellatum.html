                        <h1>Abutilon stellatum</h1>
<p>Abutilon stellatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds.</p>
<p>Abutilon stellatum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon stellatum is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, including parts of California, Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. This plant thrives in rocky soils and can often be seen growing along canyon walls and in desert scrub habitats. It is also present in areas of Baja California and the Mexican state of Sonora.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon stellatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats, including disturbed soils and along roadsides. It is considered an invasive species in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
