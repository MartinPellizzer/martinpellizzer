                    <h1>Agrostis alpina</h1>
<p>Agrostis alpina, commonly known as alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in width. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to golden flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Agrostis alpina thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
