                <h1>Aeluropus longispicatus</h1>
<p>Aeluropus longispicatus, commonly known as the long-bristled grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Aeluropus longispicatus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeluropus longispicatus has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically flat, linear, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light green surface, and grows in dense clumps or tufts, often close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that are usually pale green or brown, blooming during the summer months.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, three-angled capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize sandy or coastal soils.</p>
