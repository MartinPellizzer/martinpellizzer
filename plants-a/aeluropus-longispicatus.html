                    <h1>Aeluropus longispicatus</h1>
<p>Aeluropus longispicatus, commonly known as the long-bristled grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Aeluropus longispicatus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert organisms.</p>
