                    <h1>Afrotrilepis</h1>
<p>Afrotrilepis, commonly known as the African broomrape, is a parasitic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a fibrous, root-like structure called a haustorium that attaches to the roots of its host. Afrotrilepis is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique parasitic lifestyle and ecological interactions within its native habitat.</p>
