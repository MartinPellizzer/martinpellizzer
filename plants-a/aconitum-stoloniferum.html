                <h1>Aconitum stoloniferum</h1>
<p>Aconitum stoloniferum, commonly known as the creeping aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafy stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple bell-shaped flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Aconitum stoloniferum is known for its toxic properties, containing potent alkaloids that make it dangerous to both humans and animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum stoloniferum has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter beneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, often hairy, with a rough, dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and clustered in racemes, blooming in summer and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through a slit, dispersing them by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, anchoring the plant and storing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum stoloniferum is primarily native to the Primorye region.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the wild within the temperate climate zones of Primorye. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forests and mountainous regions. The species is well adapted to the unique ecological conditions of this area.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the specific habitats within Primorye.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum stoloniferum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue to purple flowers and tall, elegant growth habit. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and spreads through both seeds and rhizomes.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt natural habitats.</p>
