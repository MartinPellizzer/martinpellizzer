                <h1>Acalypha decidua</h1>
<p>Acalypha decidua, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots enable it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>Acalypha decidua is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha decidua has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a spreading or shrub-like pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or red, with five petals and stamens, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha decidua is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya.</p>
<p>It is now found in parts of southern Arabia and the Horn of Africa, with some populations extending into the Arabian Peninsula. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, Acalypha decidua is listed as a vulnerable species in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
