                    <h1>Aspidium aequatoriense</h1>
<p>Aspidium aequatoriense, commonly known as the Ecuadorian shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomorphs, which help in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
