                        <h1>Acalypha spachiana</h1>
<p>Acalypha spachiana, commonly known as the red-hot catshrub, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1â€“3 meters. The plant is characterized by its striking red bracts that surround small yellow flowers, creating a visually appealing display. Its leaves are usually ovate or elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Acalypha spachiana thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha spachiana belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their primitive features and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many primitive angiosperms with a wide range of morphological diversity.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes species with diverse adaptations, such as those found in tropical and temperate regions. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with distinctive flowers and often produces toxic compounds. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants known for their showy bracts and often used in ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha spachiana, a specific plant within the genus Acalypha, characterized by its unique morphological traits and ecological preferences.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha spachiana is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the diverse ecosystems of this island nation, which is known for its unique and endemic flora. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid and shaded environments. It is commonly observed in forested areas and along stream sides.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species within Madagascar's botanical heritage.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha spachiana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was brought there in the late 19th or early 20th century by horticulturalists seeking to diversify local plant collections. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become naturalized and is now considered invasive in some areas. The plant spreads rapidly through seed dispersal, often outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native ornamental species.</p>
