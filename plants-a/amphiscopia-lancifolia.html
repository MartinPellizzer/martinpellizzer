<p>Amphiscopia lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
