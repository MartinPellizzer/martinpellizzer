                <h1>Acourtia wislizeni</h1>
<p>Acourtia wislizeni, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a purple or red tinge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a tall flowering stalk that can reach up to 3 feet in height. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Acourtia wislizeni is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia wislizeni has leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and grows upright, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that is smooth and somewhat fibrous. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense spikes, blooming from spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses seeds by wind, with each seed being minute and winged for aerial transport.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia wislizeni is primarily native to Mexico Central, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Northwest, and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in rocky soils and is often associated with desert scrub habitats. Acourtia wislizeni is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific geographic regions within Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia wislizeni was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. This plant has been noted for its ability to thrive in arid environments with minimal water availability. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities in these regions.</p>
<p>It is often considered a weed in areas where it becomes established outside its native range.</p>
