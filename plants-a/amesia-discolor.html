                    <h1>Amesia discolor</h1>
<p>Amesia discolor, commonly known as frostweed, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces tiny, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Its leaves are typically grayish-green and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Amesia discolor is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
