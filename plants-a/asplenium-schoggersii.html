                    <h1>Asplenium schoggersii</h1>
<p>Asplenium schoggersii, commonly known as the Schoggers' spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. The plant typically produces spore-bearing sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
