                <h1>Acisanthera nana</h1>
<p>Acisanthera nana, commonly known as the dwarf acisanthera, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with compact foliage and delicate, clustered flowers. The plant prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, adding a subtle elegance to its appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acisanthera nana has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera nana is primarily native to the Andes Mountains of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude regions with cool, temperate climates. This plant is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous areas. It is often associated with alpine environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera nana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, small, yellow flowers. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in moist, disturbed habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>However, it is currently not considered a major invasive threat in the region.</p>
