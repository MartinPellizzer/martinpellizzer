                    <h1>Asplenium × tandinii</h1>
<p>Asplenium × tandinii, commonly known as the hybrid rock fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is a compact, evergreen fern characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in small, rounded spore-producing structures called sporangia. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it can thrive in low-light conditions. Its unique morphology and ability to form dense colonies make it a notable species in its native range.</p>
<p>Asplenium × tandinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems where it contributes to soil stabilization and habitat diversity.</p>
