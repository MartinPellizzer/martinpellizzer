                    <h1>Acacia chalkeri</h1>
<p>Acacia chalkeri, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom throughout the dry season. The plant produces flat, bean-like pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Acacia chalkeri is adapted to survive in harsh, low-nutrient soils and can tolerate high temperatures and drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its leaves are typically small and feathery, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
