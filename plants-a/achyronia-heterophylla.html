                <h1>Achyronia heterophylla</h1>
<p>Achyronia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, which can range from ovate to heart-shaped, depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces showy, pale pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its hairy stems and leaves are adapted to arid environments, allowing it to conserve water efficiently.</p>
<p>Achyronia heterophylla is often found in dry, rocky soils and is a common species in desert ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia heterophylla has leaves that are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside, varying in size from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, woody, and has a smooth, pale greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white to pale pink petals, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>
