                    <h1>Aptenia</h1>
<p>Aptenia, commonly known as the ice plant or snowplant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae.</p>
<p>These succulent plants are native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and are known for their compact, low-growing form. They produce small, brightly colored flowers, often in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in summer. Aptenia species are drought-tolerant and thrive in well-drained soil, making them popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Their fleshy leaves and ability to store water contribute to their resilience in arid environments.</p>
