                <h1>Aegiphila glomerata</h1>
<p>Aegiphila glomerata, commonly known as the clustered aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of purple and violet. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Aegiphila glomerata is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila glomerata has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry, rocky environments where the plant typically grows.</p>
