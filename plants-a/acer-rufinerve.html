                <h1>Acer rufinerve</h1>
<p>Acer rufinerve, commonly known as the red-veined maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking foliage, with leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The leaves are palmately lobed and have distinctive red veins that are prominent even during the growing season. It produces small, clustered flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>This ornamental tree is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer rufinerve has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size of about 5-10 cm in length, and a vibrant green color that turns yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, light brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The flowers are small, inconspicuous greenish-white structures that appear in clusters, blooming in early spring, and are primarily wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and winged structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, helping to absorb water and nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer rufinerve is a species of maple native to eastern Asia, specifically China, where it occurs in the mountainous regions of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes cultivation in botanical gardens and private collections outside its native range, though it remains rare in the wild. It thrives in temperate forests, often growing in moist, well-drained soils under shaded conditions. Acer rufinerve is typically found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is listed as endangered in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer rufinerve is a striking ornamental maple known for its vibrant red veins and maple-like foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a slow initial growth phase, followed by rapid development in spring and summer, with a dormant period in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with scale insects or powdery mildew, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer rufinerve is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of surrounding vegetation. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the soil structure in its habitat.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer rufinerve contributes to carbon sequestration, offering long-term ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer rufinerve is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas. In medicinal contexts, it has been studied for potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and provides habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is appreciated in horticulture for its vibrant autumn foliage, making it a symbol of seasonal change and natural beauty.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer rufinerve has several popular cultivars that are highly valued in horticulture, such as 'Crimson Queen' and 'Redmond', known for their vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>It also has been used in hybridization to create varieties with enhanced ornamental traits and improved hardiness. Hybrid forms often combine the striking red leaves of Acer rufinerve with the structural benefits of other maple species. These hybrids are particularly popular in gardens and landscapes for their visual appeal.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer rufinerve and its cultivars and hybrids play a significant role in ornamental horticulture due to their aesthetic value and adaptability.</p>
