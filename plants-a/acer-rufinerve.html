                <h1>Acer rufinerve</h1>
<p>Acer rufinerve, commonly known as the red-veined maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red veins that run through its palmate leaves, which are usually green with a striking red or orange underside. The tree produces small, clustered flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and dark grey, becoming fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer rufinerve has alternate, palmately compound leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter green underside, reaching up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to stabilize the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer rufinerve is a small deciduous tree native to the eastern Himalayas, primarily found in countries such as India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to various parts of the world, including parts of Europe and North America, often as an ornamental plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in temperate climates, typically found in mountainous regions. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted natural habitat and limited population, Acer rufinerve is considered to be of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer rufinerve is a striking ornamental maple known for its vibrant red veins and delicate foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for optimal germination. The growth cycle of Acer rufinerve includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by a rest period in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and promote health are essential for its maintenance. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving perennials or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
