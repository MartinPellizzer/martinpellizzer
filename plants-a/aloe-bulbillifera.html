                    <h1>Aloe bulbillifera</h1>
<p>Aloe bulbillifera, commonly known as the bulbil-bearing aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted for water storage. The plant produces offsets called bulbils, which are small plantlets that can develop into new individuals. These bulbils are often found at the base of the leaves and are a key feature of its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Aloe bulbillifera is well-suited to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
