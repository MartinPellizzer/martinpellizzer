                <h1>Adiantum refractum</h1>
<p>Adiantum refractum, commonly known as the brittle bladder fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically light green to grayish in color. The fronds are often described as brittle, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus Adiantum. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or near streams.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum refractum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, typically measuring 10â€“30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark. It does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-producing plant, and instead reproduces via spores released from the undersides of the leaves. The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Its overall morphology is well adapted for a moist, shaded environment, typical of its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum refractum is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands, stream banks, and rocky areas. This fern thrives in temperate climates and is often seen in the understory of forests. Its native range extends from southern Ontario down through the eastern United States to Florida.</p>
<p>It is an adaptable species that can grow in a variety of soil types as long as there is adequate moisture.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum refractum was mainly introduced to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. The plant is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native species. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in both natural and human-altered habitats.</p>
<p>Its presence has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on local biodiversity.</p>
