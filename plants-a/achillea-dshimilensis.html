                <h1>Achillea dshimilensis</h1>
<p>Achillea dshimilensis, commonly known as the Dshimil Mountain yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range in color from white to pale yellow.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea dshimilensis has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a serrated margin and a gray-green color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a pale green color, with a branching growth pattern that allows for a dense shrub-like appearance. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding brown disk florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in suitable habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea dshimilensis is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the eastern Himalayas, primarily found in Nepal and Bhutan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these mountainous areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky slopes and forest understories. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 2,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Achillea dshimilensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea dshimilensis is a hardy perennial known for its feathery foliage and bright yellow flowers, commonly cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. The plant has a biennial growth cycle, with the first year focusing on root development and the second year producing flowers before dying back.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea dshimilensis is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, which rely on its blooms for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. Additionally, its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>It also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>
