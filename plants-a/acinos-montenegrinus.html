                <h1>Acinos montenegrinus</h1>
<p>Acinos montenegrinus, commonly known as the Montenegrin sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy foliage. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are usually pink or white, adding a delicate touch to its rocky habitat.</p>
<p>Acinos montenegrinus is often found in open slopes and meadows at elevations above 1,500 meters.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos montenegrinus has leaves that are typically narrow, linear to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green color and a hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, often branching, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, with five petals and a tubular base, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos montenegrinus is primarily native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans, specifically in Montenegro and parts of Albania.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. This plant is adapted to the cold and harsh climate of its native habitat, often growing at elevations above 1,500 meters. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos montenegrinus was mainly introduced to the Balkan region, particularly Montenegro, as a result of its ornamental value and adaptability to mountainous environments.</p>
<p>It has since been found growing in scattered populations across parts of southern Europe, including Albania and Kosovo. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky and alpine habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native flora in invaded areas.</p>
<p>Despite its spread, it remains a relatively localized and less invasive species compared to other introduced plants in the region.</p>
