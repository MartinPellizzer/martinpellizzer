                <h1>Adicea cuneiformis</h1>
<p>Adicea cuneiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf adicea, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Adicea cuneiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea cuneiformis has leaves that are narrowly triangular in shape, with a pointed tip and a broad base, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The stem is slender, slightly woody, with a rough, bark-like texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are white or pale pink, with five petals and a tubular structure, blooming in spring and attracting insects for pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds, and the roots are fibrous, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea cuneiformis is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of South Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Lesotho, and Swaziland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grassland and savanna habitats, often growing in well-drained soils. This plant is typically associated with open vegetation types and can be found in both coastal and inland areas. It is adapted to a range of climatic conditions but prefers areas with moderate rainfall.</p>
<p>Adicea cuneiformis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insect species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea cuneiformis was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become naturalized in various regions. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found along roadsides and in coastal areas. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through accidental seed dispersal via human activity.</p>
<p>It is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
