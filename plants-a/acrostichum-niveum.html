                <h1>Acrostichum niveum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum niveum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the fern family and is characterized by its distinctive silver-colored fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically pinnately divided with a soft, velvety texture.</p>
<p>Acrostichum niveum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also significant in traditional culture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum niveum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are bright green, with a smooth texture and a waxy coating, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind once it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor firmly in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum niveum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the margins of rivers and lakes. This plant thrives in humid environments with abundant moisture and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems. Its distribution extends from southern Florida through the Caribbean islands to parts of northern South America.</p>
<p>It is also occasionally found in the southeastern United States, though more commonly in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum niveum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas where it thrives in salty and humid conditions. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several non-native habitats across the globe.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts.</p>
