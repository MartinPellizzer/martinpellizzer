                <h1>Aegialina pubescens</h1>
<p>Aegialina pubescens, commonly known as the salt marsh morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, creeping stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in the early morning. It thrives in brackish or saline environments, making it well adapted to tidal marshes and estuaries.</p>
<p>Aegialina pubescens plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegialina pubescens has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color on the upper surface, contrasting with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a slightly hairy texture and a pale greenish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or coastal soils.</p>
