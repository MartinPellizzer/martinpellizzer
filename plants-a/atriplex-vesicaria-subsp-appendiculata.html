<p>Atriplex vesicaria subsp.</p>
<p>appendiculata, commonly known as the sandmat, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and arid environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help store water, and it typically grows in sandy or coastal soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are often borne on erect, branched stems. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor in loose, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in regions with high salinity, such as salt marshes and coastal dunes.</p>
