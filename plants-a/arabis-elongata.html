<p>Arabis elongata, commonly known as the elongated rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>Arabis elongata typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes.</p>
