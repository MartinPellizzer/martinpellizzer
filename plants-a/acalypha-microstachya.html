                <h1>Acalypha microstachya</h1>
<p>Acalypha microstachya, commonly known as the velvetleaf or small-stalked beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, often hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that develop into blue-black berries, which are edible for birds and some mammals. Acalypha microstachya thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in warmer climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha microstachya has alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 2–5 cm long and 1–2.5 cm wide, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, upright, and slightly woody, with a smooth, pale green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers with stamen clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after maturity.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha microstachya is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands, likely due to human introduction. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and forest edges. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its distribution is limited, and it faces threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
