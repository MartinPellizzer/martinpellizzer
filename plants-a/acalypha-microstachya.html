                        <h1>Acalypha microstachya</h1>
<p>Acalypha microstachya, commonly known as the red-rooted spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant characterized by its striking red stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-yellow flowers that are often surrounded by bracts. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Acalypha microstachya is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha microstachya is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, lowland areas, including rainforests and swampy habitats. This plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is often associated with riverine vegetation. It is also present in parts of Madagascar and some islands in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes be found in disturbed or cultivated areas near its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha microstachya was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was first brought there in the late 19th century by horticulturists who admired its vibrant green leaves and unique growth habit. Despite its ornamental value, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native vegetation in wet forest areas. The plant spreads rapidly through its prolific seed production and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting efforts to control its spread in natural habitats.</p>
