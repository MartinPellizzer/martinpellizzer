                    <h1>Ascalonicum scorodoprasum</h1>
<p>Ascalonicum scorodoprasum, commonly known as wild garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Alliaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces bulbils on its stems, which can be used for propagation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its strong garlic-like odor is due to the presence of sulfur-containing compounds in its foliage.</p>
