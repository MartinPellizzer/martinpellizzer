                    <h1>Alsophila costalis</h1>
<p>Alsophila costalis, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its growth as an evergreen tree fern.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent at night, which helps attract nocturnal pollinators.</p>
