                <h1>Acer tetramerum var. lobulatum</h1>
<p>Acer tetramerum var. lobulatum, commonly known as the Pacific silver fir, is a variant of the Pacific silver fir native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant is an evergreen conifer that produces cones and has a distinctive pyramidal shape. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum var. lobulatum has palmate leaves that are typically 5-lobed, with a lobed shape, alternate arrangement, and a moderate size, usually ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in diameter.</p>
<p>The leaves are bright green during the growing season and turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. The stem is smooth and slender, with a light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a spreading, upright pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in cymes, blooming in early spring before the leaves fully develop, and they are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two wings, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread across open areas.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum var. lobulatum is a rare variant of the Pacific madrone, native to the coastal regions of northern California and southern Oregon.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas, primarily within the Klamath Mountains. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in mixed evergreen forests. This species is typically found at elevations between 300 and 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat loss, it is listed as endangered in California, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum var. lobulatum is a shade-tolerant deciduous tree known for its distinctive lobed leaves and adaptability to various environments.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions, making it a good companion plant for ferns and hostas in shaded gardens.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum var. lobulatum is a small, shrub-like plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, red flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest understories, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion, particularly on rocky or steep slopes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a variety of insect and animal life.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum var. lobulatum is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use due to its small, bitter seeds and unpalatable leaves.</p>
<p>However, it has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. In industrial contexts, its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, making it suitable for small-scale carpentry and furniture-making. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions, representing resilience and adaptability.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications are more ecological and ornamental, contributing to local biodiversity and landscape aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum var. lobulatum has several popular cultivars, including 'Crimson Sunset' and 'Autumn Flame', which are prized for their vibrant fall color.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, such as Acer rubrum and Acer saccharum, to produce ornamental varieties with enhanced growth habits and color. These hybrids often exhibit improved cold hardiness and faster growth rates compared to the species itself. Horticulturally, this variety is valued for its unique foliage and adaptability to a range of soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its use in landscaping and garden design highlights its importance in the cultivation of ornamental trees.</p>
