<p>Aponogeton abyssinicus var. cordatus, commonly known as the Abyssinian arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to Africa.</p>
<p>It features elongated, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with a waxy texture that helps repel water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, adding ornamental value to ponds and water gardens. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with moderate to high light exposure.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize areas efficiently while maintaining a compact growth habit.</p>
