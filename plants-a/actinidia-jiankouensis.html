                <h1>Actinidia jiankouensis</h1>
<p>Actinidia jiankouensis, commonly known as the Jiankou actinidia, is a rare species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Actinidiaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its fruit is a small, yellow berry that ripens in late summer, though it is not widely cultivated.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia jiankouensis has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a heart-shaped base, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, greenish-yellow berry that contains numerous seeds, and it is dispersed primarily by birds after ripening.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia jiankouensis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of northern China, specifically in the provinces of Hebei and Shanxi.</p>
<p>It grows in temperate forests at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 meters. This species is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and moderate humidity. It thrives in shaded environments under the canopy of mature forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia jiankouensis was mainly introduced to China, where it is native to the mountainous regions of northern and western provinces.</p>
<p>It is typically found in humid, temperate climates with well-drained soil. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential medicinal properties. It has been cultivated in botanical gardens and research institutions to study its ecological role and genetic diversity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this rare species.</p>
