                <h1>Actaea podocarpa</h1>
<p>Actaea podocarpa, commonly known as the red baneberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of white flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its berries are toxic to humans and animals, containing cardiogenic toxins that can cause severe illness if ingested.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, Actaea podocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea podocarpa has palmately compound leaves that are typically 5-11 lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, smooth, and somewhat woody, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in upright clusters during late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dark red, berry-like aggregate, which disperses its seeds through animal consumption.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping it spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea podocarpa is primarily native to eastern North America, specifically the eastern United States and parts of southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks. This species thrives in rich, loamy soils and is often associated with deciduous forests. Its range extends from New York and Pennsylvania southward to Georgia and westward to Ohio and Tennessee.</p>
<p>It is also present in some regions of Ontario, Canada.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea podocarpa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, which allows it to spread rapidly in forested regions.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
