<p>Aria nivea subsp.</p>
<p>scandica, commonly known as the alpine snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cold, high-altitude conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.</p>
