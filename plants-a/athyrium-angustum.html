<p>Athyrium angustum, commonly known as narrow fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help it spread and colonize moist, shaded environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Athyrium angustum prefers humid, shaded habitats and is often found in forest understories.</p>
