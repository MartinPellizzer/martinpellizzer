<p>Atriplex lindleyi subsp.</p>
<p>lindleyi, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in sandy or saline soils and plays a role in stabilizing desert landscapes.</p>
