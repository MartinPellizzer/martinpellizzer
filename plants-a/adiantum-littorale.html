                <h1>Adiantum littorale</h1>
<p>Adiantum littorale, commonly known as the coastal maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to coastal regions of the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along rocky shores and in sandy soils. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to stabilize coastal soils.</p>
<p>Adiantum littorale is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in coastal ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum littorale has fern-like leaves that are bipinnate, with a delicate, feathered appearance, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure around 10-20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green, with a finely toothed margin and a glossy surface. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a simple, branching pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are wind-pollinated and consist of separate male and female structures.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum littorale is primarily native to coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa and Namibia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, often found in dune environments. This fern is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds typical of coastal habitats. It is commonly seen in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to these specific coastal areas, making it a rare and specialized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum littorale was mainly introduced to coastal areas and moist habitats, particularly in regions with temperate climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, stream banks, and shaded rock crevices. This plant has been reported in several parts of Europe and North America, often as an ornamental species. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some native ecosystems, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Despite its spread, it is generally considered to have a limited ecological impact compared to other invasive species.</p>
