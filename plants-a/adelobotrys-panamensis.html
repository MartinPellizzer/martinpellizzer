                <h1>Adelobotrys panamensis</h1>
<p>Adelobotrys panamensis, commonly known as the Panama starfruit, is a flowering plant native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are edible and have a tangy, citrus-like flavor. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Adelobotrys panamensis is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its culinary uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys panamensis has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that has a somewhat flaky texture, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in axillary inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a fleshy, red berry that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys panamensis is primarily native to Central America, specifically Panama and parts of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical lowland forests and is often associated with limestone soils. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in the understory of dense rainforests. It is not widely distributed beyond its native range and is considered a regional endemic.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its population is threatened, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys panamensis was mainly introduced to the Greater Antilles, particularly Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica, as part of ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there during the 19th and 20th centuries due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to tropical climates. The plant has since naturalized in some regions, becoming a common component of secondary vegetation. It is now considered an invasive species in certain areas of the Caribbean, outcompeting native plants.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native ornamental plants.</p>
