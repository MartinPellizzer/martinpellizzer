                    <h1>Antiphytum parryi</h1>
<p>Antiphytum parryi, commonly known as the Parry's antiphytum, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Antiphytum parryi is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study in desert ecosystems.</p>
