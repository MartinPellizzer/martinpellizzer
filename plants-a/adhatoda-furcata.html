                <h1>Adhatoda furcata</h1>
<p>Adhatoda furcata, commonly known as the Indian Trumpet or Blue Trumpet, is a flowering plant native to India and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and striking blue or violet flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Adhatoda furcata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in traditional medicine and ecological studies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda furcata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. The flowers are clustered in terminal spikes, featuring tubular corollas with purple and white hues, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda furcata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with secondary growth forests. It is also present in some parts of Africa and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Adhatoda furcata is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional medicine for centuries.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda furcata was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species and to enhance biodiversity in degraded ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it suitable for regions with high rainfall. It has been successfully introduced in several countries in Africa and Asia for its ecological and medicinal benefits.</p>
<p>However, its spread requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive itself.</p>
