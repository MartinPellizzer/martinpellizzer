                <h1>Acer monspessulanum var. integrilobum</h1>
<p>Acer monspessulanum var. integrilobum, commonly known as the Spanish maple, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters with a rounded crown and smooth, grey bark. The leaves are palmately lobed, with five to seven lobes that are entire or slightly toothed. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring followed by winged seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum var. integrilobum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5–10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, turning red or orange in autumn. The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles during late spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruits are samaras, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to its natural habitat in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum var. integrilobum is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the Iberian Peninsula, specifically found in southern Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the southern regions of Spain. It thrives in warm, temperate climates, often growing in rocky soils along coastal areas and in dry, sunny habitats. This species typically occurs at low altitudes, usually below 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum var. integrilobum is a slow-growing, ornamental maple known for its distinctive lobed leaves and autumn color.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by active growth in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, fertile soil and regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving perennials or evergreens can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum var. integrilobum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecosystem health. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving soil quality and supporting a wide range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum var. integrilobum is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use due to its small, bitter fruits.</p>
<p>It has been historically used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. While not widely utilized in industrial applications, its wood may have niche uses in crafts or small-scale woodworking. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in certain regions, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, its role remains largely ecological and ornamental, contributing to biodiversity and landscape aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum var. integrilobum has a range of varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Sutherlandii' and 'Crimson King,' known for their striking foliage colors and compact growth habits. Hybrids with other maple species, such as Acer palmatum, have been developed to enhance traits like cold hardiness and leaf coloration. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their adaptability and visual appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>They are widely used in landscaping for their seasonal interest and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
