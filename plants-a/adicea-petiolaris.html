                <h1>Adicea petiolaris</h1>
<p>Adicea petiolaris, commonly known as the slender-stemmed adicea, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and alternate leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape. Its flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, often with a distinctive calyx.</p>
<p>Adicea petiolaris is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or grassland habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea petiolaris has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, slightly hairy, and have a pale green bark that becomes rough with age, growing in a trailing or climbing pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white with five petals, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea petiolaris is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grassland and savanna habitats, often growing in well-drained soils. The plant is adapted to seasonal rainfall patterns and can tolerate periods of drought. It is also occasionally found in parts of Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>Adicea petiolaris plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various insect and bird species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea petiolaris was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have led to its classification as a noxious weed.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread and prevent further ecological damage.</p>
