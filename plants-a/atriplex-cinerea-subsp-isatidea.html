<p>Atriplex cinerea subsp.</p>
<p>isatidea, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which reflects sunlight and reduces water loss.</p>

<p>This subspecies is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable plant for stabilizing coastal and desert environments.</p>
