<p>Arachniodes hekouensis, commonly known as the Hekou bamboo-fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its unique, delicate fronds that resemble spider webs, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, moist soil. Its leaves are divided into intricate, feather-like segments, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
