                    <h1>Aerisilvaea serrata</h1>
<p>Aerisilvaea serrata, commonly known as the serrated forest fern, is a species characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are distinctly serrated along the edges.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forest understories where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. Its leaves are bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This rare species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining forest biodiversity.</p>
