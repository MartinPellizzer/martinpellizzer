                <h1>Achillea × feliciana</h1>
<p>Achillea × feliciana, commonly known as the Queen Anne's lace of the garden, is a hybrid perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and flat-topped clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is native to the southeastern United States and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × feliciana has compound, fern-like leaves that are finely divided, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged in a basal rosette.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is clump-forming. The flowers are compound umbels with small, white to pale yellow florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry achene, and seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to dry conditions and helping the plant survive in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × feliciana is a hybrid plant native to the southeastern United States, particularly in regions of Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida.</p>
<p>While it was originally found in the wild, it is now widely cultivated and distributed across the United States, especially in gardens and landscaped areas. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed sites. It typically occurs at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to about 300 meters.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its hybrid origin and cultivation status mean its natural wild populations are less common and require conservation efforts to maintain genetic diversity.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea × feliciana is a hardy perennial known for its vibrant, flat-topped flower heads and silver-green foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a long growth cycle, blooming from late spring to early fall, with a dormant period in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding over-saturation. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its compact shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if conditions are too wet.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or yarrow can enhance its ornamental value and promote biodiversity in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
