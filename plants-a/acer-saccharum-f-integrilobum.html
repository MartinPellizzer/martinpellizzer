                    <h1>Acer saccharum f. integrilobum</h1>
<p>Acer saccharum f. integrilobum, commonly known as the smooth-leaf sugar maple, is a variant of the sugar maple tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, unlobed leaves, which distinguish it from the more commonly seen lobed leaves of the typical sugar maple. The plant is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas, often in the understory of mixed hardwood forests. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring followed by winged seeds in the fall.</p>
<p>This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
