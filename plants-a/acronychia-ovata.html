                <h1>Acronychia ovata</h1>
<p>Acronychia ovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to northern Australia and is characterized by its smooth, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits. It is typically found in coastal areas and can thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Acronychia ovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia ovata has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is dark brown to grey in color, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white or pale yellow petals, and they bloom during the wet season, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, often forming a dense network in the understory of tropical forests.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia ovata is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical rainforests and coastal areas. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and often grows in dense understorey vegetation. It is also present in some parts of New Guinea.</p>
<p>Acronychia ovata is known for its distinctive, smooth, greyish bark and is often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia ovata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often seen growing in shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
