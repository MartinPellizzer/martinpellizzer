                    <h1>Acacia gonophylla</h1>
<p>Acacia gonophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a small, multi-stemmed shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and compound leaves composed of multiple small, linear leaflets. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that appear in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its grey-green foliage. Acacia gonophylla is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions, with deep root systems that help it access groundwater.</p>
<p>It is also an important plant for local wildlife, providing nectar for insects and birds.</p>
