<p>Aconitum pyramidale var. bicolor, commonly known as the Pyramidal Monkshood, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features tall, spires of blue to purple flowers with distinctive hood-like petals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has deeply lobed, palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky down. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.</p>
