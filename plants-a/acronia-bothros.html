                <h1>Acronia bothros</h1>
<p>Acronia bothros, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acronia, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features slender stems and lanceolate leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and typically display shades of yellow or orange.</p>
<p>Acronia bothros is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and floral characteristics.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia bothros has compound, pinnate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a serrated edge and a moderate size, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, clustered in terminal panicles, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia bothros is primarily native to the Mediterranean Basin, including regions such as southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky habitats and dry, sunny areas where it can thrive with minimal water. This plant is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native range, often growing in coastal cliffs and mountainous terrains. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches that provide the right balance of sunlight, drainage, and temperature.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, its native range has become increasingly fragmented.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia bothros was mainly introduced to coastal and estuarine environments along the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish water conditions, often found in tidal marshes and mangrove swamps. The plant's introduction has been linked to human activities such as coastal development and the discharge of treated wastewater. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its spread beyond its original introduction sites.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains under study due to its relatively recent establishment in these regions.</p>
