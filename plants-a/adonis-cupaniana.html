                <h1>Adonis cupaniana</h1>
<p>Adonis cupaniana, commonly known as the cupuanian adonis, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Adonis cupaniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climatic conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis cupaniana has leaves that are basal, lanceolate in shape, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is typically branching at the base. Its flowers are showy, consisting of five petals, with a yellow color and a reddish-orange center, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in its native arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis cupaniana is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky soils and open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. This plant thrives in areas with mild, temperate climates and is often associated with limestone or chalk substrates. It is particularly prevalent in countries like Spain, France, Italy, and Turkey.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is sometimes considered a rare or locally distributed species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis cupaniana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges. This plant has become naturalized in several states including Oregon and Washington. It is often mistaken for native species due to its similar appearance.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native invasive species in some areas, posing a threat to local ecosystems.</p>
