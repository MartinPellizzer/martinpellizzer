                <h1>Achillea schreineri</h1>
<p>Achillea schreineri, commonly known as Schreiner's yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in summer. Its leaves are finely divided and gray-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Schreiner's yarrow is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea schreineri has leaves that are narrow, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a gray-green color and a fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough and fissured with age, and it grows in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are compound umbels composed of small, white to pale yellow petals, blooming in early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, and the seeds are lightweight and easily carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>
