                    <h1>Arundo gayana</h1>
<p>Arundo gayana, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It has long, narrow leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with a fibrous, hollow stem that is often used in construction and crafts. The plant thrives in wetlands, riverbanks, and other moist environments, making it a common aquatic or semi-aquatic species. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an effective erosion control plant.</p>
<p>However, it can also become invasive in non-native habitats, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
