<p>Acronia pseudopogon, commonly known as the false beard lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Trapeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically dark green to black in color, with a distinctive white or pale margin. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to lichenologists and conservationists.</p>
