<p>Acacia dasyphylla, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and feathery, bipinnate leaves that are grey-green in color. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to coastal and sandy environments.</p>
<p>Acacia dasyphylla is also valued for its role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
