                        <h1>Acacia trinervata var. brevifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia trinervata var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are finely divided and give the plant a feathery appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical heads, typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in revegetation projects.</p>
