                    <h1>Aloe komaggasensis</h1>
<p>Aloe komaggasensis, commonly known as the Komagata Mountains aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and resilience make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
