<p>It features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are surrounded by bracts, which can be colorful and showy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ornamental plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha lanceolata var. lanceolata has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a glossy dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stems are cylindrical, smooth, and green, growing upright with a branching pattern.
