                <h1>Acacia cupeyensis</h1>
<p>Acacia cupeyensis, commonly known as the Cuban acacia, is a flowering plant native to Cuba.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and limestone soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, globular inflorescences. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, narrow leaflets.</p>
<p>Acacia cupeyensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia cupeyensis has compound leaves that are bipinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a feather-like pattern along the stems.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically green, with a slightly glossy surface, and they are arranged alternately along the branches. The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a woody growth pattern. The flowers are yellow and clustered in cylindrical inflorescences, blooming during the dry season, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a pod that splits open to release small, ellipsoid seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia cupeyensis is a shrub native to the Caribbean, specifically found in the island of Cuba.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to the western part of the island, particularly in the region of Guant√°namo. It thrives in dry, tropical environments with well-drained soils. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, Acacia cupeyensis is classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia cupeyensis is a hardy shrub native to tropical regions, known for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in diverse conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring scarification and a warm, moist environment for germination. The growth cycle of Acacia cupeyensis is relatively fast, with new growth appearing in spring and reaching maturity within a few years.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions that can lead to root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to maintain shape and encourage flowering are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but can be affected by scale insects and fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with legumes can improve soil fertility and deter some pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acacia cupeyensis is a vital component of its ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its nectar-rich flowers. The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil and supporting the growth of other plants. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape.</p>
<p>Additionally, it serves as a companion plant, enhancing biodiversity in its surrounding habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acacia cupeyensis is a plant native to specific regions of South America, known for its various uses and applications.</p>
