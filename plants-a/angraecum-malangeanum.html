<p>Angraecum malangeanum, commonly known as the Malangean orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It features long, slender pseudobulbs and produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink with dark purple markings. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Its flowers are often nocturnal, opening at night and closing in the morning, which is a unique adaptation for pollination by moths.</p>
