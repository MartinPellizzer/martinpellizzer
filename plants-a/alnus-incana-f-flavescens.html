                    <h1>Alnus incana f. flavescens</h1>
<p>Alnus incana f. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-leafed alder, is a variant of the grey alder native to northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>This plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its yellowish-green leaves, which are often smaller and more densely arranged than those of the typical alnus species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
