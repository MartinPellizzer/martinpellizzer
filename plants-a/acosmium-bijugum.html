                <h1>Acosmium bijugum</h1>
<p>Acosmium bijugum, commonly known as the twin-lobed acosmium, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many plants with showy flowers and milky sap. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The plant's ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking exotic foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosmium bijugum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale yellow, consisting of four petals and numerous stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosmium bijugum is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans across eastern Brazil. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within the understory of dense forests. It is also known to occur in parts of Paraguay and Argentina.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific ecological zones within South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosmium bijugum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and wetlands. The plant is often associated with wet or seasonally flooded areas, which supports its establishment in these regions. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, its ecological impact is still being studied.</p>
