                        <h1>Abutilon denticulatum</h1>
<p>Abutilon denticulatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a herbaceous plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Abutilon denticulatum is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it both a common weed and a plant of ecological interest.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon denticulatum is primarily native to Central America, including countries such as Guatemala, Belize, and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is also found in the Caribbean islands, particularly in regions like Cuba and Hispaniola. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and along riverbanks. It is commonly found in dry to moist forests and is adapted to well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into northern South America, including parts of Colombia and Venezuela.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon denticulatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-like flowers.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in moist, disturbed areas along the coast and in riparian zones. The plant thrives in coastal climates with moderate temperatures and high humidity. It is often found growing along trails, stream banks, and in forest edges.</p>
