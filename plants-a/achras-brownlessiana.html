                <h1>Achras brownlessiana</h1>
<p>Achras brownlessiana, commonly known as the Brazilian palm, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that turn red when mature. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>The plant has a slow growth rate and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras brownlessiana has large, palmate leaves that are broad and deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing as a solitary trunk. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in a dense, branched inflorescence, which bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains numerous seeds, dispersed primarily by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, anchoring the plant and helping it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras brownlessiana is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. This plant typically grows in coastal areas and dry forests, often near the sea. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its natural distribution is limited to these specific geographic regions within the Caribbean.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras brownlessiana was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential for use in landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with warm climates and well-drained soil, such as parts of Central America and the Caribbean. The plant's unique appearance, including its large, spiny fruit and attractive foliage, makes it a popular choice for gardeners and horticulturists. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
