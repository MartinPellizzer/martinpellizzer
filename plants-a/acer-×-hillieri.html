                        <h1>Acer × hillieri</h1>
<p>Acer × hillieri, commonly known as the Hillieri maple, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Acer caeruleum and Acer griseum.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10 to 15 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are palmately lobed, with a serrated margin and a bright green upper surface that turns vibrant red or orange in autumn. Its bark is smooth and light grey, becoming fissured with age, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to a range of soil conditions.</p>
