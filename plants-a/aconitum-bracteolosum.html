<p>Aconitum bracteolosum, commonly known as the bracteolate monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound, pinnately arranged leaves with serrated edges, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
