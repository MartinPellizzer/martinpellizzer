                    <h1>Allocarya ramosa</h1>
<p>Allocarya ramosa, commonly known as the branched broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often white or pale in color. It is native to regions of Eurasia and is typically found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems by influencing the growth and distribution of its host species.</p>
