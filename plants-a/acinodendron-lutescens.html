                <h1>Acinodendron lutescens</h1>
<p>Acinodendron lutescens, commonly known as the yellow acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and trees. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are usually opposite and elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Acinodendron lutescens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and thickets.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron lutescens has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, while the underside is lighter in color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with yellow petals and a tubular structure, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron lutescens is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within these regions. The plant is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often near streams or in moist undergrowth. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed outside of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron lutescens was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential use in horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils. The plant has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines, as well as parts of Africa and the Caribbean. Due to its adaptability, it has sometimes become an invasive species in these regions.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
