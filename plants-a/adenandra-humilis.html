                <h1>Adenandra humilis</h1>
<p>Adenandra humilis, commonly known as the silverleaf adenandra, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grayish-green foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive silvery underside, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Adenandra humilis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and hardy nature.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra humilis has small, elliptic-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels off in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the winter months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra humilis is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Cape Province and extends into parts of Lesotho and Swaziland. This plant thrives in rocky, coastal areas and is commonly found in fynbos vegetation. It is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, characterized by wet winters and dry summers.</p>
<p>Adenandra humilis is an important component of the local flora and is often found in coastal scrub and sand dune environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra humilis was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces, growing in fynbos vegetation. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in coastal and mountainous areas. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
