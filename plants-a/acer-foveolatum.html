                <h1>Acer foveolatum</h1>
<p>Acer foveolatum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red to orange-red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental species. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5â€“9 cm in length. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and reddish-brown when young, becoming furrowed with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer foveolatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length; they are bright green during the growing season and turn vibrant yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in inflorescences; they bloom in early spring and are primarily wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to the wings.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer foveolatum is a small deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, specifically found in the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia, though its range has become fragmented. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in mixed hardwood forests and along stream valleys. This species typically grows at elevations between 600 and 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acer foveolatum is listed as endangered in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer foveolatum is a decorative maple tree known for its unique, deeply lobed leaves and vibrant fall color.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of this species includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches promote healthy growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs like azalea or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer foveolatum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, yellowish flowers. Its dense canopy acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing biodiversity. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a wide range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer foveolatum is a small deciduous tree known for its ornamental value, often cultivated in gardens and parks for its attractive foliage and unique bark.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas. In medicinal practices, it has been studied for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Industrially, it contributes to the ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is sometimes symbolized in local art and literature as a representation of resilience and natural beauty.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer foveolatum has several popular cultivars, such as 'Orange Glow' and 'Crimson King', which are prized for their vibrant fall color and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>The species is also involved in creating hybrids with other maple species, leading to unique foliage patterns and improved hardiness in certain cultivars. These hybrids often exhibit enhanced adaptability to different climates, making them valuable for horticultural use. Due to its ornamental value, Acer foveolatum plays an important role in landscaping and garden design.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids contribute to the diversity of maple trees available for cultivation in temperate regions.</p>
