                <h1>Achnopogon steyermarkii</h1>
<p>Achnopogon steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's spurge, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in complex inflorescences called cyathia. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in wetland or marshy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnopogon steyermarkii has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and range from 5 to 15 cm in length with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, slender, and covered with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a single, unbranched pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with a pale blue or violet color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnopogon steyermarkii is primarily native to Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is found in the northeastern region of the country, particularly in the states of Barinas and Portuguesa. This plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within Venezuela.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnopogon steyermarkii was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, ditches, and open fields. This plant is adapted to sandy and well-drained soils, which are prevalent in these regions. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including transportation and land development.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive potential, it is not considered a major ecological threat in its introduced range.</p>
