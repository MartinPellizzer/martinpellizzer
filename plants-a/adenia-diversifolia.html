                <h1>Adenia diversifolia</h1>
<p>Adenia diversifolia, commonly known as the African bellflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant has a climbing habit, often using its tendrils to support itself on other vegetation. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture.</p>
<p>Adenia diversifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia diversifolia has alternate, simple, and elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown in color, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. Its flowers are large, showy, and have a complex structure with five petals, often displaying bright yellow or orange colors, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia diversifolia is primarily native to eastern and northern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in rainforests, wetlands, and along riverbanks. The plant is commonly associated with moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It is a woody vine or shrub that can grow up to several meters in height.</p>
<p>Adenia diversifolia is also occasionally found in parts of New Guinea and some nearby islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia diversifolia was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded habitats, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil, often found in forest understories or along streambanks. The plant is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections due to its ornamental value and unique foliage. Its introduction has sometimes led to naturalization in regions with similar climatic conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is generally not considered invasive in most areas where it is introduced.</p>
