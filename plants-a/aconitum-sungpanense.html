                <h1>Aconitum sungpanense</h1>
<p>Aconitum sungpanense, commonly known as the Sungpan monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in areas accessible to children or pets.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum sungpanense has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and cylindrical, with a greyish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and clustered in racemes, blooming in summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle containing small, dark seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for storage and anchoring the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum sungpanense is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude habitats, often found in forested areas and rocky slopes at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters. This species is also occasionally reported in adjacent regions of northern Vietnam and northern Myanmar. It prefers cool, moist climates with well-drained soil, making it a characteristic plant of temperate montane ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum sungpanense was mainly introduced to the data as a rare and endemic species native to specific regions in China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and is often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant's introduction to the dataset highlights its ecological significance and potential for botanical research. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
<p>This data entry aids in conservation efforts and understanding its natural habitat.</p>
