                    <h1>Arsenococcus frondosus</h1>
<p>Arsenococcus frondosus, commonly known as the golden fern, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, feather-like fronds that give it a fern-like appearance, though it is not a true fern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental value. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to extreme environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Arsenococcus frondosus is also notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a subject of interest in ecological and horticultural studies.</p>
