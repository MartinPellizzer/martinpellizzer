                    <h1>Andropogon asperifolius</h1>
<p>Andropogon asperifolius, commonly known as roughleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and clay soils. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and along roadsides, forming dense stands that help prevent soil erosion. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Andropogon asperifolius is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ecological benefits.</p>
