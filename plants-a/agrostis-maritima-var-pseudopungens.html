                    <h1>Agrostis maritima var. pseudopungens</h1>
<p>Agrostis maritima var. pseudopungens, commonly known as the coastal bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are adapted to coastal environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is tolerant of salt spray and wind.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes.</p>
