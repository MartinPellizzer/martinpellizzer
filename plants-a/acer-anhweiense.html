                <h1>Acer anhweiense</h1>
<p>Acer anhweiense, commonly known as the Anhwei maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Acer, which includes various maple species known for their ornamental value. The tree is characterized by its palmate leaves with five lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. It typically grows to a height of 10–15 meters and prefers well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to different climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer anhweiense has palmately compound leaves that are usually 5-7 lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and grows upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer anhweiense is a rare species of maple native to eastern China, specifically found in the provinces of Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Although its native range was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few fragmented populations in the mountainous regions of southern China. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within evergreen forests, typically at altitudes between 800 and 1,500 meters. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Acer anhweiense is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and restore its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer anhweiense is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves rapid initial growth followed by slower development, with the tree reaching maturity in 10–15 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a healthy garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer anhweiense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, aiding in the reproduction of other plants in the ecosystem. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, promoting the growth of neighboring plants through shade and nutrient cycling. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the soil and protecting against water runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer anhweiense plays a role in carbon sequestration, supporting overall ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer anhweiense is a species of maple native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In industrial contexts, its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain, making it suitable for furniture and crafts. Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty in traditional Chinese art and landscaping.</p>
<p>However, its applications remain largely limited compared to other maple species due to its restricted natural range and limited research.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer anhweiense has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Candela' and 'Variegatum', which are known for their striking foliage and compact growth. Hybrids of Acer anhweiense have been developed to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and leaf coloration. These cultivars and hybrids are important in horticulture for adding visual interest to gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Their unique characteristics make them a desirable choice for collectors and landscape designers alike.</p>
