                <h1>Acer anhweiense</h1>
<p>Acer anhweiense, commonly known as the Anhwei maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant autumn foliage, which displays shades of red, orange, and yellow. The tree has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and prefers well-drained soil in full sun.</p>
<p>This ornamental tree is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer anhweiense has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a coarsely serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, vertical strips as the tree matures. It produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, ranging in color from white to pale pink, which bloom in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind due to their light weight and elongated shape.</p>
<p>Its root system is typically shallow and fibrous, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer anhweiense is a rare tree species native to China, specifically found in the provinces of Anhui and Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the mountainous regions of eastern China. It thrives in humid, temperate environments with well-drained soil, often growing in mixed forests. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Acer anhweiense is listed as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer anhweiense is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its vibrant autumn foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with garlic or marigolds can help deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer anhweiense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting the reproductive cycles of other plants in the ecosystem. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil structure and promoting the growth of neighboring vegetation. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land and reducing sediment runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer anhweiense plays a role in carbon sequestration, helping to mitigate climate change impacts.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer anhweiense is a rare and lesser-known maple species native to China, primarily found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential nutritional value. In traditional Chinese medicine, it has been used to treat ailments such as coughs and skin conditions due to its anti-inflammatory properties. The tree's ornamental value makes it a candidate for horticultural and landscape design, contributing to its ecological and economic significance.</p>
<p>Additionally, it holds cultural importance in local communities, symbolizing resilience and natural beauty.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer anhweiense has several varieties and cultivars that are prized for their ornamental qualities, with popular cultivars like 'Cunninghamii' and 'Koehneanum' being widely cultivated for their vibrant fall colors and unique leaf shapes.</p>
<p>It has also been used in hybridization efforts to create new species with enhanced traits, such as improved cold hardiness and extended blooming periods. These hybrids often combine the aesthetic appeal of Acer anhweiense with the adaptability of other maple species. Horticulturally, Acer anhweiense is important for its role in landscape design and its contribution to genetic diversity in the maple genus.</p>
<p>Its beauty and adaptability make it a valuable addition to both public gardens and private collections.</p>
