                <h1>Acrolophia cochlearis</h1>
<p>Acrolophia cochlearis, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a species of orchid native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique spiral-shaped inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and green. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Acrolophia cochlearis is a rare and specialized orchid, adapted to specific environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrolophia cochlearis has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout its growth. Its flowers are delicate, bell-shaped structures with five petals, typically pink or red in color, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolophia cochlearis is primarily native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern and southern regions of the country. This plant typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands. It is adapted to the temperate to subtropical climates of these areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is mainly within the Cape Floristic Region, a biodiversity hotspot.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolophia cochlearis was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is believed to have been brought there accidentally through human activities, such as the transportation of contaminated soil or plant material. The plant has since become established in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It is often found in coastal dunes and sandy soils, where it thrives in sunny conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to spread rapidly, it is considered a potential environmental weed.</p>
