<p>Alnus viridis subsp.</p>
<p>suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet birch, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, aromatic bark that exudes a pleasant scent when scratched.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by oval, edible berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have serrated edges, typically turning yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>The species is also notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment.</p>
