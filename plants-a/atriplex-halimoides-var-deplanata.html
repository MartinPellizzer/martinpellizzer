                    <h1>Atriplex halimoides var. deplanata</h1>
<p>Atriplex halimoides var. deplanata, commonly known as jointed saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, contributing to its resilience in drought conditions.</p>
