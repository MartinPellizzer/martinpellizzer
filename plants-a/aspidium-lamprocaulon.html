<p>Aspidium lamprocaulon, commonly known as the shining fern, is a species of polypody fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a waxy, shiny coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous short, upright stipes.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive row along the underside of the fronds.</p>
