<p>Artemisia kaschgarica var. dshungarica, commonly known as the Karakorum wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>

The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in compact clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Its essential oils contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, though it is generally considered a hardy, low-maintenance plant for ornamental use.</p>
