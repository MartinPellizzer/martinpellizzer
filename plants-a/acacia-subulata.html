                    <h1>Acacia subulata</h1>
<p>Acacia subulata, commonly known as the needle acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like phyllodes that are typically light green to pale yellow in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Acacia subulata is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
