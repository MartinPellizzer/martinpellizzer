                    <h1>Acacia uncifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia uncifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and small, needle-like phyllodes that are typically green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads that appear in late winter to early spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Acacia uncifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its role in ecological restoration and as a source of timber and traditional medicine.</p>
