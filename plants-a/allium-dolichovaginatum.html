                    <h1>Allium dolichovaginatum</h1>
<p>Allium dolichovaginatum, commonly known as the long sheath garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces large, elongated bulbs that are often used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a complex network of rhizomes that help it thrive in harsh, arid environments.</p>
<p>Allium dolichovaginatum is closely related to other allium species, such as garlic and leeks, but is distinguished by its unique bulb structure and habitat preferences.</p>
