                <h1>Acinodendron molle</h1>
<p>Acinodendron molle, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvet tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered white or yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Acinodendron molle is often found in moist, shady environments such as forest understories and along riverbanks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron molle has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron molle is primarily native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries such as Brazil, Peru, and Colombia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in forested habitats, including secondary growth and disturbed sites. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron molle was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, particularly in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and abandoned fields where sunlight is more available. This plant has been reported in several states including Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina. Its introduction is likely due to its ability to thrive in disturbed environments and its rapid growth rate.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it has been introduced.</p>
