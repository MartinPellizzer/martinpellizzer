                    <h1>Arenaria subulata</h1>
<p>Arenaria subulata, commonly known as the needleleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers in early summer, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Its compact form and resilience make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
