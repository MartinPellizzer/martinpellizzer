                <h1>Aconitum vulgare</h1>
<p>Aconitum vulgare, commonly known as the common aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, such as aconitine, which make it highly poisonous to both animals and humans. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its striking appearance and potent toxicity make it both a notable ornamental and a dangerous plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum vulgare has large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and upright, with a smooth, slightly hairy bark that is typically greenish-brown in color. The flowers are showy, blue to purple spathaceous blooms that appear in late summer, arranged in a raceme, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that contains small, flat seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick and fleshy, often forming a taproot system that helps the plant anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
