                    <h1>Asplenium × artanense</h1>
<p>Asplenium × artanense, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and shield-shaped fronds, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its fronds are leathery and dark green, with a unique pattern of sori that are not fully developed due to its sterile nature.</p>
<p>This hybrid is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
