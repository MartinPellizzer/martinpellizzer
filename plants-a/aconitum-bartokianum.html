                <h1>Aconitum bartokianum</h1>
<p>Aconitum bartokianum, commonly known as the Bartok's monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum bartokianum has large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically have a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and erect, with a smooth, bluish-green bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, and consist of five petal-like sepals and two smaller petals, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through a spiral opening, with seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and form a dense network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
