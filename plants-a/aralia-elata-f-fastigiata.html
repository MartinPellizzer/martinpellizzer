<p>Aralia elata f. fastigiata, commonly known as the upright aralia, is a compact, shrub-like plant with a distinctive upright growth habit.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves that are narrow and elongated, giving it a unique, architectural appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is native to eastern Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
<p>This variety is more compact than the typical Aralia elata, making it suitable for smaller spaces.</p>
