                <h1>Actinophloeus guppyanus</h1>
<p>Actinophloeus guppyanus, commonly known as the Guppy's sphaerocarp, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its small, spherical fruits that resemble tiny balls, giving it its common name. It typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and coastal ecology.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus guppyanus has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellow petals and a green calyx, blooming during the wet season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in sandy or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus guppyanus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Malaysia and Papua New Guinea. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. It is often associated with rocky or coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Its native range extends to some islands in the Pacific Ocean as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus guppyanus was mainly introduced to aquatic environments in Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and rice paddies. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats on the water surface. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species and alter local ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is often considered an invasive species in regions where it has been introduced.</p>
