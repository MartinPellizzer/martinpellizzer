                <h1>Achyranthes divaricata</h1>
<p>Achyranthes divaricata, commonly known as Indian knotgrass, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste lands.</p>
<p>Its adaptability and rapid growth make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes divaricata has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually 3–8 cm long and 1–3 cm wide, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and a dark green upper surface with a pale underside.</p>
<p>The stems are cylindrical, slightly hairy, and have a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough and fissured with age. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, with a wind-pollination method. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively.</p>
