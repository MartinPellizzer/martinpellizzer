                    <h1>Androsace diapensia</h1>
<p>Androsace diapensia, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
