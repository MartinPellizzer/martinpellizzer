<p>Abies guatemalensis subsp.</p>
<p>jaliscana, commonly known as the Jalisco fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the highlands of Jalisco, Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like foliage.</p>
<p>The plant exhibits distinct morphological differences from the typical *A. guatemalensis*, including shorter cones and a more compact growth habit. It thrives in cool, moist environments at elevations between 2,000 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
