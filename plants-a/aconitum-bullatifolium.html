                <h1>Aconitum bullatifolium</h1>
<p>Aconitum bullatifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense spires. Its leaves are large, palmately divided, and often have a waxy texture.</p>
<p>Aconitum bullatifolium is part of the Ranunculaceae family and contains potent alkaloids, making it toxic to both animals and humans.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum bullatifolium has large, compound leaves that are palmately arranged, with each leaflet being ovate to lanceolate in shape, typically measuring up to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a hairy texture. The stem is upright, smooth, and somewhat woody, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in racemes, and consist of five petal-like sepals and two showy petals, blooming in late summer; they are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum bullatifolium is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often found in rocky soils at high elevations. This plant is commonly associated with areas of the Tien Shan and Pamir mountain ranges. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and forested slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and localized in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum bullatifolium was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. This plant has become established in wildlands and is often encountered in naturalized areas. Its introduction is largely attributed to garden escapes and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in gardens but has since spread into the wild.</p>
