                    <h1>Achyropsis</h1>
<p>Achyropsis, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in South Africa. They are characterized by their erect, branching stems and small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer. Achyropsis species are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Their leaves are typically small and often covered in a fine layer of hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
