                <h1>Adenandra ovata</h1>
<p>Adenandra ovata, commonly known as the silver tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. These flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and the plant is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Adenandra ovata is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra ovata has simple, ovate-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom during the spring and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra ovata is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the region of the Eastern Cape Province. The plant thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils. It is commonly found in the fynbos biome.</p>
<p>Adenandra ovata is also present in parts of Namibia and into eastern South Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra ovata was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it is commonly found in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated in gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. The species is also present in some parts of Zimbabwe and Mozambique, where it has been introduced for horticultural purposes.
