                    <h1>Arenaria pleurantha</h1>
<p>Arenaria pleurantha, commonly known as the clustered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which reduces water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Arenaria pleurantha is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a common sight in tundra and mountainous areas.</p>
