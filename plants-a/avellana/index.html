                            <h1>Avellana</h1>
<p>The avellana, also known as the hazelnut tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is valued for its edible nuts, which are rich in nutrients and widely used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces small, green leaves and catkins that bloom in early spring. Its compact size makes it suitable for both ornamental and agricultural purposes. The avellana has been cultivated for thousands of years and remains an important crop in many parts of the world.</p>
