<p>Acianthera phrynoglossa, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that resemble horns. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive lip that is elongated and curled.</p>
<p>Acianthera phrynoglossa is a terrestrial orchid that produces small, greenish leaves and has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera phrynoglossa has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. Its flowers are tubular with a distinctive hood-like structure, typically violet to purple in color, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera phrynoglossa is primarily native to Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is found in the Andean regions of the country, particularly in the western and central highlands. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded forest environments at moderate elevations. It is often associated with cloud forests and misty mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat is characterized by rich soil and a cool, moist climate.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera phrynoglossa was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. This plant is often found in areas with high biodiversity and complex ecosystems. Its introduction has been documented in several countries in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in horticultural settings outside its native range.</p>
