<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon braunii has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with short, soft hairs, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age. Its flowers are clustered in panicles, featuring five pink to reddish-purple petals, and bloom during the summer months; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a hairy, spiny capsule that splits open to release small, flat, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in dry, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon braunii is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to specific areas within its native range. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as cloud forests and mountainous regions. Abutilon braunii is typically found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon braunii is a fast-growing, shrub-like plant known for its velvety leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method. The plant has a warm-season growth cycle, thriving in spring and summer, and entering dormancy in colder months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant and promote flowering are recommended.
