<p>Albizia pubigera, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, which bloom during the wet season. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, pod-like fruits that split open when mature.</p>
<p>Albizia pubigera is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits in its native habitats.</p>
