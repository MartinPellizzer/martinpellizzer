                <h1>Achillea clavennae</h1>
<p>Achillea clavennae, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and small, pale yellow to white composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and wildflower meadows.</p>
<p>Its historical use in medicine and as a traditional remedy for wounds and ailments adds to its cultural significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae has basal leaves that are narrow, linear to lanceolate in shape, with a gray-green color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-gray bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green composite heads with a flat structure, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry achene enclosed in a pappus of feathery bristles, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in dry, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Italy, France, Spain, and the Canary Islands, where it thrives in rocky and gravelly soils. This plant prefers sunny, dry environments and is commonly found in scrublands and open woodlands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea clavennae is listed as a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae is a hardy perennial plant known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late fall, ensuring healthy growth and genetic diversity. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering that can lead to root rot.</p>
<p>Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring supports robust growth, while light pruning after flowering helps maintain shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper spacing and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter harmful pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both nectar and shelter in its dense foliage. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. Additionally, its deep root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in dry or rocky environments.</p>
<p>Achillea clavennae also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil structure.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
