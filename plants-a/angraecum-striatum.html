                    <h1>Angraecum striatum</h1>
<p>Angraecum striatum, commonly known as the star orchid, is a rare and exquisite species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue with a dark purple throat. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are pollinated by the hawkmoth *Xanthoparia inanis*, which has a long proboscis adapted to reach the nectar deep within the blooms.</p>
<p>Angraecum striatum is highly valued in horticulture for its beauty and rarity, making it a sought-after specimen among orchid enthusiasts.</p>
