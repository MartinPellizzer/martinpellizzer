                    <h1>Andropogon paniceus</h1>
<p>Andropogon paniceus, commonly known as switchgrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the central and eastern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions, including poor and disturbed sites. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Switchgrass is known for its high biomass yield and is widely used in conservation plantings and as a potential bioenergy crop.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots also help prevent soil erosion and improve soil structure.</p>
