<p>Agropyron biflorum subsp.</p>
<p>andinum, commonly known as the Andean needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that are often clustered in pairs.</p>
<p>The plant typically thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing mountainous terrains and its potential for use in restoration projects.</p>
