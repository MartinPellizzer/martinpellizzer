                    <h1>Athyrium oligosorum</h1>
<p>Athyrium oligosorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
