                    <h1>Arabis stolonifera</h1>
<p>Arabis stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of oblong, toothed leaves and produces clusters of small, white or yellow flowers in early spring. The plant spreads via stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to colonize rocky or gravelly soils. It is often found in alpine meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Arabis stolonifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
