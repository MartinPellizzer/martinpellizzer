                        <h1>Acaena ovalifolia var. tenerrima</h1>
<p>Acaena ovalifolia var. tenerrima, commonly known as the slender burr bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces oval, hooked fruits that contain seeds covered in hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. It thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a stabilizing plant in erosion-prone areas.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena ovalifolia var. tenerrima is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the South Island, particularly in the central and southern regions. This variety thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often in sandy or gravelly soils. It is commonly associated with disturbed sites and can be found along roadsides and in open vegetation.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate of New Zealand.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena ovalifolia var. tenerrima was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant's rapid spread has led to its classification as a noxious weed in several regions.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its distribution and mitigate its ecological impact.</p>
