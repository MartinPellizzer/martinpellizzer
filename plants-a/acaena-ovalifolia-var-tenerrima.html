                    <h1>Acaena ovalifolia var. tenerrima</h1>
<p>Acaena ovalifolia var. tenerrima, commonly known as the slender burr bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces oval, hooked fruits that contain seeds covered in hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. It thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a stabilizing plant in erosion-prone areas.</p>
