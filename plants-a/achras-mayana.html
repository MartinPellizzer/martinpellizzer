                <h1>Achras mayana</h1>
<p>Achras mayana, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, canoe-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that develop into fleshy, spiny fruits. The fruit, which is botanically classified as a syncarp, matures from green to yellow or orange and has a starchy, bread-like texture when cooked. It belongs to the family Moraceae and is closely related to the fig and mulberry trees.</p>
<p>The plant is widely cultivated for its nutritional value and has cultural significance in many Pacific Island societies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras mayana has large, palm-like leaves that are fan-shaped, arranged in a basal rosette, and can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, with a dark green, leathery texture and a bluish-white underside.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright from the base. The plant produces large, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a large, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, anchoring the plant and helping it survive in dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras mayana is a tropical plant native to Central America, particularly found in countries like Mexico and Guatemala.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Caribbean and some regions of South America, where it has been introduced. It thrives in humid, tropical climates, often growing in lowland areas near rivers or in dense forests. Acras mayana typically grows at altitudes between 0 and 600 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered threatened in some regions, though its conservation status varies across its range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras mayana is a tropical plant known for its rapid growth and ornamental value, often cultivated for its large, waxy leaves and edible fruits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or grafting, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a fast growth cycle, reaching maturity in about 12 to 18 months under optimal conditions. It thrives in well-draining, fertile soil and requires regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to encourage bushier growth are recommended, while pests like aphids and diseases such as root rot can be managed with proper care and companion plants like marigolds or basil.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achras mayana is a tropical plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing the growth of neighboring crops. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion and improve soil structure.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achras mayana contributes to biodiversity by offering a habitat and food source in its native ecosystems.</p>
