<p>Artemisia commutata var. richardsoniana, commonly known as Richardson's wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish-green flower heads that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and meadows, and it is well adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is often used in herbal medicine and has a long history of traditional use by Indigenous peoples.</p>
