                <h1>Acer subpedatum</h1>
<p>Acer subpedatum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, red flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It typically grows to a height of 20 to 40 feet and prefers moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Acer subpedatum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often planted in gardens and urban landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer subpedatum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically bright green during the growing season and turn yellow in the autumn. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer subpedatum is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of western North America, specifically found in parts of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Range. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes, typically at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Acer subpedatum is classified as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer subpedatum is a rare and attractive maple species known for its unique foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining cultivar traits. The growth cycle of Acer subpedatum involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be done in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and pruning is minimal, focusing on shaping and removing dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ornamental grasses or flowering shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer subpedatum is a small deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in nutrient cycling by improving soil quality through leaf litter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer subpedatum is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited culinary use due to its small, bitter fruits, though it is occasionally used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
<p>It has medicinal applications in some indigenous cultures, where its leaves and bark may be used for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, it contributes to local biodiversity and supports wildlife, but it has minimal economic value compared to other maple species. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions, representing resilience and natural heritage.</p>
<p>Overall, its role is more ecological and traditional than commercially prominent.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer subpedatum has a limited number of naturally occurring varieties, but it is primarily known for its ornamental value rather than extensive horticultural cultivation.</p>
<p>Some popular cultivars include 'Aureum' and 'Variegatum', which are appreciated for their striking leaf coloration. While there are few documented hybrids of Acer subpedatum, crossbreeding with related maples has occasionally produced unique forms. Its horticultural importance lies mainly in its potential for introducing new color and texture to woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it remains a less common choice for gardeners.</p>
