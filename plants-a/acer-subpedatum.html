                <h1>Acer subpedatum</h1>
<p>Acer subpedatum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in autumn, which makes it a popular ornamental species. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn brilliant shades of red, orange, and yellow in the fall. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>Acer subpedatum typically grows to a height of 15 to 30 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer subpedatum has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with ovate to elliptical leaflets that are typically 2â€“5 cm in length, featuring a serrated margin and a glossy dark green upper surface that turns reddish in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a shrub-like growth pattern. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences during late spring, with separate male and female flowers, and it is wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, and the plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize it in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer subpedatum is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, specifically in the provinces of Hubei, Sichuan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including the United States, where it is cultivated in botanical gardens and arboreta. It thrives in temperate climates, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils within shaded to semi-shaded forest environments. This species is commonly found at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from habitat loss, Acer subpedatum is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer subpedatum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer subpedatum includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by summer foliage and autumn coloration before entering dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization should be done in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, while pruning is best performed in late winter to shape the tree and remove dead or diseased branches.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues like aphids or powdery mildew, and it benefits from companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants to enhance soil fertility.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer subpedatum is a native plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in native plant gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and offering habitat for small animals.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer subpedatum is a lesser-known maple species that has limited direct culinary use but is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>Its sap, though not commonly harvested, may have minor industrial applications in natural product formulations. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions where it is associated with resilience and local biodiversity. Economically, it contributes to ecological restoration projects and supports local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Overall, its role is more ecological and symbolic than practical in everyday use.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer subpedatum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Autumn Flame,' which are prized for their vibrant fall colors and compact growth habit. Hybrids of Acer subpedatum are often created to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and disease resistance. These cultivars and hybrids play an important role in horticulture, particularly in landscaping and garden design.</p>
<p>Their aesthetic appeal and adaptability make them popular choices for both residential and public landscapes.</p>
