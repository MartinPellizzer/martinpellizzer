<p>Acacia sulitii, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in compact clusters. The plant produces small, oval-shaped pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Acacia sulitii thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various coastal organisms.</p>
