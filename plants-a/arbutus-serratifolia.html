<p>Arbutus serratifolia, commonly known as the coastal evergreen or the leatherleaf shrub, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the western coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, leathery leaves with serrated edges, which help reduce water loss in its coastal habitat. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Arbutus serratifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native range.</p>
