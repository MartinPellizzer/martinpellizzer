                    <h1>Ajuga campylanthoides var. subacaulis</h1>
<p>Ajuga campylanthoides var. subacaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bugleweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its reduced stem structure and compact growth form compared to other ajuga species.</p>
