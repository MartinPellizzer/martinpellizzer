                        <h1>Acantholimon fasciculare</h1>
<p>Acantholimon fasciculare, commonly known as the clustered stonecress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Acantholimon fasciculare is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acantholimon fasciculare belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and their close relatives, characterized by their complex cellular structures and ability to perform photosynthesis. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and diverse reproductive strategies. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a large group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species, such as roses and magnolias.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes plants like carnations and beets, often characterized by their distinctive floral structures. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, a family of flowering plants commonly known as the leadwort family, which includes plants with showy flowers and often adapted to arid environments. Its genus is Acantholimon, a group of flowering plants typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, known for their spiny or hairy leaves.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon fasciculare, a specific plant within the genus Acantholimon, characterized by its clustered growth habit and adaptations to dry environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon fasciculare is primarily native to Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these countries. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often in mountainous or foothill areas. The species is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays a role in the local flora and is part of the broader biodiversity of Central Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon fasciculare was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of Mediterranean flora during the 19th century. The plant has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in coastal and subalpine areas. It is often found in gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Despite its introduction, it is not considered invasive and plays a minor role in local ecosystems.</p>
