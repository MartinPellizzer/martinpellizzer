                    <h1>Aetanthus cauliflorus</h1>
<p>Aetanthus cauliflorus, commonly known as the cauliflower orchid, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, where flowers develop directly on the stem rather than at the ends of branches, a trait known as cauliflorous growth. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers, which are often surrounded by modified leaves. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticultural and ecological studies.</p>
<p>Aetanthus cauliflorus is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories.</p>
