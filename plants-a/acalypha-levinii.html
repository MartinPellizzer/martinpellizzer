<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Acalypha levinii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and adaptability to various climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha levinii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and exhibits a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with a yellowish-green color and a structure that includes both stamens and pistils; they bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed schizocarp, dispersing its seeds by wind after maturity.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to absorb nutrients efficiently from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha levinii is a flowering plant native to the island of New Guinea, specifically found in the highland regions of Papua.</p>
<p>It is now also present in parts of Indonesia, particularly in the Moluccas, where it has been introduced. This species thrives in tropical rainforests and moist, shaded environments, often growing near streams or in undergrowth. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Acalypha levinii is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status due to its relatively stable population and limited threats.</p>
