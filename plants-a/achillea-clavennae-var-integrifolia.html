                <h1>Achillea clavennae var. integrifolia</h1>
<p>Achillea clavennae var. integrifolia, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of finely divided, gray-green leaves that are entire or slightly lobed. The plant produces flat, composite flower heads in shades of white to pale pink, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae var. integrifolia has leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a grayish-green color, with a branching growth pattern that develops from the base. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried over short distances.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and establish in rocky or dry environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae var. integrifolia is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Spain, Italy, and the Canary Islands, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. This plant prefers arid or semi-arid environments and is commonly found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae var. integrifolia is a hardy perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and delicate yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a dormant growth cycle, going through active growth in spring and blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and attract beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae var. integrifolia is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds and foliage for sustenance. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its ability to suppress weeds and improve soil structure. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil in rocky or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by supporting a wide range of insect and animal life in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae var. integrifolia is a lesser-known member of the sunflower family with limited culinary use due to its bitter taste and potential toxicity.</p>
<p>Historically, it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and wound-healing properties. While it has minimal industrial applications, its ornamental value makes it a candidate for horticultural use in certain regions. Culturally, it is not widely recognized for symbolic meaning, though it shares lineage with more famous chamomile varieties.</p>
<p>Overall, its role remains largely ecological and niche, with further research needed to explore its full potential.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae var. integrifolia has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Avalanche' and 'Snowcap', which are known for their dense, white flower heads and hardy nature.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly hybridized due to its specific genetic makeup, it can occasionally be crossed with other Achillea species to produce plants with enhanced traits. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in sunny, well-drained soils and its long-lasting blooms. Its resilience and aesthetic appeal make it a favored choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea clavennae var. integrifolia holds significant horticultural importance as a reliable and visually appealing perennial.</p>
