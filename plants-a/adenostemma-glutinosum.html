                    <h1>Adenostemma glutinosum</h1>
<p>Adenostemma glutinosum, commonly known as sticky milkweed, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems that are often covered in a sticky, glandular resin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and also coated with a sticky substance. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The sticky secretions on its stems and leaves may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and pathogens.</p>
