                <h1>Adenostemma glutinosum</h1>
<p>Adenostemma glutinosum, commonly known as sticky milkweed, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems that are often covered in a sticky, glandular resin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and also coated with a sticky substance. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The sticky secretions on its stems and leaves may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and pathogens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma glutinosum has ovate to lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a rough, hairy texture on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age, and it grows in a bushy pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with pink to reddish petals, blooming from summer to autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant establish quickly in disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma glutinosum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, riverbanks, and open forests. This plant thrives in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils. It is often considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with human activity due to its ability to spread through seeds carried by wind and water.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma glutinosum was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced through human activities, such as accidental transport on vehicles or equipment. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can rapidly colonize open spaces. Its spread has raised concerns due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and prevent further ecological damage.</p>
