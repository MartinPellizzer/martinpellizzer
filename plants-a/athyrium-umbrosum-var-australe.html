                    <h1>Athyrium umbrosum var. australe</h1>
<p>Athyrium umbrosum var. australe, commonly known as the Australian shade fern, is a species native to Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the Athyriaceae family.</p>
