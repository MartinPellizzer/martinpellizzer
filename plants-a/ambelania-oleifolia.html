<p>Ambelania oleifolia, commonly known as the oilleaf ambelania, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of oils, which help to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Ambelania oleifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
