                <h1>Acinodendron miocarpum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron miocarpum, commonly known as the Miocene fruit tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically orange or red in color. Its leaves are alternate and have a rough texture, often with a waxy coating.</p>
<p>Acinodendron miocarpum is of interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance and potential ecological roles in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron miocarpum has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5-10 cm in length with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, light gray bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and dispersal occurs mainly through animal consumption and seed shedding.</p>
<p>The root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron miocarpum is primarily native to the western regions of Africa, specifically countries such as Nigeria, Cameroon, and Gabon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforest habitats within these areas. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. It is often encountered in secondary growth forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the ecological conditions of the Atlantic rainforest biome.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron miocarpum was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique fruit structure. It has also been introduced to some parts of the Pacific Islands for landscaping purposes.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited due to specific environmental requirements and potential competition with native species.</p>
