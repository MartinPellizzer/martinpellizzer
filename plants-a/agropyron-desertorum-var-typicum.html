                    <h1>Agropyron desertorum var. typicum</h1>
<p>Agropyron desertorum var. typicum, commonly known as the desert wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense, mat-like growth habit, which helps it thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>This species is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soils in degraded landscapes.</p>
