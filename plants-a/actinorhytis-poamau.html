<p>Actinorhytis poamau, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a distinctive member of the Cyatheaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a thick, fibrous trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in moist, shaded environments. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Native to New Zealand, it plays an important ecological role in its natural habitat.</p>
