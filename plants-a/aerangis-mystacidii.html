                    <h1>Aerangis mystacidii</h1>
<p>Aerangis mystacidii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like structures and its striking, white, ghost-like flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
