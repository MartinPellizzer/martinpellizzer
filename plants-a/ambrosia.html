                    <h1>Ambrosia</h1>
<p>Ambrosia, commonly known as ragweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hairless leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. Ambrosia species are often invasive and are known for producing large amounts of allergenic pollen, which can cause hay fever in humans. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a challenging weed to control.</p>
