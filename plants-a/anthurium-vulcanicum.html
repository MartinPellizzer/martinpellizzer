<p>Anthurium vulcanicum, commonly known as the Vulcanian arrowhead, is a striking tropical plant native to the volcanic regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are inflorescences that resemble an arrowhead, giving it its common name. These spadices are usually bright red or orange, contrasting vividly with the green foliage.</p>
<p>Anthurium vulcanicum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
