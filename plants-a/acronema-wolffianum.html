                <h1>Acronema wolffianum</h1>
<p>Acronema wolffianum, commonly known as the Wolffian acronema, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae, also known as the carrot or parsley family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. Native to certain regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronema wolffianum has small, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually green and have a smooth surface, with a slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and often creeping along the ground, with a light green color and a smooth texture. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema wolffianum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments like rainforests and along stream banks. This plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is often associated with dense vegetation. It is not found in other continents and is restricted to its native range in Africa.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to specific ecological niches within its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema wolffianum was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It has since spread to other areas, including parts of southern Europe and the Middle East. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas have led to its establishment in both natural and urban environments.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions due to its competitive nature.</p>
