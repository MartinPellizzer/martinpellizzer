                    <h1>Acronema wolffianum</h1>
<p>Acronema wolffianum, commonly known as the Wolffian acronema, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae, also known as the carrot or parsley family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. Native to certain regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices.</p>
