                        <h1>Abies fraseri</h1>
<p>Abies fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the stems. The cones of the Fraser fir are typically slender and elongated, with short, sticky bracts that help in seed dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found at high elevations where the climate is temperate and humid.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in the Christmas tree industry.</p>

<p>This species is commonly found in the Appalachian Mountains region of these states. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. The plant is typically found in forested areas, often growing at higher elevations.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely tied to the specific environmental conditions of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies fraseri was mainly introduced to Great Britain as an ornamental tree due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to temperate climates.</p>
<p>It was popular in horticulture for its conical shape, dark green needles, and occasional white bark. The introduction of Abies fraseri to Great Britain occurred during the 19th century, primarily through botanical exchanges and garden introductions. It has since been cultivated in parks, gardens, and landscaped areas across the country.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in Great Britain and is generally managed as a non-native species.</p>
