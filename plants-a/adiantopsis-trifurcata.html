<p>Adiantopsis trifurcata, commonly known as the fork-veined maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically pale green to bluish-green in color. The plant features a unique, branching pattern in its vascular system, which contributes to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a trait that aids in its nocturnal pollination by certain insects.</p>
