                    <h1>Asclepias lactifera</h1>
<p>Asclepias lactifera, commonly known as the milkweed of the desert, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It plays a crucial role in supporting the life cycle of the monarch butterfly, as its leaves are a primary food source for monarch caterpillars.</p>
<p>Asclepias lactifera is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in drought conditions.</p>
