                    <h1>Aster limicola</h1>
<p>Aster limicola, commonly known as the marsh aster, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its wetland environment.</p>
<p>Aster limicola plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems.</p>
