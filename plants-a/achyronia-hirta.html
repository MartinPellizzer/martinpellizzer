                <h1>Achyronia hirta</h1>
<p>Achyronia hirta, commonly known as the hairy achyronia, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>Achyronia hirta is often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia hirta has leaves that are simple, lanceolate in shape, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish with five petals and are pollinated by insects, blooming from late spring to early summer. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia hirta is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico. This plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments, often in coastal areas or near freshwater sources. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the warm, wet climate of its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a regional endemic species within the Caribbean.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia hirta was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall and full sun exposure. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas quickly. Its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native species in invaded regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the eastern United States and has been reported in several European countries as well.</p>
