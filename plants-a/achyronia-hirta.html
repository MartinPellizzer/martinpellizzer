                <h1>Achyronia hirta</h1>
<p>Achyronia hirta, commonly known as the hairy achyronia, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warmer climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia hirta has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dull green color and a hairy texture on both surfaces.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a light green to brownish color, with an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with yellow petals and a green calyx, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia hirta is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in countries such as Spain, France, and Italy.</p>
<p>While its native range is primarily in southern Europe, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including North America and Australia, where it is now cultivated or occasionally naturalized. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in open woodlands, shrublands, and coastal areas. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level up to 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, Achyronia hirta is not considered endangered, but its distribution is limited and it faces threats from habitat loss and invasive species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achyronia hirta is a hardy, herbaceous plant known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with seed propagation often yielding the most consistent results. The plant has a dormant growth cycle, typically going through active growth in spring and early summer, followed by a rest period in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization should be done in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>
