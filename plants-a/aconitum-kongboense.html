<p>Aconitum kongboense, commonly known as the Tibetan monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that resemble a hood, hence its common name. The plant has dark green, palmately divided leaves and produces showy, spicate inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a poisonous plant and requires careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum kongboense has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, and they are typically large, reaching up to 30 cm in diameter.</p>
