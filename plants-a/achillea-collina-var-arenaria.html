                        <h1>Achillea collina var. arenaria</h1>
<p>Achillea collina var. arenaria, commonly known as sand yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its wiry, grass-like leaves and flat, composite flower heads that range from white to pale yellow. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant. It produces small, herbaceous stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Sand yarrow is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
