                <h1>Adenopodia polystachia</h1>
<p>Adenopodia polystachia, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or white. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Adenopodia polystachia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenopodia polystachia has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that are usually green and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly reddish-brown in color, with a climbing growth pattern that often involves twining around supports. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>
