<p>Acantholimon echinus f. distica, commonly known as the two-leaved acantholimon, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, spiny leaves. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its ornamental value and resilience to harsh environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon echinus f. distica is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Turkey.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in open slopes and among shrubs. It is particularly associated with the Taurus and Pontic mountain ranges.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
