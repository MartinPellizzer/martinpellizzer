                <h1>Acinodendron annulatum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron annulatum, commonly known as the ringed acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often arranged in a ring-like structure around the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron annulatum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale grey bark that exudes a mild scent when scratched. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and enabling the plant to thrive in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron annulatum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in forested environments, often growing as an understory species in evergreen and semi-evergreen forests. It is also present in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron annulatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, showy flowers.</p>
<p>It was brought to these regions during the late 19th and early 20th centuries by horticulturists and gardeners seeking to diversify local flora. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in coastal and disturbed habitats, often spreading through seed dispersal by wind and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
