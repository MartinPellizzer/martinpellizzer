<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon pleiopodum has broad, ovate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem, with a waxy green surface and a slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and somewhat woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are showy, with five petals forming a cup-shaped structure, and they bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting insects through their yellow-orange color. The fruit is a蒴果 (capsule) that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to absorb moisture efficiently from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon pleiopodum is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries like Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is currently found in fragmented habitats across the Andes, with populations primarily concentrated in cloud forests and dry shrublands. This plant thrives in humid, temperate environments with well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Abutilon pleiopodum is considered endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
