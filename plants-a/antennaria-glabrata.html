                    <h1>Antennaria glabrata</h1>
<p>Antennaria glabrata, commonly known as the smooth sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cushion-like growth form, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Antennaria glabrata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its fragile habitats.</p>
