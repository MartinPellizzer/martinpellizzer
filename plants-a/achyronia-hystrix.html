                <h1>Achyronia hystrix</h1>
<p>Achyronia hystrix, commonly known as the spiked achyronia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, spiny stems and showy, pentagonal flowers that are typically pink or purple. Its leaves are ovate with prominent veins and are covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Achyronia hystrix is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia hystrix has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in fine, white hairs, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellow petals and prominent stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia hystrix is primarily native to the Caribbean region, particularly the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical environments, often in coastal areas or near freshwater sources. It is commonly associated with dry to moist forests and is often found in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific islands where the climate and soil conditions support its growth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia hystrix was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its unique and striking appearance.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the country in the early 20th century by horticulturists who admired its exotic foliage. Despite its aesthetic appeal, the plant has shown invasive tendencies in certain regions, particularly in the southeastern United States. It spreads rapidly through seeds and can outcompete native vegetation in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its potential ecological impact, it is now considered a noxious weed in several states.</p>
