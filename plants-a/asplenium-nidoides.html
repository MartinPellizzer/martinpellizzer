                    <h1>Asplenium nidoides</h1>
<p>Asplenium nidoides, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and typically grows on trees or rocks. Its rhizomes form a dense, moss-like mat that helps anchor it to its substrate.</p>
<p>Asplenium nidoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
