                <h1>Acroptilon picris</h1>
<p>Acroptilon picris, commonly known as yellow star-thistle, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a star. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by spiny, bract-covered seed heads. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Acroptilon picris is often considered a weed due to its invasive nature and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acroptilon picris has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 3 to 8 cm in length, with a bright green color and slightly hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat woody, and covered with fine hairs, growing in a bushy pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets and brown disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroptilon picris is primarily native to Central Asia, including regions such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and parts of Russia.</p>
<p>It is also found in northern China, particularly in the Xinjiang region. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in grasslands and along dry riverbanks. Its distribution extends into western Mongolia and southern Siberia.</p>
<p>It is commonly associated with disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroptilon picris was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered an invasive species in several western states. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns. Its rapid growth and seed production contribute to its ability to colonize new areas quickly.</p>
<p>Efforts to control its spread include mechanical removal and the use of herbicides in affected regions.</p>
