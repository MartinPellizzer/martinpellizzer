                    <h1>Acroptilon picris</h1>
<p>Acroptilon picris, commonly known as yellow star-thistle, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a star. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by spiny, bract-covered seed heads. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Acroptilon picris is often considered a weed due to its invasive nature and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
