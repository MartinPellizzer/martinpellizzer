                        <h1>Acalypha lagascana</h1>
<p>Acalypha lagascana, commonly known as the red-flowered spurflower, is a species of flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its striking red bracts that surround small yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a slightly waxy appearance.</p>
<p>Acalypha lagascana is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha lagascana belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which includes ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that typically have separate male and female flowers and are often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large and diverse group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species such as coffee and cotton. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse morphologies and some containing toxic compounds. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cudweed," characterized by their showy flowers and often hairy leaves.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha lagascana, a specific plant within the genus Acalypha, known for its distinctive appearance and native to certain regions of South America.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha lagascana is primarily native to Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of this area. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly seen in desert environments. It is adapted to the harsh climate of the region with its drought-resistant characteristics.</p>
<p>This species is an important part of the local flora in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha lagascana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturalists and gardeners seeking exotic plants for landscaping purposes. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction have contributed to its establishment in non-native habitats.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now underway to control its spread and protect native biodiversity.</p>
