<p>Acanthosphaera ulei, commonly known as the horned sphere alga, is a type of marine algae belonging to the class Cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique spherical shape with prominent, spiky projections called acanthi. This organism is often found in coastal waters and is known for its ability to thrive in both freshwater and saltwater environments. Acanthosphaera ulei plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to primary production through photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and reproductive mechanisms make it an interesting subject for studies in marine botany.</p>
