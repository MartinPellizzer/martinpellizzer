<p>It features erect, cylindrical stalks with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of spikelets that bear small, two-lobed flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a valuable crop for grain production. Its botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and a robust stem that supports its heavy grain heads.</p>
