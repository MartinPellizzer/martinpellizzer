                    <h1>Angraecum schiedei</h1>
<p>Angraecum schiedei, commonly known as the star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white or pale blue flowers that bloom at night. The plant has specialized pollination mechanisms, relying on the hawkmoth *Xanthopan morganii* for cross-pollination. Its flowers have a unique structure with long, tubular nectar-rich spurs that match the moth's proboscis.</p>
<p>Angraecum schiedei is a symbol of evolutionary adaptation and has gained popularity in horticulture due to its beauty and rarity.</p>
