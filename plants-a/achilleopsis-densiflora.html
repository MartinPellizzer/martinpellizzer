                <h1>Achilleopsis densiflora</h1>
<p>Achilleopsis densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered achillea, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achilleopsis densiflora has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green to brownish bark that becomes more rugged with age, and it exhibits a bushy growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when the capsule matures and splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively and anchor itself in moist, shaded habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achilleopsis densiflora is primarily native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Western Cape region, where it thrives in coastal and sandy soils. This species is also present in parts of Namibia and Botswana. It grows in open habitats such as fynbos vegetation and along the coastlines.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely restricted to these specific geographic areas within southern Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achilleopsis densiflora was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and moist environments, often as a result of human activity such as agriculture and land development.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, riverbanks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. This plant has become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native species for resources. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes contribute to its success in new environments.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is now considered a potential weed in several parts of the world.</p>
