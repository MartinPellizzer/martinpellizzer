                    <h1>Arundo gracilis</h1>
<p>Arundo gracilis, commonly known as slender reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that can grow up to 6 feet in height. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers in dense panicles during the summer months. It thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
