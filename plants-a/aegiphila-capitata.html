                <h1>Aegiphila capitata</h1>
<p>Aegiphila capitata, commonly known as the clustered aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or violet in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila capitata has leaves that are lanceolate, arranged in a basal rosette, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a silver-gray color due to dense pubescence.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and smooth, with a reddish-brown color, exhibiting a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense terminal heads, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through dehiscence, with seeds dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the arid environments where the plant typically grows.</p>
