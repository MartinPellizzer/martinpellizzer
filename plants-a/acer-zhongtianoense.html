                <h1>Acer zhongtianoense</h1>
<p>Acer zhongtianoense, commonly known as the Zhongtian maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The plant belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is known for its ornamental value in horticulture. It typically grows to a height of 10-15 meters and prefers well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and urban landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer zhongtianoense has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and a size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, turning bright red in the fall. The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it exhibits a straight, upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, with a wind pollination method.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky and well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer zhongtianoense is a rare and critically endangered species native to the mountainous regions of central China, specifically in Sichuan Province.</p>
<p>It is currently known to occur in very limited areas, primarily in the Hengduan Mountains. This plant thrives in moist, temperate forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Its habitat is characterized by cool, shaded conditions with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Acer zhongtianoense is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer zhongtianoense is a striking maple species known for its vibrant autumn foliage and unique ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seed propagation requiring stratification to break dormancy. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture levels, requiring regular watering during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and annual pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigolds can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer zhongtianoense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting ecosystem health. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and promoting the growth of other plant species. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for land restoration projects.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality through photosynthesis.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer zhongtianoense is a rare maple species native to China, primarily known for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and unique morphology.</p>
