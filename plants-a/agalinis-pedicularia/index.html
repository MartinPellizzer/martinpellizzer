                            <h1>Agalinis Pedicularia</h1>
<p>Agalinis, scientifically known as Agalinis pedicularia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is commonly referred to as the "whorled milkweed" due to its distinctive arrangement of leaves and milky sap. This annual plant thrives in sandy soils and open habitats, often found in disturbed areas like roadsides and fields. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study. Despite its beauty, it faces threats from habitat loss and invasive species.</p>
