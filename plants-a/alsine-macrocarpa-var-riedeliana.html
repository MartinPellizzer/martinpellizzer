                    <h1>Alsine macrocarpa var. riedeliana</h1>
<p>Alsine macrocarpa var. riedeliana, commonly known as the Riedel's sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, succulent stems that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
