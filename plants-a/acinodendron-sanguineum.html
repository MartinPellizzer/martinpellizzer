                <h1>Acinodendron sanguineum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron sanguineum, commonly known as the bloodwood tree, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive red or pink bark, which gives it its common name. The tree can grow up to 15 meters tall, with a dense canopy and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in dry forests and savannas, adapting well to arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron sanguineum has leaves that are simple, elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron sanguineum is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, warm climates with high rainfall, typically found in lowland and hill forest areas. This plant is commonly encountered in secondary growth and disturbed forest sites due to its adaptability. It plays a significant role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>However, its natural range is becoming increasingly fragmented due to deforestation and habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron sanguineum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks, where it forms dense undergrowth. This plant has been introduced to several regions in Southeast Asia, including parts of Malaysia and Indonesia. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative propagation make it a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and medicinal properties.</p>
