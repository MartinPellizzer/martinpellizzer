The plant produces delicate, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
