                    <h1>Acnida cannabina var. salicifolia</h1>
<p>Acnida cannabina var. salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaved hempvine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and alternate leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a serrated margin. The leaves are typically pubescent, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance, and they often resemble the leaves of willow trees, hence its common name. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by cylindrical, woody fruits containing several seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as forest edges and stream banks.</p>
