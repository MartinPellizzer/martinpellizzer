                <h1>Acilepis dendigulensis</h1>
<p>Acilepis dendigulensis, commonly known as the giant forest tree, is a unique species native to the dense tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its towering height, often exceeding 50 meters, and its broad, umbrella-like canopy that provides significant shade. The plant possesses a thick, fibrous bark that offers protection against pests and environmental stressors. Its leaves are large, leathery, and arranged in a spiral pattern, contributing to efficient photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Acilepis dendigulensis plays a crucial role in its ecosystem by supporting a diverse array of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis dendigulensis has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate leaflets that are typically 5â€“10 cm in length, dark green on top, and slightly hairy underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as an upright shrub. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis dendigulensis is primarily native to India and Myanmar.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It typically grows in forested areas and is often associated with moist, shaded environments. Acilepis dendigulensis is a rare species with a limited natural range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is restricted to specific ecological niches within its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis dendigulensis was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high sunlight exposure and moderate rainfall. This plant is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and degraded forests. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including land clearing and urban development.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has spread to various regions outside its native range.</p>
