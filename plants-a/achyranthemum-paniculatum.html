                <h1>Achyranthemum paniculatum</h1>
<p>Achyranthemum paniculatum, commonly known as the Jerusalem artichoke, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, yellow-orange composite flower heads. The plant produces edible tubers that are rich in inulin, a prebiotic fiber. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers attract various pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthemum paniculatum has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. Its flowers are clustered in panicles, featuring small pink to red petals and stamen, blooming from summer to autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthemum paniculatum is a flowering plant native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it originally thrived in open grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its current distribution has expanded to include parts of Australia, New Zealand, and the United States, often as an introduced species. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and coastal dunes. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level up to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Despite its widespread presence, it is not considered a threatened species and is generally stable in its native and introduced ranges.</p>
