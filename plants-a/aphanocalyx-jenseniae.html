<p>Aphanocalyx jenseniae, commonly known as the Jensen's aphanocalyx, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Leguminosae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are often hidden among its dense foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and has small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
