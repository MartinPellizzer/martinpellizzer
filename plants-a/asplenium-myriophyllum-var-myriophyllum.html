                    <h1>Asplenium myriophyllum var. myriophyllum</h1>
<p>Asplenium myriophyllum var. myriophyllum, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet forests. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are usually bright green and can be either evergreen or deciduous depending on the climate.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
