<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy foliage. The plant has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor and drought-prone soils. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Argythamnia rhizantha is adapted to extreme environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh desert ecosystems.</p>
