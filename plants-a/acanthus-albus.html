                <h1>Acanthus albus</h1>
<p>Acanthus albus, commonly known as the white acanthus, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white, spathaceous flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has palmate leaves with deep lobes and a dense, fibrous root system. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Acanthus albus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and historical use in decorative art and architecture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acanthus albus has leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a wavy margin and a silvery-white underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are large, reaching up to 30 cm in length, and are a striking contrast to the deep green upper surface. The stem is woody, with a rough, furrowed bark that is dark brown in color, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The plant produces spiky, purple flower clusters in the summer, with small, tubular flowers arranged in a dense inflorescence; these flowers are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds through wind, and the roots are fibrous and well-developed, aiding in the plant's anchorage and nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthus albus is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, including southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends to parts of California and Oregon in the United States, where it has been introduced. This species thrives in coastal areas, rocky soils, and open habitats, often growing in sunny, well-drained environments. It typically grows at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Acanthus albus is generally considered to be of conservation concern in its native range due to habitat loss and invasive species competition.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acanthus albus is a striking perennial plant known for its tall, silvery foliage and dramatic white flower spikes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes in early spring. The plant has a long growing season, thriving in temperate climates and blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and consistent watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Regular fertilization in spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its vigor, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like lavender or rosemary can enhance its growth and deter unwanted pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acanthus albus is a flowering plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, spiny flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its beneficial properties. Its deep roots help with erosion control by stabilizing soil in sandy or coastal environments.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
