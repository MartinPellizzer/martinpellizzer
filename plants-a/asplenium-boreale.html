                    <h1>Asplenium boreale</h1>
<p>Asplenium boreale, commonly known as the northern shield fern, is a perennial fern native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium boreale is notable for its ability to thrive in cooler climates and its unique adaptation to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
