<p>Adenocaulon chilense, commonly known as the Chilean woolly weed, is a small annual herb native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It features a prostrate or ascending growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are alternate and linear, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Adenocaulon chilense is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
