<p>Aspidium pistillare, commonly known as the false holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the undersides of the leaves. Aspidium pistillare is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological studies.</p>
