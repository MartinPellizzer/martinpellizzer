<p>Acacia interior, commonly known as the interior acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, yellowish-green compound leaves. The plant produces fluffy, yellowish flower clusters that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody, fibrous bark is often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Acacia interior is well adapted to dry climates, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
