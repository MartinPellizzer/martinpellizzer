                        <h1>Acacia interior</h1>
<p>Acacia interior, commonly known as the interior acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, yellowish-green compound leaves. The plant produces fluffy, yellowish flower clusters that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody, fibrous bark is often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Acacia interior is well adapted to dry climates, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia interior is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in desert and semi-arid regions, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. This plant thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. It is often seen in scrublands and along the edges of grasslands.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, as well as regions in Baja California and Sonora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia interior was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It has been distributed across parts of Australia, particularly in the interior regions of Western Australia and South Australia. The plant is commonly found in shrublands and open woodlands, often forming dense thickets. Its introduction has been primarily for land stabilization and as a component of revegetation efforts.</p>
<p>However, it has also become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
