                <h1>Acia amara</h1>
<p>Acia amara, commonly known as bitter cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and thrives in moist, shady environments. Its seeds are often dispersed by water, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Acia amara is known for its peppery taste, which is due to the presence of glucosinolates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acia amara has leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, with a bright green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in spikes, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acia amara is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is commonly found in areas with mild, temperate climates. The plant is well adapted to arid conditions and can often be seen growing along coastal cliffs and in scrublands. Its distribution includes countries such as Spain, Italy, Morocco, and Turkey.</p>
<p>It is a hardy species that has been historically used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acia amara was mainly introduced to regions with Mediterranean climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in parts of Southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its bitter compounds, which are believed to have digestive benefits. Its introduction has sometimes led to naturalization in areas beyond its original range.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered non-invasive and is mostly grown in controlled environments.</p>
