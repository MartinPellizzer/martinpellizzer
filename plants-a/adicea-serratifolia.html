<p>Adicea serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated leaf adicea, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Acanthaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its opposite, serrated leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or undergrowth areas.</p>
<p>Adicea serratifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea serratifolia has elongated, serrated leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 10-15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea serratifolia is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in lowland rainforests and along riverbanks. Adicea serratifolia is usually found at altitudes between 0 and 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, it is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, although its habitat is under threat from deforestation and land conversion.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adicea serratifolia is a versatile ornamental plant known for its striking foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of Adicea serratifolia is typically slow to moderate, with new growth appearing in spring and reaching maturity within a few years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent moisture, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain shape and encourage new shoots. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
