                <h1>Adicea serratifolia</h1>
<p>Adicea serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated leaf adicea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, serrated leaves that are often hairy on the underside. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Adicea serratifolia is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea serratifolia has elliptical, serrated leaves that are alternate in arrangement, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length, with a deep green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing upright with some branching. Its small, clustered flowers are yellow with four petals, blooming in late spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea serratifolia is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found along forest edges or in abandoned agricultural lands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is also reported in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea serratifolia was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides, gardens, and abandoned fields. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can tolerate a range of environmental conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively contribute to its invasive potential in non-native regions.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a concern in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
