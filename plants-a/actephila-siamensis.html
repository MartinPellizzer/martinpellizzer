<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical forests.</p>
<p>Actephila siamensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila siamensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are glossy green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with serrated margins. The stem is slender, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age.
