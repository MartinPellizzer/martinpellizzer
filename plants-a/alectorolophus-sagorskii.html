<p>Alectorolophus sagorskii, commonly known as the Kauai ironwood, is a rare and endemic tree species found exclusively on the island of Kauai in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, a trait that contributes to its ecological significance in Hawaiian forests. Alectorolophus sagorskii plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>However, it faces threats from invasive species and habitat loss, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
