                <h1>Achyrocline macella</h1>
<p>Achyrocline macella, commonly known as the velvetleaf achyrocline, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually yellow or orange, with tubular corollas that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline macella has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy surface, arranged in pairs along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and covered with fine hairs, exhibiting a reddish-brown color. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when dry.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline macella is primarily native to Brazil South.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of Brazil, particularly in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, and Paran√°. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within subtropical and temperate forests. It is often associated with rocky soils and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline macella was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species that threatens native ecosystems. The plant spreads rapidly through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water. It often outcompetes native plants for resources such as sunlight and nutrients.</p>
<p>Control efforts are ongoing to limit its spread and protect local biodiversity.</p>
