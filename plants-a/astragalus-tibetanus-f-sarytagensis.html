                    <h1>Astragalus tibetanus f. sarytagensis</h1>
<p>Astragalus tibetanus f. sarytagensis, commonly known as the Sarytag Mountain milkvetch, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 4,000 meters. Its small, bean-like pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and environmental sensitivity, it is considered vulnerable to climate change and habitat degradation.</p>
