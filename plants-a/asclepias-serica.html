                    <h1>Asclepias serica</h1>
<p>Asclepias serica, commonly known as the silky milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers with prominent, horn-like structures called horns, which are typical of the milkweed genus. Asclepias serica is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential nourishment for caterpillars.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots and drought-resistant nature make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
