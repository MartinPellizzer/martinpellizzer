                <h1>Acca sellowiana var. rugosa</h1>
<p>Acca sellowiana var. rugosa, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *carambola*, is a tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive five-pointed, star-shaped fruit that turns yellow when ripe. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a rough, slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The fruit is not only ornamental but also edible, valued for its tart flavor and nutritional content.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acca sellowiana var. rugosa has ovate to elliptical leaves that are pubescent, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length with a dark green upper surface and lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as an erect shrub with a bushy habit. The flowers are fragrant, white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in spring and summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a spherical, yellow or orange berry that ripens in late summer, containing numerous small, smooth seeds dispersed by animals and wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous, shallow, and adapted to absorb moisture efficiently from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acca sellowiana var. rugosa is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of southern Brazil, eastern Paraguay, and northern Argentina. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soils. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acca sellowiana var. rugosa is a tropical shrub known for its fragrant, edible fruits and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal traits. The plant has a warm-season growth cycle, thriving in tropical and subtropical climates, and produces fruit 6–8 months after planting.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, fertile soil and regular watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant and promote fruiting are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with legumes or marigolds can enhance soil fertility and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acca sellowiana var. rugosa is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers and abundant nectar. The plant acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing biodiversity and soil health. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful for land stabilization.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the ecological balance by supporting a wide range of fauna and promoting a healthy ecosystem.</p>
