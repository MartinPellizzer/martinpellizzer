                <h1>Acrocomia tenuifrons</h1>
<p>Acrocomia tenuifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaved palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its slender, clustered stems and long, narrow leaves that give it its common name. Its inflorescences produce small, yellowish flowers that are followed by triangular, spiky fruits.</p>
<p>Acrocomia tenuifrons is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional practices in its native regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocomia tenuifrons has leaves that are elongated, narrow, and linear in shape, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a medium size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged, dry capsule that disperses its seeds by wind when it opens.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in water absorption in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocomia tenuifrons is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, particularly the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico. This palm thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. It is commonly associated with dry forests and limestone soils.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its native range, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocomia tenuifrons was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential use in agroforestry systems.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and dry forests where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant is valued for its tall, slender trunk and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to its adaptability, it has been planted in several countries for erosion control and as a shade tree.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in some ecosystems.</p>
