                <h1>Aechmea cumingii</h1>
<p>Aechmea cumingii, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom from the center. Its foliage is often variegated with white and green stripes, adding visual interest.</p>
<p>Aechmea cumingii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea cumingii has rosette-shaped leaves that are sword-like, arranged in a compact circle, with a waxy, bluish-green color and a sharp, pointed tip.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead having a short, fibrous base that resembles a pseudostem, with a smooth, light green surface. Its flowers are arranged in a spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, typically in shades of pink or red, and bloom during the summer months, pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in its epiphytic or terrestrial habitat.</p>
