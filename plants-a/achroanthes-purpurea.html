                <h1>Achroanthes purpurea</h1>
<p>Achroanthes purpurea, commonly known as the purple sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually purple or pink in color. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Achroanthes purpurea is adapted to arid environments and is often found in desert or semi-desert regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achroanthes purpurea has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically green with a slight purplish tinge, ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively thin throughout its growth. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring pink to purple petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achroanthes purpurea is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly in the coastal plain regions of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils along the edges of swamps, marshes, and other wetland habitats. This species is commonly found in the Carolinas and Florida, where it grows in open, sunny areas with high humidity. It is often associated with pine flatwoods and cypress swamps, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive plant species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achroanthes purpurea was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as landscaping and gardening.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and areas with moderate moisture. This plant thrives in environments with partial shade to full sun. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it has been introduced.</p>
