                <h1>Achroanthes purpurea</h1>
<p>Achroanthes purpurea, commonly known as the purple sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of small, violet to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapting to arid conditions.</p>
<p>It is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats, showcasing its resilience to harsh environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achroanthes purpurea has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, often branched, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with purple petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achroanthes purpurea is a flowering plant native to the southern United States, specifically found in parts of Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana.</p>
<p>Its current distribution has been expanded through cultivation, with some populations established in botanical gardens and conservation programs. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies, woodland edges, and rocky slopes. This species typically grows at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from 100 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Achroanthes purpurea is considered a species of concern and is protected in some states.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achroanthes purpurea is a striking plant known for its vibrant purple flowers and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with seed propagation typically requiring stratification for better germination. This perennial plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning after flowering help maintain its health and appearance.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions, and it benefits from companion planting with marigolds or lavender to deter pests.</p>
