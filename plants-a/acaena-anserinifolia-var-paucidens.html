<p>It features small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, followed by small, spiny fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins and along streams.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena anserinifolia var. paucidens is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This variety thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is often associated with coastal and subalpine environments.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena anserinifolia var. paucidens was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. This plant is commonly found in coastal and subalpine areas, particularly in the South Island. It has since become naturalized and is now considered a weed in some regions.</p>
<p>Its introduction has had ecological impacts on native plant communities.</p>
