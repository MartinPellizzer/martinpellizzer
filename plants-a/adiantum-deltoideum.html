                <h1>Adiantum deltoideum</h1>
<p>Adiantum deltoideum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of polypod fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is native to regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The plant is distinguished by its bright green, lanceolate leaves that are often adorned with a fine, silvery vein. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Adiantum deltoideum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum deltoideum has fern-like leaves that are triangular in shape, with a delicate, finely divided structure and a silvery-blue hue on the underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and wiry, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in late spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a cluster of spore cases that release spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum deltoideum is primarily native to Cuba, Haiti, and Jamaica.</p>
<p>This fern species is commonly found in the tropical regions of these Caribbean islands. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Adiantum deltoideum is known for its delicate, fan-shaped fronds that contribute to the biodiversity of its native habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific regions, making it a characteristic plant of the Caribbean flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum deltoideum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and horticultural trade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments like woodlands and rock crevices. This plant has adapted well to various climates and can thrive in both temperate and subtropical regions. Its ability to spread via spores allows it to colonize new areas rapidly.</p>
<p>However, its introduction can sometimes lead to competition with native species in certain ecosystems.</p>
