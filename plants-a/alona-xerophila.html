                    <h1>Alona xerophila</h1>
<p>Alona xerophila, commonly known as the desert water frog, is a unique plant adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures such as thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss and enhance drought tolerance. The plant's small size and compact growth form help minimize surface area exposed to harsh conditions. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Alona xerophila plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
