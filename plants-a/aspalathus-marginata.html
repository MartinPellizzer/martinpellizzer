                    <h1>Aspalathus marginata</h1>
<p>Aspalathus marginata, commonly known as the rooibos plant, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is particularly noted for its unique ability to thrive in the nutrient-poor soils of the fynbos biome. Its leaves are harvested and processed to produce the popular herbal tea known as rooibos.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Aspalathus marginata make it well-adapted to its arid environment and contribute to its ecological significance in the region.</p>
