                    <h1>Arabis cuneifolia f. kiboensis</h1>
<p>Arabis cuneifolia f. kiboensis, commonly known as the Kibo's rockcress, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa, particularly around Mount Kilimanjaro.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. This frost-tolerant plant thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing in crevices and on exposed slopes. Its foliage is typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
