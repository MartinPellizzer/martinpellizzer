<p>Agropyron pseudocaesium, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Agropyron pseudocaesium plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat.</p>
