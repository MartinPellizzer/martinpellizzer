<p>Anathallis paranapiacabensis, commonly known as the Paranapiac√° heliconia, is a species of orchid native to the Atlantic Forest in Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated inflorescence that bears numerous yellowish-orange flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the humid, shaded understory of the forest. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insects, such as flies and beetles, rather than bees.</p>
<p>The species is considered rare and is of significant ecological and botanical interest due to its unique morphology and habitat requirements.</p>
