                <h1>Acinos herba-barona</h1>
<p>Acinos herba-barona, commonly known as Spanish thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a disc-like cluster, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often arid habitat.</p>
<p>Acinos herba-barona is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient plant in Mediterranean climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos herba-barona has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and somewhat woody, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, white to pale pink, and clustered in loose inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos herba-barona is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula, specifically found in Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed in rocky and open habitats, particularly in southern Spain. This species thrives in sunny, dry environments with well-drained soils. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acinos herba-barona is listed as a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acinos herba-barona is a hardy, flowering plant known for its resilience and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing established clumps, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. The plant has a biennial growth cycle, flowering in its second year before setting seed and dying.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or mildew, which can be managed with organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
