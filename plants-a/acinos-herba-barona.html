                <h1>Acinos herba-barona</h1>
<p>Acinos herba-barona, commonly known as the Spanish snowbell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, round, green fruits that mature to a reddish hue. It thrives in rocky and calcareous soils, often found in alpine and subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos herba-barona has leaves that are simple, alternate, and lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a grayish-brown color, growing in a compact, cushion-like formation. The flowers are small, white to pale pink, clustered in dense heads, and bloom in late spring to early summer, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a small, dry achene, dispersed by wind due to its lightweight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky and dry environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos herba-barona is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky soils and mountainous areas, thriving in dry and sunny environments. This plant is particularly associated with the Iberian Peninsula, where it grows in open habitats such as cliffs, slopes, and gravelly ground. It is also present in regions like southern France, Italy, and parts of Turkey.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a rare or localized species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos herba-barona was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and gravelly slopes.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in regions with low precipitation. The plant is characterized by its basal rosettes of narrow, blue-green leaves and small yellow flowers. It spreads through wind-dispersed seeds and can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been reported in several regions across Europe and parts of North America.</p>
