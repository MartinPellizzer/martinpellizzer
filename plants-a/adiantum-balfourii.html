                <h1>Adiantum balfourii</h1>
<p>Adiantum balfourii, commonly known as the Balfour's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, almost feather-like appearance.</p>
<p>Adiantum balfourii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum balfourii has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with a delicate, lacey appearance and a light green color.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically small, ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters in length, and are arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a clump-forming pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, and these bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, spore-bearing structure that disperses spores through wind, and the roots are fibrous, helping to anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum balfourii is primarily native to Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Socotra, Sudan, and South Sudan.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these countries. It typically grows in rocky or limestone areas, often in dry, sunny environments. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>It is an important species in the local flora of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum balfourii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. This fern is often cultivated in gardens due to its delicate, lace-like fronds and ornamental value. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in these areas and has not been widely naturalized.</p>
