                <h1>Adenophora triphylla var. hakusanensis</h1>
<p>Adenophora triphylla var. hakusanensis, commonly known as the Hakusan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are hairy and often branching.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora triphylla var. hakusanensis has trifoliate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a slightly hairy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and somewhat woody with a smooth, light brown bark, growing in a clump-like pattern. Its flowers are bell-shaped, with five lobes, pale blue to violet in color, blooming in summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora triphylla var. hakusanensis is a flowering plant native to Japan, specifically found in Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to these regions, where it grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. It typically thrives at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this rare and delicate species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenophora triphylla var. hakusanensis is a delicate flowering plant native to East Asia, known for its bell-shaped blue or purple flowers and upright growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or division of rhizomes, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. This perennial plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while pruning dead foliage in late autumn helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or yarrow can enhance its growth and attract beneficial pollinators.</p>
