<p>Astrogyne, commonly known as the moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apocynaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical regions of the Americas and are characterized by their large, showy flowers that open at night. The flowers typically have a pale or white color, which helps in attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Astrogyne species are often shrubs or small trees, with opposite, simple leaves and milky sap.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their unique blooming habits.</p>
