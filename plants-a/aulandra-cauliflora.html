<p>Aulandra cauliflora, commonly known as the cauliflower orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, where flowers and leaves grow directly from the stem, forming a dense, cauliflower-like structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store moisture, while its flowers are small and clustered in a compact, white or pale green head.</p>
<p>Aulandra cauliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses.</p>
