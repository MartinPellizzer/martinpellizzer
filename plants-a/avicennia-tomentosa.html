                    <h1>Avicennia tomentosa</h1>
<p>Avicennia tomentosa, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a halophytic shrub that thrives in coastal and brackish water environments.</p>
<p>It has small, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are adapted for wind pollination, and its fruits are buoyant, aiding in seed dispersal by water. Avicennia tomentosa plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its root system also helps filter pollutants from the water, contributing to the health of coastal ecosystems.</p>
