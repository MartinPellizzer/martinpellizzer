                    <h1>Astragalus pasqualensis</h1>
<p>Astragalus pasqualensis, commonly known as Pasqual's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. It produces small, lens-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions.</p>
