                <h1>Acinos pseudacinos</h1>
<p>Acinos pseudacinos, commonly known as the alpine flax or narrowleaf acinos, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>Acinos pseudacinos is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos pseudacinos has leaves that are oblanceolate to elliptic in shape, with a silver-gray upper surface and a darker green underside, arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, somewhat woody, with a rough, bark-like texture and a reddish-brown color, growing in a prostrate or creeping manner. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in rocky or disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos pseudacinos is primarily native to the western United States and parts of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as California, Oregon, and Nevada. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats including grasslands, slopes, and disturbed areas. It is often associated with chaparral and sagebrush ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the Pacific coast and interior deserts of the southwestern U.S.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos pseudacinos was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, gravel bars, and disturbed grasslands.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid regions. This plant has become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and seed production. Its introduction has led to concerns about ecological impact in regions where it has established itself.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to control its spread and protect native plant communities.</p>
