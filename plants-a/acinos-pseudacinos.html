                <h1>Acinos pseudacinos</h1>
<p>Acinos pseudacinos, commonly known as the alpine everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cold, dry conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The small, yellow flowers bloom in late summer, producing seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos pseudacinos has basal leaves that are oblanceolate in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a silver-gray color and a fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and green, growing from the base with a compact growth pattern. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos pseudacinos is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Italy, France, and the Iberian Peninsula, though it is considered rare. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils in open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Acinos pseudacinos is listed as endangered in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acinos pseudacinos is a low-growing, flowering perennial known for its delicate pink blooms and ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing established clumps, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. The plant has a dormant winter growth cycle, blooming in early spring and producing seeds by late summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of a balanced fertilizer in spring, while pruning dead flowers and foliage in autumn promotes healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs in wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acinos pseudacinos is a low-growing perennial plant that provides essential food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its bright yellow flowers, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. This plant acts as a companion plant in mixed vegetation, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system, which helps bind the soil together.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acinos pseudacinos contributes to nutrient cycling by supporting microbial activity in the soil.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acinos pseudacinos is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, known for its small, daisy-like flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>While it is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and landscaping, it also has limited culinary uses, with its young leaves sometimes consumed in local cuisines. In traditional medicine, it has been used to treat respiratory conditions and as a mild sedative. Its role in ecological systems supports pollinators and contributes to soil stabilization in arid environments.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and adaptability, often appearing in regional folklore and artistic representations.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acinos pseudacinos has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Albiflorus' and 'Pallidus', which are noted for their soft, silvery foliage and delicate white flowers. While natural hybrids of Acinos pseudacinos are relatively rare, horticulturists have developed selections that enhance its aesthetic appeal. These cultivars are often used in rock gardens and alpine settings due to their compact growth and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Overall, Acinos pseudacinos holds horticultural importance as a hardy, low-maintenance plant that adds visual interest to garden landscapes.</p>
