                <h1>Achillea erba-rotta var. morisiana</h1>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta var. morisiana, commonly known as the Morisiana yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems that bear feathery, finely divided leaves. The plant produces flat, composite flower heads in shades of white to pale yellow, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its botanical name honors the Greek hero Achilles, reflecting its historical use in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta var. morisiana has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they are generally 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-green color, growing from the base with a branching pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets and brown disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta var. morisiana is a rare variant of the common yarrow that is native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy, particularly in the Apennine Mountains.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few specific locations in the regions of Abruzzo and Molise, where it grows in rocky and limestone soils. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, typically found at elevations between 1,200 and 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited population size, it is classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique plant.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta var. morisiana is a low-maintenance perennial known for its vibrant yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta var. morisiana is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds and foliage for sustenance. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its ability to deter pests. Additionally, its dense root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>It contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health through organic matter accumulation.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta var. morisiana is a lesser-known plant with limited direct culinary use, though its flowers may be used in ornamental teas or as a mild flavoring in some traditional recipes.</p>
<p>Historically, it has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties, though scientific validation remains limited. Its role in industrial applications is minimal, as it is not widely cultivated for commercial purposes. Culturally, it may hold symbolic value in local traditions or as a wildflower in certain regions.</p>
<p>Overall, its primary significance lies in ecological roles and as a botanical specimen of interest.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
