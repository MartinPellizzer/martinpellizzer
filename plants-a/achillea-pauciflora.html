                <h1>Achillea pauciflora</h1>
<p>Achillea pauciflora, commonly known as the lesser yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and alpine environments. The plant features a bushy growth habit with dark green, feather-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its flowers are typically arranged in flat-topped umbels, and the plant is known for its aromatic, slightly medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Achillea pauciflora is often used in traditional herbal medicine and is valued for its resilience in harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pauciflora has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a bluish-green color, and are arranged in a rosette formation, typically reaching up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, covered in a rough, grayish-brown bark, and grows from the base of the plant. Its flowers are composite, consisting of pale yellow ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to the presence of a pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pauciflora is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, rocky, and sunny environments, often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. This plant is commonly associated with dry grasslands and open woodlands where it can receive ample sunlight. Its limited distribution is due to its specific ecological requirements and historical range.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pauciflora was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can spread rapidly in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species.</p>
