<p>Australluma ubomboensis, commonly known as the Ubombo ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale, translucent petals that seem to float above the foliage. The plant belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is known for its striking, almost otherworldly visual effect. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops near the coast.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
