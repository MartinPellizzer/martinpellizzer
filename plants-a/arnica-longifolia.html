<p>Arnica longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf arnica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers in the summer months. Its flowers are composed of numerous ray florets surrounding a central disk, typical of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>Arnica longifolia is valued for its medicinal properties, though it is often confused with other arnica species due to similar appearances.</p>
