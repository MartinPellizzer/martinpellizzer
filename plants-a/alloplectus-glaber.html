<p>Alloplectus glaber, commonly known as the smooth bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, leafless stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Alloplectus glaber lacks true leaves and instead has specialized structures for photosynthesis and prey capture.</p>
<p>It is a carnivorous plant that relies on captured prey to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters.</p>
