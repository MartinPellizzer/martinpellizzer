                    <h1>Atriplex gardneri var. tridentata</h1>
<p>Atriplex gardneri var. tridentata, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt crystals, a feature that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of the Chenopodiaceae family. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
