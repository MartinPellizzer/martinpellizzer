<p>Ascium selloi, commonly known as the Sello's ascidium, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often fragrant leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forest undergrowth. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ascium selloi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
