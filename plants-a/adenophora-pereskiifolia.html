                <h1>Adenophora pereskiifolia</h1>
<p>Adenophora pereskiifolia, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its flowering stems are often hairy, and it is adapted to grow in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Adenophora pereskiifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in cooler climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora pereskiifolia has lance-shaped, alternate leaves that are typically 5-10 cm long and 1-2 cm wide, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and slightly woody at the base, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more fibrous with age. Its flowers are clustered in racemes, featuring tubular blue to purple petals with yellow anthers, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish in moist, woodland habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora pereskiifolia is primarily native to Amur, Buryatiya, Chita, Inner Mongolia, Japan, Khabarovsk, Korea, Kuril Is., Manchuria, Mongolia, Primorye, Yakutiya.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in these regions across East Asia. This plant typically grows in moist, forested areas or along riverbanks. It is well adapted to the temperate to subarctic climates of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes both continental and island regions within this vast geographic area.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora pereskiifolia was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, typically in temperate climates.</p>
<p>It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites where it can establish easily. This plant is valued for its ornamental flowers and has been cultivated in gardens and landscapes. Its introduction has sometimes led to naturalization in regions beyond its original range.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered non-invasive and beneficial to local ecosystems.</p>
