                    <h1>Alchemilla sarojiniae</h1>
<p>Alchemilla sarojiniae, commonly known as the Sarojini alpine lady, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a soft, woolly layer, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
