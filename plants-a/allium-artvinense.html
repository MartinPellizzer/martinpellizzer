                    <h1>Allium artvinense</h1>
<p>Allium artvinense, commonly known as the Artvin garlic, is a rare and endemic species native to the eastern Black Sea region of Turkey.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, pale purple to white flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that are similar to garlic but are not typically used for culinary purposes. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Allium artvinense is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
