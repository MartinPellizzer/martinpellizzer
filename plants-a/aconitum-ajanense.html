                <h1>Aconitum ajanense</h1>
<p>Aconitum ajanense, commonly known as the Ajanense monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features large, palmately divided leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Aconitum ajanense contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to both humans and animals.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum ajanense has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are typically deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring up to 20 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a straight, unbranched pattern. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petals and a spurs, arranged in racemes; they bloom in late summer to early autumn and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, often forming a dense network underground.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum ajanense is primarily native to the regions of Khabarovsk and Magadan in Russia.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in the cold, mountainous environments of these areas. It is commonly found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the Far East.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific regions due to its particular ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum ajanense was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue flowers and hardy nature. Despite its beauty, it has become a weed in some areas, spreading aggressively in disturbed soils. The plant is now considered invasive in parts of New Zealand, posing a threat to native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the risks associated with non-native plant species in ecological settings.</p>
