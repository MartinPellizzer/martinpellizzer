                <h1>Acrostichum nodosum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum nodosum, commonly known as the coastal fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils near coastal areas and is often found in mangrove swamps. Its reproductive structures include spore-producing cones, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum nodosum plays an important ecological role by stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum nodosum has large, pinnate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a feather-like arrangement and a width of up to 1 meter.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and upright, with a rough, fibrous bark that is typically brown in color. It does not produce flowers, as it is a fern and reproduces through spores rather than seeds. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that spreads horizontally underground, allowing it to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Its leaves are used for ornamental purposes and are often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum nodosum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including the Caribbean, Central America, and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, coastal environments such as mangrove swamps and salt marshes. This plant is commonly found along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States. It is also present in regions of Mexico and the West Indies.</p>
<p>Acrostichum nodosum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum nodosum was mainly introduced to coastal areas and wetlands where it can thrive in moist, saline environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in regions with high humidity and poor drainage, such as mangrove swamps and salt marshes. This plant is known for its ability to tolerate brackish water and can spread through both vegetative reproduction and seed dispersal. Its introduction has sometimes led to changes in local ecosystems, affecting native plant species and soil composition.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, Acrostichum nodosum has become an important species in restoration projects in coastal regions.</p>
