<p>Aridaria arcuata, commonly known as the curved sandburs, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and small, spiny fruits. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptations include deep root systems and waxy leaves to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Aridaria arcuata is often found in sandy soils and is used in restoration projects due to its resilience in harsh environments.</p>
