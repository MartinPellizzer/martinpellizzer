                    <h1>Angorkis cryptodon</h1>
<p>Angorkis cryptodon, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique species of fern characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that resemble translucent leaves.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Despite its ethereal appearance, it is relatively low maintenance and can be a striking addition to a shaded garden or indoor collection.</p>
