                <h1>Adicea integrifolia</h1>
<p>Adicea integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf adicea, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its simple, entire leaves that are often arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, often displaying vibrant colors such as red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Adicea integrifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea integrifolia has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are medium-sized, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and are arranged spirally along the stem. The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plantâ€™s growth. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when it splits open, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea integrifolia is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, and parts of the Western Cape. This plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils along the shoreline. It is commonly seen in dune environments and is adapted to the harsh coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Adicea integrifolia is an important component of the local flora and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea integrifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats, including disturbed soils and along stream banks. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in diverse conditions have contributed to its establishment in the wild. However, it is considered a potential weed in some regions, raising concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to monitor its distribution and assess its effects on native plant communities.</p>
