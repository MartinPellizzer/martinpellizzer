                <h1>Adicea integrifolia</h1>
<p>Adicea integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved adicea, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, entire leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. Adicea integrifolia is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of tropical flora.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea integrifolia has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with smooth margins and a glossy dark green color, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows in a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea integrifolia is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Socotra, located in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>While it was once thought to be extinct, it has been rediscovered in limited areas of Socotra, indicating a very restricted current distribution. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, typically growing in coastal areas and among limestone formations. The plant is found at low altitudes, usually below 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its extremely limited range and habitat threats, Adicea integrifolia is considered critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adicea integrifolia is a resilient plant commonly grown for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method. The plant has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in about two years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer in spring and regular pruning to maintain shape and encourage new growth are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adicea integrifolia is a flowering plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other flora in its vicinity. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Adicea integrifolia can act as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil and promoting the growth of surrounding vegetation.</p>
