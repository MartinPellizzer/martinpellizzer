                    <h1>Anthriscus stenophylla</h1>
<p>Anthriscus stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its fern-like leaves and tall, branched stems.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are narrow and deeply lobed, often resembling those of other hogweeds.</p>
<p>While it is not as toxic as some other members of its family, it can still cause skin irritation upon contact with sunlight.</p>
