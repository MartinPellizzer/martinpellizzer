<p>Arenaria cassia, commonly known as golden sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
