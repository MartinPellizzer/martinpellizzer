<p>Abies decidua, commonly known as the Serbian fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age, while its roots are adapted to thrive in well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>The Serbian fir is often found in high-altitude forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance.</p>
