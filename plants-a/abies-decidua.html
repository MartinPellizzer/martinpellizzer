                        <h1>Abies decidua</h1>
<p>Abies decidua, commonly known as the Serbian fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age, while its roots are adapted to thrive in well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>The Serbian fir is often found in high-altitude forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies decidua is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe, including countries such as Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Slovakia.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically found in alpine and subalpine forests. This species is commonly found in areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils. It is often associated with mixed coniferous forests and can be found at elevations ranging from 1,200 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in these mountain ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies decidua was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly planted in gardens and parks for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded conditions. This species is particularly suited for USDA hardiness zones 4 through 7. Its introduction has been noted in several regions of North America, where it has been cultivated for both aesthetic and ecological purposes.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential invasiveness in native ecosystems.</p>
