                <h1>Actinodaphne pruinosa</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne pruinosa, commonly known as the Pruinose Cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like cinnamon and laurel. The plant is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically greenish-white, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne pruinosa has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“12 cm in length, with a dark glossy green color on the upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white or pale green petals, and they bloom during the dry season; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, yellowish drupe that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
