                    <h1>Arceuthobium campylopodum subsp. occidentale</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium campylopodum subsp.</p>
<p>occidentale, commonly known as the western dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the stems of coniferous trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it an obligate parasite.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous leaves and relies on wind-dispersed seeds for propagation. Its life cycle involves a complex interaction with its host, often leading to reduced growth and vigor in the host tree.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to western North America, particularly in regions with suitable coniferous forests.</p>
