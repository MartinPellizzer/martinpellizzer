<p>Anacampseros comptonii, commonly known as the Compton's ice plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental touch. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens in arid climates.</p>
