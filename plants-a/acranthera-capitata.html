                <h1>Acranthera capitata</h1>
<p>Acranthera capitata, commonly known as the Cape snowflake, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, white to pale blue flowers that resemble snowflakes. The plant typically grows in grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in full sun. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Acranthera capitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera capitata has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and range from 5 to 15 cm in length with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light green to pale brown color, growing in a branching pattern. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences with small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera capitata is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in areas with moist and shaded conditions. The plant typically grows in the understorey of dense vegetation, where it thrives in the humid climate. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its small, delicate flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Borneo.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera capitata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in certain regions of the country. The plant was likely introduced through accidental means, such as seed contamination in imported goods. It thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid spread, it is now a concern for conservationists and land managers.</p>
