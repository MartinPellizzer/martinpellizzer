                <h1>Acosta consanguinea</h1>
<p>Acosta consanguinea, commonly known as the red-flowered acosta, is a member of the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in tropical regions of South America. The plant is characterized by its distinctive red flowers, which are often clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are ovate and have a velvety texture, while its stems are woody and branching.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta consanguinea has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown to reddish-brown in color. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with a pale yellowish-white color, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensively branched, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta consanguinea is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Andean foothills and lowland areas, where the climate is warm and humid. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with cloud forests and secondary growth habitats. It is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in the ecological balance of these regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in certain parts of its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta consanguinea was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in states like California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It has been documented in disturbed areas such as roadsides, waste grounds, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in sunny, open habitats with well-drained soil. Its introduction is likely due to human activities, including landscaping and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and has limited ecological impact in its introduced range.</p>
