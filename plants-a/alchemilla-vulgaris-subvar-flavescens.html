<p>Alchemilla vulgaris subvar. flavescens, commonly known as golden alchemilla, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing rosette of basal leaves that are typically silver-white to gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in compact clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in moist, shady environments.</p>
