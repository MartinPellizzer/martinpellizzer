                    <h1>Anthyllis montana var. atropurpurea</h1>
<p>Anthyllis montana var. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple mountain everlasting, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. It is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its long-lasting, violet-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
