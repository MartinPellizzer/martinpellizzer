                <h1>Acosta rufidula</h1>
<p>Acosta rufidula, commonly known as the red-stemmed acosta, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking red stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or riparian habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta rufidula has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy green color on the upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, upright, and have a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are pink to purple in color, with five petals and a tubular structure, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to thrive in dry, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta rufidula is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with flooded habitats and is well adapted to waterlogged soils. It plays an important ecological role in these environments by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the presence of aquatic ecosystems in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta rufidula was mainly introduced to new environments due to its adaptability and rapid growth.</p>
<p>It has been observed in regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it can thrive in disturbed soils and open areas. The plant is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides, where it can outcompete native species. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor its spread and assess its ecological effects.</p>
