<p>Asplenium septentrionale subsp.</p>
<p>septentrionale, commonly known as the northern maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that resemble the leaves of a maidenhair fern.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
