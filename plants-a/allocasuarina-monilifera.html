                    <h1>Allocasuarina monilifera</h1>
<p>Allocasuarina monilifera, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in woody cones and dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize sandy or coastal soils.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited to coastal and inland dry areas, making it an important component of native vegetation in these regions.</p>
