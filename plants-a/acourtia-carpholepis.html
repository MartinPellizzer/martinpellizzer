                    <h1>Acourtia carpholepis</h1>
<p>Acourtia carpholepis, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with a rosette of blue-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry soils.</p>
<p>Acourtia carpholepis is well adapted to extreme temperatures and is an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
