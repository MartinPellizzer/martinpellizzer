                <h1>Acourtia carpholepis</h1>
<p>Acourtia carpholepis, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with a rosette of blue-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry soils.</p>
<p>Acourtia carpholepis is well adapted to extreme temperatures and is an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia carpholepis has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia carpholepis is primarily native to Mexico Central, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Southeast, and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in coastal and inland regions across these areas. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often associated with dune or scrubland habitats. The species is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its ecological preference for specific environmental conditions found throughout these parts of Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia carpholepis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, particularly in coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soil, making it common in coastal dunes and grasslands. The plant is often found in areas where native vegetation has been altered or removed, such as along roadsides and in agricultural fields. Its introduction has led to competition with native species, affecting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soils.</p>
