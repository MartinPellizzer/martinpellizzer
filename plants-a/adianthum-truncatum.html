                <h1>Adianthum truncatum</h1>
<p>Adianthum truncatum, commonly known as the cut-leaved maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Adiantaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically grayish-white in color due to the presence of trichomes. The plant is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a distinctive truncate or cut-off shape at the tips.</p>
<p>Adianthum truncatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is appreciated for its graceful, airy appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adianthum truncatum has fern-like leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 1 to 3 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are a vibrant green, with a leathery texture and a serrated margin. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows in a compact, clumping pattern. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers with separate male and female structures, blooming in early spring, and is pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that disperses its tiny seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adianthum truncatum is primarily native to the eastern and central United States, including states such as Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of the Appalachian Mountains and the southeastern regions of the country. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and forest floors. It is commonly associated with limestone soils and thrives in humid environments.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into parts of Canada, particularly in Ontario and Quebec.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adianthum truncatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along streambanks. The plant is often associated with disturbed sites and can spread rapidly in these environments. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
