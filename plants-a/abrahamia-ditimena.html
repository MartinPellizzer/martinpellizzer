<p>Abrahamia ditimena, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in rocky or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Abrahamia ditimena is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems.</p>
