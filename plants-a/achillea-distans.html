<p>Achillea distans, commonly known as the distant yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features slender, upright stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters.</p>
<p>Achillea distans is often found in meadows and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea distans has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-gray color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and somewhat hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea distans is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly found in countries such as Spain, Portugal, and southern France.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of North Africa and the Canary Islands, where it has been introduced. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in Mediterranean shrublands and open woodlands. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Achillea distans is considered to be of conservation concern in some regions.</p>
