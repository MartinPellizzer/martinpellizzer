                <h1>Achillea distans</h1>
<p>Achillea distans, commonly known as distant yarrow, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads that range from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its slender, branched stems are often covered in fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>The leaves are finely divided and aromatic, with a distinctive, slightly bitter scent.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea distans has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a bluish-green color and a serrated margin, typically measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and somewhat hairy, with a pale green to reddish-brown color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-white, and arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea distans is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly found in countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Europe, where it has been introduced and occasionally naturalized. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in alpine meadows and steppe environments. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited native range and habitat specificity, Achillea distans is considered to be of conservation concern, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea distans is a hardy perennial plant known for its daisy-like flowers and long bloom period.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes in early spring or fall. The growth cycle of Achillea distans typically spans from early spring to late summer, with the plant entering dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its health and shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea distans is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, contributing to biodiversity in its ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of neighboring flora by improving soil conditions. Its dense growth habit also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea distans offers ecological benefits by enhancing habitat structure and promoting a balanced ecosystem.</p>
