                <h1>Acrostichum bakeri</h1>
<p>Acrostichum bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense forests. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, narrow shape.</p>
<p>Acrostichum bakeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum bakeri has large, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum bakeri is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and swampy areas where there is high humidity and abundant moisture. This plant thrives in disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and coastal areas. It is often associated with mangrove ecosystems and can tolerate brackish water conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum bakeri was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils and saline environments.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the state of New South Wales, particularly in areas with high wind exposure and minimal rainfall. The plant is commonly found in dunes and saltmarshes, often colonizing disturbed or degraded habitats. Its introduction has been linked to both natural seed dispersal by wind and human activities such as coastal development and land clearing.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common species in many coastal ecosystems along the eastern seaboard.</p>
