                <h1>Actinocarya bhutanica</h1>
<p>Actinocarya bhutanica, commonly known as the Bhutan goldenbush, is a rare flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-green leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high elevations. Its botanical features include thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocarya bhutanica has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, clustered in panicles, and bloom in early spring; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocarya bhutanica is primarily native to the eastern Himalayas, specifically Bhutan and northeastern India.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest environments at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, often growing near streams or in mountain valleys. It is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of its native region.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocarya bhutanica was mainly introduced to regions with moist, temperate climates, particularly in mountainous areas with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with high humidity and partial shade, making it suitable for cultivation in subtropical and temperate zones. This plant is often found in forest understories, where it benefits from the shade provided by larger trees. Its introduction has been noted in parts of Southeast Asia and the Himalayan foothills.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological adaptability, it has been cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas.</p>
