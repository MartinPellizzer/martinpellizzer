                    <h1>Acer lactescens</h1>
<p>Acer lactescens, commonly known as the white maple, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones.</p>
<p>The plant has a relatively short lifespan compared to other maple species, typically living for 30 to 50 years.</p>
