                <h1>Acer lactescens</h1>
<p>Acer lactescens, commonly known as the white maple, is a small deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, light-gray bark and delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer lactescens has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer lactescens is a rare tree species native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, specifically in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few remote areas within these regions, where it grows in humid, temperate climates. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils found in mountain forests and is typically found at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation and climate change, Acer lactescens is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer lactescens is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its delicate, lace-like foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and thrives in cool, moist climates.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, acidic soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or heathers can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a healthy ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer lactescens is a native tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil health and promoting the growth of other native plants. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its deep root system, which stabilizes soil and prevents runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer lactescens contributes to carbon sequestration, helping to mitigate climate change impacts in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer lactescens is a lesser-known maple species primarily valued for its ornamental qualities, making it a popular choice in horticulture and landscaping due to its striking autumn foliage.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its sap may have potential for minor food-related uses. In traditional medicine, it has been explored for its potential anti-inflammatory properties, though research is limited. Economically, it contributes to the forestry and timber industries in certain regions.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and natural beauty, often inspiring artistic and literary expressions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer lactescens has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are appreciated for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Autumn Flame,' known for their striking fall color. Hybrids of Acer lactescens are often created to enhance growth habits and seasonal display. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their adaptability and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>They are widely used in gardens and landscapes for their vibrant foliage and unique form.</p>
