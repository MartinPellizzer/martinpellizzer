                    <h1>Atriplex nuttallii var. anomala</h1>
<p>Atriplex nuttallii var. anomala, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. Its salt tolerance allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant's deep root system enables it to access groundwater, contributing to its survival in harsh conditions.</p>
