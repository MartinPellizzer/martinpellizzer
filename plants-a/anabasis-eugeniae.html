                    <h1>Anabasis eugeniae</h1>
<p>Anabasis eugeniae, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and purple, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Anabasis eugeniae plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native ecosystem.</p>
