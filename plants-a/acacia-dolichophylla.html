                    <h1>Acacia dolichophylla</h1>
<p>Acacia dolichophylla, commonly known as the long-leaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous phyllodes that are typically 10â€“20 cm in length. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical spikes, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a feature common in many acacia species, reducing water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia dolichophylla is often found in coastal or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray.</p>
