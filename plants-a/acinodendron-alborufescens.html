                <h1>Acinodendron alborufescens</h1>
<p>Acinodendron alborufescens, commonly known as the white-red acacia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale yellow, arranged in racemes, while the bark is smooth and often reddish in color.</p>
<p>Acinodendron alborufescens is noted for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife and its potential use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron alborufescens has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are elliptic in shape, with a smooth texture and a glossy green color on the upper surface and a lighter, sometimes silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a rough, bark-like texture that is typically reddish-brown in color, and it grows in a climbing or trailing pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's climbing habit and anchoring it to supports in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron alborufescens is primarily native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern part of the island, specifically in the humid lowland rainforests. This plant typically grows in shaded undergrowth, often near streams or in moist, well-drained soils. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within Madagascar's biodiversity-rich ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron alborufescens was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in disturbed soils and secondary forests.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high rainfall and partial shade, making it suitable for reforestation projects. The plant has been introduced to several tropical countries in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. It is valued for its ornamental leaves and potential ecological benefits.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant species and ecosystem balance.</p>
