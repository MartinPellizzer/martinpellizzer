                    <h1>Acacia ingrata</h1>
<p>Acacia ingrata, commonly known as the desert acacia, is a shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thorned stems and small, pale green leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Acacia ingrata is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water.</p>
