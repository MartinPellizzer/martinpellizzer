                    <h1>Anguina cuspidata</h1>
<p>Anguina cuspidata, commonly known as the cuspidate nematode, is a microscopic plant-parasitic nematode belonging to the family Anguinidae.</p>
<p>It primarily infects the roots of various plants, including economically important crops such as wheat and barley. The nematode's life cycle involves several stages, with the infective second-stage larvae penetrating the root tissues. Anguina cuspidata feeds on root cells, causing damage that can lead to reduced growth and yield in affected plants.</p>
<p>Its presence is often indicated by symptoms such as stunted growth, yellowing leaves, and poor overall plant health.</p>
