<p>Arcytophyllum capitatum, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and evergreen foliage, which are adapted to harsh, cold environments. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it withstands strong winds and low temperatures. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it blooms during the short growing season of summer.</p>
<p>Arcytophyllum capitatum plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates.</p>
