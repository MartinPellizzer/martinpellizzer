                    <h1>Ariocarpus pulcherrimus</h1>
<p>Ariocarpus pulcherrimus, commonly known as the "beautiful fruit" or "hairy pincushion cactus," is a small, spineless cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of pale green to yellowish hairs, which helps protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant produces striking, red or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its unique morphology and ability to thrive in arid conditions make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
