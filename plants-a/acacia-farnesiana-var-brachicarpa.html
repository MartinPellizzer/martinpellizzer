<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces pods containing seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its nectar is a valuable food source for bees, contributing to honey production.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia farnesiana var. brachicarpa is primarily native to the southern United States, including Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, as well as parts of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in desert scrublands and along rocky soils. This variety is adapted to hot, dry climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions. It is commonly seen in regions with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure.</p>
