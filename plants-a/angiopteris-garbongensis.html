<p>Angiopteris garbongensis, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of water fern native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Matteuciaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its fronds are typically light green and have a feathery appearance, contributing to its aesthetic appeal in aquatic settings.</p>
<p>Angiopteris garbongensis plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
