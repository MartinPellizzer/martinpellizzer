<p>Adiantum robinsonii, commonly known as the Robinson's maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features intricate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the fern family.</p>
<p>Adiantum robinsonii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in humid, shaded gardens.</p>
