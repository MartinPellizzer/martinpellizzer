                    <h1>Acacia desertorum var. desertorum</h1>
<p>Acacia desertorum var. desertorum, commonly known as the desert acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, compound leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
