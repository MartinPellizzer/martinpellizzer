                    <h1>Anabasis saxaul</h1>
<p>Anabasis saxaul, commonly known as the saxaul tree, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater and survive in dry conditions. The plant has small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. It produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds.</p>
<p>Saxaul plays an important role in preventing soil erosion and is used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
