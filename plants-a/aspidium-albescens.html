<p>Aspidium albescens, commonly known as the white-stemmed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive white or pale coloration on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Aspidium albescens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
