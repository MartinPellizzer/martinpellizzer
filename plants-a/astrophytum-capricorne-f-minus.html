                    <h1>Astrophytum capricorne f. minus</h1>
<p>Astrophytum capricorne f. minus, commonly known as the miniature hedgehog cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus with a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in small, spiny tubercles that give it a unique, almost armored look. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise subdued appearance. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation.</p>
