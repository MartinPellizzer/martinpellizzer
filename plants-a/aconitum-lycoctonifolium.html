                <h1>Aconitum lycoctonifolium</h1>
<p>Aconitum lycoctonifolium, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments, and the stems are often covered in a sticky substance.</p>
<p>However, all parts of the plant are highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids like aconitine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum lycoctonifolium has large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green color and a rough texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and erect, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes rougher as the plant matures. Its flowers are blue to violet in color, arranged in dense spikes, and consist of five petals with a spurred lower petal, blooming in late summer; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through wind dispersal, and the seeds are small and black.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storage and survival in various soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum lycoctonifolium is primarily native to Tibet.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the high-altitude regions of Tibet, where it thrives in cold and mountainous environments. It is commonly found in alpine meadows and rocky areas at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 meters. The species is adapted to the harsh climate of the Tibetan Plateau, which is characterized by low temperatures and strong winds.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum lycoctonifolium was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, showy flowers.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated gardens into natural habitats, often colonizing moist, shaded areas in forests and along stream banks. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types have contributed to its establishment in non-native regions. However, it is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species.</p>
