                    <h1>Avicennia officinalis f. tomentosa</h1>
<p>Avicennia officinalis f. tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy mangrove, is a variant of the mangrove species native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering on the stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant thrives in intertidal zones, where it tolerates periodic submersion and high salinity. Its small, ovate leaves are adapted for efficient gas exchange in waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>This species plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
