<p>Athyrium wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread gradually.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
