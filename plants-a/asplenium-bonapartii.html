<p>Asplenium bonapartii, commonly known as the Bonaparte's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature in ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Asplenium bonapartii is relatively uncommon and is often considered a rare or endangered species in its native habitats.</p>
