                    <h1>Alchemilla nudans</h1>
<p>Alchemilla nudans, commonly known as the smooth lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its common name reflects the historical belief that it could be used in alchemical practices to produce the legendary philosopher's stone.</p>
