                        <h1>Acaena leptacantha subsp. glabricupula</h1>
<p>Acaena leptacantha subsp.</p>
<p>glabricupula, commonly known as the smooth-cupule acaena, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and small, spiny leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces spherical, woody fruits known as cupules, which are smooth and glabrous. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in coastal and montane regions, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena leptacantha subsp.</p>
<p>glabricupula is primarily native to southern South America, specifically in Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in temperate regions, particularly in the Andes mountain range.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often associated with shrublands and grasslands. It is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these countries.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena leptacantha subsp.</p>
<p>glabricupula was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is now considered an environmental weed in certain regions of New Zealand. Its spread has been facilitated by its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its prolific seed production.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to manage its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
