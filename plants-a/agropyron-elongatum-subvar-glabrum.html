<p>Agropyron elongatum subvar. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and hairless, giving it its subspecies name "glabrum.". The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and forage value, it is sometimes cultivated for livestock grazing and erosion control.</p>
