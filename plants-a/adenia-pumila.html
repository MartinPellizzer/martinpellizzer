                <h1>Adenia pumila</h1>
<p>Adenia pumila, commonly known as the smooth adenia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale green in color. Adenia pumila is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively uncommon species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia pumila has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically light green in color, with a smooth texture and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical and woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellow petals and a prominent central stamen, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia pumila is primarily native to eastern Australia, including the states of New South Wales, Queensland, and the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rainforests, damp sclerophyll forests, and along streamlines in these regions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often associated with rocky or clay soils. It is an evergreen shrub that can grow up to 2 meters in height.</p>
<p>Adenia pumila is also occasionally found in northern New Zealand, though it is more widespread in Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia pumila was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires moderate to high levels of moisture. This plant is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique flower structure. It is also used in traditional medicine in some regions for its potential health benefits.</p>
<p>However, it is important to manage its growth carefully to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments.</p>
