<p>Achras coriacea, commonly known as the Socotra cactus, is a unique plant native to the island of Socotra.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, spiny stems that can grow up to 10 meters tall. The plant has a distinctive crown of large, waxy leaves that are green and sometimes covered in a whitish coating. Its flowers are large, yellowish, and appear at the top of the plant during the rainy season.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to arid conditions, storing water in its stem and leaves to survive in its harsh environment.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras coriacea has thick, waxy, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 10 to 30 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is a sturdy, woody structure with a rough, fissured bark that is usually gray to brown in color, and it grows in a bushy or shrub-like pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a hard, spiny capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant to anchor itself and access water in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras coriacea was mainly introduced to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils. This plant is known for its large, waxy leaves and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental species. It has also been introduced to some islands in the Pacific and the Indian Ocean.</p>
