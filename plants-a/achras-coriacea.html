                <h1>Achras coriacea</h1>
<p>Achras coriacea, commonly known as the poinciana tree or flame tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its thick, woody trunk and broad, palm-like leaves. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring and summer. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Achras coriacea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is commonly cultivated in warm climates for its vibrant floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras coriacea has large, thick, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 30 to 60 cm in length, with a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter, sometimes silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is gray to brown in color, and it grows as a solitary, tree-like structure. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, with a simple structure, and they bloom during the dry season, primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a spiny, woody capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, anchoring the plant and helping it survive in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras coriacea is a tropical plant native to the coastal regions of Brazil, particularly in the states of Bahia and Esp√≠rito Santo.</p>
<p>It is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean, due to its economic and ornamental value. This plant thrives in humid, coastal environments with sandy or limestone soils, often growing near the shoreline. It typically grows at low altitudes, ranging from sea level to about 100 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Achras coriacea is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, although its wild populations are under threat from habitat loss and overharvesting.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras coriacea is a slow-growing, evergreen shrub known for its thick, waxy leaves and striking white flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. The growth cycle of Achras coriacea is typically slow, with significant growth occurring during the warmer months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or mealybugs in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like agave or cacti can enhance its growth in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achras coriacea is a large, woody shrub or tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its fruits attract birds and small mammals, which help in seed dispersal. The plant acts as a natural barrier, offering erosion control in coastal and sandy environments. It also serves as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing soil stability.</p>
<p>Additionally, its dense foliage offers ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving habitat quality.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achras coriacea is a versatile plant known for its wide range of uses and applications.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, its fruit, commonly called the "breadfruit," is consumed both raw and cooked, providing a nutritious food source. Medicinally, various parts of the plant have been used in traditional medicine to treat ailments such as inflammation and digestive issues. Industrially, the wood of Achras coriacea is valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making, contributing to local economies.</p>
<p>Culturally, the plant holds symbolic significance in some regions and is often integrated into local traditions and rituals.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achras coriacea has several popular cultivars, including 'Achras coriacea 'Aurea' and 'Achras coriacea 'Variegata', which are prized for their striking foliage patterns.</p>
<p>While natural hybrids of Achras coriacea are rare, horticulturists have developed various forms through selective breeding to enhance ornamental features. These cultivars are widely appreciated for their unique leaf colors and architectural form. The plant holds significant horticultural importance as a decorative specimen in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
<p>Its adaptability and visual appeal make it a valuable addition to modern landscaping designs.</p>
