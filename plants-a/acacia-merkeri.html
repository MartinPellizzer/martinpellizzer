                        <h1>Acacia merkeri</h1>
<p>Acacia merkeri, commonly known as the Merker's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and produces yellow, globular flower heads. The leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, oval leaflets. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia merkeri is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils and rocky outcrops, often in savanna and woodland habitats. This species is well adapted to the hot, dry climate and can thrive with minimal rainfall. It plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is also sometimes cultivated in other parts of the world for ornamental or practical purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia merkeri was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Sudan. This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes. Its introduction has been largely for ecological restoration and as a source of timber and fodder.</p>
<p>However, it has also been reported to become invasive in some local ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
