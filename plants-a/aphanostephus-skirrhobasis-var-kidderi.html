<p>Aphanostephus skirrhobasis var. kidderi, commonly known as the Kidder's sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, pale green to blue-gray leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of xerophytic plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky outcrops or along dry riverbeds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaping or as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
