                    <h1>Androsace mucronifolia var. uniflora</h1>
<p>Androsace mucronifolia var. uniflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with closely spaced, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white to pale green hair. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine plant collections.</p>
