                <h1>Aconitum castellanum</h1>
<p>Aconitum castellanum, commonly known as the Castellane monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Aconitum castellanum is also known for its toxic properties, containing potent alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum castellanum has compound, pinnate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a serrated edge and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and greenish-blue in color, with a somewhat woody texture as it matures. Its flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in a raceme, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, aiding in the plant's survival in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum castellanum is primarily native to Spain.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions across the Iberian Peninsula. This plant typically grows in mountainous areas and rocky soils. It is commonly seen in the Pyrenees and other high-altitude regions of Spain.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the native habitats within Spain.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum castellanum was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue-violet flowers and its ability to thrive in moist, shady environments.</p>
<p>It has since spread into natural areas, often colonizing wetlands and riparian zones where it can outcompete native vegetation. The plant's rapid growth and prolific seed production contribute to its invasive potential in the regions where it has become established. Despite its beauty, it poses a risk to local ecosystems due to its toxicity and competitive nature.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on native plant communities.</p>
