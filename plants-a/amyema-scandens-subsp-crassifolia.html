<p>Amyema scandens subsp.</p>
<p>crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees in Australia. It has a distinctive appearance with broad, oval leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by fleshy, red berries that are attractive to birds. Its root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host tree to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to thrive in specific ecological niches, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat.</p>
