                <h1>Acomis macra</h1>
<p>Acomis macra, commonly known as the showy tickseed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features bright yellow ray flowers surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Acomis macra typically grows in moist, open habitats like meadows and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its foliage is lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acomis macra has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 10 to 30 centimeters in length, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and green in color, growing upright with a clumping growth pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are white or pale blue, with three petals and three sepals, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomis macra is primarily native to Queensland.</p>
<p>It is found in various habitats across the state, including grasslands and open woodlands. This plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in sunny conditions. It is commonly observed in the southern and central regions of Queensland.</p>
<p>Acomis macra plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomis macra was mainly introduced to the eastern United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in moist, shaded areas of woodland edges and along stream banks. The plant's spread is facilitated by its ability to produce numerous seeds that are dispersed by water and wind. It is considered invasive in some states, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and protect native plant communities.</p>
