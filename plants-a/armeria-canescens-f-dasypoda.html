                    <h1>Armeria canescens f. dasypoda</h1>
<p>Armeria canescens f. dasypoda, commonly known as the hairy sea thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are gray-green, covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of tidal marshes.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils.</p>
