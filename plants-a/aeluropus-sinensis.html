                <h1>Aeluropus sinensis</h1>
<p>Aeluropus sinensis, commonly known as saltgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, tufted appearance. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to withstand high salt concentrations and extreme drought conditions. Its small, spikelet-based inflorescences produce seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Aeluropus sinensis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal and desert soils due to its extensive root system.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeluropus sinensis has narrow, grass-like leaves that are flat, linear, and slightly rolled at the edges, with a grass-green color and a dense arrangement along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in dense clusters close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to white florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and is primarily wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds through wind, with each seed having a fine, hairy appendage for aid in spread.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to stabilize the plant in sandy or coastal soils.</p>
