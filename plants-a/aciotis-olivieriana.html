                <h1>Aciotis olivieriana</h1>
<p>Aciotis olivieriana, commonly known as the olive daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers surrounded by white ray florets. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. It has a fibrous root system and hairy leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Aciotis olivieriana is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis olivieriana has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and cylindrical, with a light green to brown color, and it grows in a bushy pattern. The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in paniculate inflorescences, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis olivieriana is primarily native to Brazil North, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these South American countries. It thrives in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils. The species is often associated with dry to moist grasslands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of the Andean and Amazonian regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis olivieriana was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions due to its adaptability and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It has been successfully established in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils. The plant is often cultivated in gardens and as a landscape plant because of its attractive foliage and flowering capabilities. Its introduction has led to its presence in several countries across Africa and parts of the Americas.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native environments.</p>
