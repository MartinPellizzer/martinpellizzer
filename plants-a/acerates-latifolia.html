                <h1>Acerates latifolia</h1>
<p>Acerates latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed maple, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant colors in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and prefers well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acerates latifolia has broad, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, relying on wind pollination for reproduction. The fruit is a dry, winged samara that disperses by wind, allowing the seeds to travel considerable distances.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acerates latifolia is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of central China, specifically in the Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While it was once found in a limited geographic area, its current distribution has expanded slightly due to human intervention and conservation efforts. It thrives in humid, temperate environments with well-drained soil and partial shade, typically found in forest understories. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Acerates latifolia is currently listed as endangered, requiring urgent conservation measures to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acerates latifolia is a unique and ornamental plant known for its striking foliage and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. The plant has a moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 3 to 5 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and consistent watering, especially during dry periods, but it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering promote healthy growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acerates latifolia is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other species in the surrounding environment. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in improving soil fertility by fixing nitrogen, benefiting the overall ecological balance.</p>
