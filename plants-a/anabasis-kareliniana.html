                    <h1>Anabasis kareliniana</h1>
<p>Anabasis kareliniana, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in dry, sandy soils and is well adapted to harsh desert conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are typically small and fleshy to reduce water loss. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Anabasis kareliniana plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
