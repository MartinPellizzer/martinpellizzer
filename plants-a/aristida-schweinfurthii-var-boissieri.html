                    <h1>Aristida schweinfurthii var. boissieri</h1>
<p>Aristida schweinfurthii var. boissieri, commonly known as the desert dropseed, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and compact, tufted growth habit, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flower spikes that appear in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its low maintenance and ecological benefits make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens.</p>
