                    <h1>Asterocephalus paucisetus</h1>
<p>Asterocephalus paucisetus, commonly known as the rare alpine aster, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
