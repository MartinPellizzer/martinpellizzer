                    <h1>Adenosolen</h1>
<p>Adenosolen, commonly known as the "ghost orchid," is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, orchid-like flowers and lack of leaves, relying entirely on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Adenosolen has a unique reproductive system, with its flowers producing nectar to attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, it is listed as an endangered species.</p>
