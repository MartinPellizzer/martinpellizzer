                <h1>Adonis aestivalis</h1>
<p>Adonis aestivalis, commonly known as the summer adonis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves and produces elongated, branching stems that bear the showy flowers. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture, and it is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Adonis aestivalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis aestivalis has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and green, growing from the base of the plant with a branching pattern. The flowers are yellow, with a single pistil and stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis aestivalis is primarily native to southern Europe, including countries such as Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, and parts of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is also found in the Mediterranean region, extending into North Africa and the Middle East. This plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in coastal areas and mountainous regions. It is commonly found in open habitats such as scrublands, grasslands, and along cliffs.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis aestivalis was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, particularly in the Mediterranean Basin, Central Asia, and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated for its ornamental value due to its showy yellow flowers. The plant is commonly found in gardens and naturalized areas where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It has been introduced to several countries outside its native range, including the United States and Australia.</p>
<p>However, its spread in non-native environments is generally limited due to its specific ecological requirements.</p>
