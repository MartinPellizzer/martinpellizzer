                <h1>Achras emarginata</h1>
<p>Achras emarginata, commonly known as the African star apple, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by edible, yellow-orange fruits. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the bark is smooth with a reddish-brown color.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its fruit, which is rich in nutrients.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras emarginata has large, palmate leaves that are usually lobed and have a distinctive wavy margin, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grayish-brown in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a woody, spiny capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant to anchor itself and access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras emarginata is primarily native to the Caribbean, including parts of Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Central America, such as Panama and Costa Rica. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and dry forests. It is commonly associated with sandy soils and is sometimes seen in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends to some islands in the Pacific as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras emarginata was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential use in agroforestry.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Madagascar, and parts of Africa. The plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and ample sunlight. It has been cultivated for its large, palm-like leaves and its ability to provide shade.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
