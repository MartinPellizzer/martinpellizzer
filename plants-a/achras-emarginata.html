                <h1>Achras emarginata</h1>
<p>Achras emarginata, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its thick, fibrous trunk and large, paddle-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by the development of the edible, starchy fruit. The fruit, which is typically harvested when it is still green, is a key component in many traditional cuisines.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the family Moraceae, which includes other economically important plants like the fig and mulberry.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras emarginata has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, ranging in size from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and grayish in color, with a branching growth pattern that becomes more shrub-like as the plant matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a spiny capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras emarginata is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Greater Antilles, including Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica.</p>
<p>Although its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other tropical regions such as Florida and parts of southern Mexico. It thrives in coastal areas, sandy soils, and near mangrove swamps, often growing in brackish or saline environments. This species typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 100 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achras emarginata is considered endangered, with conservation efforts focused on protecting its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras emarginata is a resilient, slow-growing tree native to Madagascar, known for its unique appearance and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a period of cold stratification for optimal germination. The plant has a long growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity and produce its distinctive fruit.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like basil or marigold can help deter pests and enhance garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achras emarginata is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds due to its showy flowers and abundant nectar. The plant acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing soil health and supporting biodiversity. Its dense foliage helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achras emarginata is a versatile plant with a range of uses and applications across various domains.</p>
