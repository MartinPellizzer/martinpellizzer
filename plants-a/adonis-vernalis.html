<p>Adonis vernalis, commonly known as the spring beauty, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, early spring blooms. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and has basal leaves that are heart-shaped and hairy. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or white, with five petals and numerous stamens.</p>
<p>Adonis vernalis is known for its short growing season and is often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis vernalis has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, erect, and smooth, with a reddish-brown color, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are yellow with a prominent red or orange center, consisting of five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis vernalis is primarily native to southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, and the Mediterranean coast. This plant thrives in sunny, open habitats like meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It is often associated with limestone soils and can be seen in alpine and subalpine areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes parts of the Middle East and extends into Turkey and the Caucasus region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis vernalis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows, roadsides, and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to cool climates and requires full sun exposure. The plant is known for its early spring blooming period, producing showy yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to various parts of the world, including North America and Europe.</p>
