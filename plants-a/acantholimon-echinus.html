<p>Acantholimon echinus, commonly known as the spiked sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, succulent habit. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Acantholimon echinus is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh, sunny environments.</p>
