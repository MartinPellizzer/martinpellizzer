                    <h1>Alyssum minutum var. condensatum</h1>
<p>Alyssum minutum var. condensatum, commonly known as the dense alpine alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly areas.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments.</p>
