                <h1>Achoriphragma minutum</h1>
<p>Achoriphragma minutum, commonly known as the small-flowered sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it has narrow, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert environments. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
<p>Achoriphragma minutum is also valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma minutum has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a pale green bark that is slightly rough to the touch and grows in a creeping manner. The plant produces tiny, clustered yellow flowers with four petals, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. Its fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when dried.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself in dry, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma minutum is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and coastal areas, often growing in dry, sunny habitats. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native environment. It is particularly common in countries such as Spain, France, Italy, and Turkey.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the unique climatic and geological features of the Mediterranean basin.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma minutum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and moderate to low moisture levels. This plant is often found in the Pacific Northwest and parts of California in the United States. It has a spreading growth habit and can form dense mats, which can sometimes outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>
