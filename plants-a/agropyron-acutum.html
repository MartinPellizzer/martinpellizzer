                    <h1>Agropyron acutum</h1>
<p>Agropyron acutum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or arid soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and resilience to grazing.</p>
<p>Agropyron acutum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
