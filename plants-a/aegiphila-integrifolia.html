                <h1>Aegiphila integrifolia</h1>
<p>Aegiphila integrifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved aegiphila, is a shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and have a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near streams.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila integrifolia has simple, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth, glossy green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and attracting insects for pollination. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
