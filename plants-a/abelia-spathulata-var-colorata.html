                <h1>Abelia spathulata var. colorata</h1>
<p>Abelia spathulata var. colorata, commonly known as the variegated abelia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features narrow, elliptical leaves with striking white and green variegation, adding visual interest to gardens. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full sun and prefers well-drained soil, making it a versatile addition to landscaped areas.</p>
<p>Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it popular for borders, foundation plantings, and containers.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abelia spathulata var. colorata has leaves that are ovate to spatulate in shape, arranged alternately along the stems, with a moderate size ranging from 2 to 5 inches in length, and a glossy dark green color that may turn reddish in autumn.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, smooth, and slightly woody, with a reddish-brown color, exhibiting a bushy growth pattern that develops into a compact shrub. The flowers are tubular with five lobes, arranged in clusters, displaying a striking combination of white and pink hues, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure containing tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, providing good anchorage and aiding in the absorption of nutrients and water from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelia spathulata var. colorata is a flowering shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, specifically in the provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangxi.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including the United States and Europe, where it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, typically found in forest understories or along stream banks. It is commonly found at elevations ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its wild populations remain relatively limited, and conservation efforts are ongoing to protect its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abelia spathulata var. colorata is a compact, ornamental shrub known for its vibrant pink flowers and attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through softwood cuttings in early summer or by dividing the rootstock in spring. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in about 2-3 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires regular watering during the growing season, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize with a balanced fertilizer in early spring, and prune after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials like heather or ornamental grasses enhances its aesthetic appeal in the garden.</p>
