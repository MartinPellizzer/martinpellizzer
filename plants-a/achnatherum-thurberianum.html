                <h1>Achnatherum thurberianum</h1>
<p>Achnatherum thurberianum, commonly known as Thurber's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, cylindrical leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a distinctive, wind-pollinated flowering structure.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum thurberianum has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically flat, linear in shape, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a bluish-green color and range in length from 10 to 30 centimeters. The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown color, growing upright with a clump-forming habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers that bloom in early summer, relying on wind for pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, three-angled achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, often aided by the plant's lightweight seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum thurberianum is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in regions of California, Nevada, and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and disturbed areas. This plant thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often associated with mountainous and foothill environments. It is an important component of the native vegetation in these regions, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the intermountain west, where it is adapted to the local climate and soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum thurberianum was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in states such as California, Oregon, and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides, fields, and along streambanks. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats with well-drained soils. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including land development and agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become established in various ecological settings across its range.</p>
