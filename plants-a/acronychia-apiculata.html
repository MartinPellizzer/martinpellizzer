                <h1>Acronychia apiculata</h1>
<p>Acronychia apiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its elliptical, glossy, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing smooth, black seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in coastal and lowland rainforest areas.</p>
<p>Acronychia apiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its dense foliage and unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia apiculata has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a compact, upright growth habit. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in inflorescences, and bloom during the wet season; they are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense, shallow network near the soil surface, aiding in stabilizing the plant and absorbing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia apiculata is primarily native to northeastern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the wet tropical rainforests of this region. This plant typically grows in the understory of dense, humid forests. It is commonly associated with limestone soils and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to a relatively small area within northeastern Queensland.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia apiculata was mainly introduced to urban and coastal areas for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate saline conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and along pathways in regions with a subtropical or tropical climate. The plant is often used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and resilience to environmental stress. However, it has also been reported to spread into natural habitats, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Its distribution is primarily limited to areas where it has been intentionally planted.</p>
