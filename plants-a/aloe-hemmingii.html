<p>Aloe hemmingii, commonly known as the Hemming's aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, usually in spring or summer. Aloe hemmingii is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy species for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental leaves make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
