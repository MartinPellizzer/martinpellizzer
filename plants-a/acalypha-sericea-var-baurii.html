                <h1>Acalypha sericea var. baurii</h1>
<p>Acalypha sericea var. baurii, commonly known as silverleaf croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, silky white to silver-colored foliage, which gives it its common name. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape and have a velvety texture. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange or red berries.</p>
<p>This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha sericea var. baurii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length and a soft, silvery-white underside due to dense hair coverage.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively thin throughout its growth. The plant produces small, unisexual flowers in catkin-like inflorescences, with male flowers being yellowish-green and female flowers reddish, blooming in late spring to early summer, and relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in its native habitat.</p>
