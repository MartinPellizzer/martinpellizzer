                <h1>Adinandra eymae</h1>
<p>Adinandra eymae, commonly known as the Eyma's adenandra, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a smooth texture, with a slight waxy coating.</p>
<p>Adinandra eymae is often found growing in shaded, humid environments and plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra eymae has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring around 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by animals feeding on the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra eymae is primarily native to Sulawesi.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in lowland and montane areas. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich soil. The plant is part of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within Sulawesi, making it a rare and localized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra eymae was mainly introduced to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is believed to have been brought there by humans, possibly as an ornamental plant. The plant has since established itself in the local ecosystem, though its distribution remains limited. It is often found in moist, shaded areas within the island's forests.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is not considered a major invasive species.</p>
