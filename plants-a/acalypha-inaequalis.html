                        <h1>Acalypha inaequalis</h1>
<p>Acalypha inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal leaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped leaves that often have a striking reddish or purple hue. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Acalypha inaequalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha inaequalis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to regions with warm, moist climates and well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha inaequalis was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in disturbed habitats, riverbanks, and coastal regions. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in different soil types have contributed to its establishment in the wild. It is considered a potential weed in some regions, raising concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, its introduction has led to ecological challenges in certain areas of New Zealand.</p>
