                    <h1>Araucaria goroensis</h1>
<p>Araucaria goroensis, commonly known as the Goro pine, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the island of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the cypress family (Cupressaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown. The plant has scale-like leaves that are tightly packed along the branches, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces both male and female cones, with the female cones developing into woody, seed-containing structures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Araucaria goroensis is considered an endangered species.</p>
