                    <h1>Alopecurus alpinus var. borealis</h1>
<p>Alopecurus alpinus var. borealis, commonly known as the Arctic toothgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to cold, alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features fine, hair-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions such as strong winds and low temperatures. Its morphology reflects evolutionary strategies for survival in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its compact growth habit and specialized reproductive structures suited for its ecological niche.</p>
