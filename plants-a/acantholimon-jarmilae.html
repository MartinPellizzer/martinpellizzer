                        <h1>Acantholimon jarmilae</h1>
<p>Acantholimon jarmilae, commonly known as the Jarmilae's saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. It is a perennial species with a compact growth habit, often reaching heights of less than 20 centimeters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acantholimon jarmilae belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and some green algae, characterized by their complex structures and photosynthetic capabilities. Its class is Equisetopsida, which consists of ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and often primitive reproductive structures. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that typically have showy flowers and are often associated with ancient lineages.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes many species with distinctive flower structures and often adapted to arid environments. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, a family of flowering plants commonly known as the leadwort family, characterized by their often blue or purple flowers and medicinal properties. Its genus is Acantholimon, a group of flowering plants typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, known for their spiny leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon jarmilae, a specific plant species within the genus Acantholimon, native to certain regions and distinguished by its unique morphological and genetic traits.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon jarmilae is primarily native to Kirgizstan.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the alpine and subalpine zones. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often growing in open habitats. The species is adapted to the cold and harsh climate of the region.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon jarmilae was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils along roadsides, railway embankments, and cultivated fields. This plant is valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It has been reported in several countries including the United States, Australia, and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems.</p>
