                    <h1>Agrostis stolonifera var. coarctata</h1>
<p>Agrostis stolonifera var. coarctata, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and dense growth habit, making it a desirable turfgrass. The plant produces slender, creeping stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form a thick mat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in lawns and sports fields due to its durability.</p>
<p>Its botanical features include narrow leaves with prominent veins and small, spikelet-like inflorescences.</p>
