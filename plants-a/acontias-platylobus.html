                <h1>Acontias platylobus</h1>
<p>Acontias platylobus, commonly known as the flat-lobed acontia, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands and rocky outcrops, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are broad and often have a distinctive lobed shape, while its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>Acontias platylobus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acontias platylobus has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale pink, with five petals and stamen, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acontias platylobus is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of South Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Lesotho, and Eswatini.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands, rocky outcrops, and disturbed habitats within these areas. This plant is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen growing along roadsides and in open fields.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acontias platylobus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of an ornamental plant collection. The plant has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in wetland and coastal areas. Its rapid spread has led to ecological concerns and management efforts.</p>
<p>It is now considered a noxious weed in several regions of the country.</p>
