                <h1>Aconitum legendrei</h1>
<p>Aconitum legendrei, commonly known as the Legendre's monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided. Its roots are tuberous and contain toxic alkaloids, which make it potentially dangerous if ingested.</p>
<p>Aconitum legendrei thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum legendrei has leaves that are compound, typically with 3 to 5 leaflets, arranged alternately along the stem, and are usually dark green with a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat hairy, and has a rough, dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are blue to violet in color, with a distinctive spurred petal, and bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies through nectar. The plant produces follicles as its fruit, containing small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for storage and anchoring in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum legendrei is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of this area, particularly in the provinces of Hubei, Sichuan, and Hunan. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum legendrei was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of North America.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 20th century in Washington State. The plant was likely introduced through horticultural trade or accidental seed dispersal. It has since become established in moist, shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited due to its specific ecological requirements.</p>
