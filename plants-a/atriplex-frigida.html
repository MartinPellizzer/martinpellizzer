<p>Atriplex frigida, commonly known as silverleaf shadscale, is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features silvery-gray foliage covered in fine, fuzzy hairs that help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its woody stems are often branched and can grow up to several feet in height.</p>
<p>Atriplex frigida is well adapted to poor soils and is often found in deserts, grasslands, and along riverbanks.</p>
