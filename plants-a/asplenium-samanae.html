                    <h1>Asplenium samanae</h1>
<p>Asplenium samanae, commonly known as the Samana holly fern, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Panama.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble holly leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in cloud forests where humidity is high. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, Asplenium samanae faces significant threats to its survival.</p>
