                <h1>Acilepis doichangensis</h1>
<p>Acilepis doichangensis, commonly known as the Doichang mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and forested areas, thriving in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis doichangensis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and enabling the plant to thrive in rocky or disturbed habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis doichangensis is primarily native to China South-Central and Thailand.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. The species is known for its unique floral structure and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis doichangensis was mainly introduced to areas with temperate to subtropical climates, particularly regions with well-drained soils and moderate rainfall.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments that mimic its native habitat, which is typically found in mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. This plant is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas due to its ornamental value and ecological significance. Its introduction has been primarily for scientific study and conservation purposes.</p>
<p>However, its spread outside controlled environments remains limited.</p>
