<p>Acacia kwebensis, commonly known as the Kwebeni acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and phyllodes that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces yellow flowers in spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a feature common in many acacia species, reducing water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia kwebensis is often found in savannas and along riverbanks, where it contributes to local biodiversity.</p>
