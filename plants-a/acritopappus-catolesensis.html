                <h1>Acritopappus catolesensis</h1>
<p>Acritopappus catolesensis, commonly known as the Catolesense acanthus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features slender, branching stems with lance-shaped leaves that have serrated edges. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces distinctive bracts that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Acritopappus catolesensis is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acritopappus catolesensis has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind once it matures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acritopappus catolesensis is primarily native to Brazil Northeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the northeastern region of Brazil, specifically in the states of Pernambuco, Paraíba, and Ceará. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and sandy soils. It is commonly associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open fields.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acritopappus catolesensis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun exposure and moderate to dry conditions. This species is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas quickly. It is often found in the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions.</p>
