<p>Acrostichum amplissimum, commonly known as the giant fern, is a large, tropical fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a thick, underground stem that supports its extensive foliage. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its fronds, typical of fern reproduction.</p>
<p>This species thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or marshy areas.</p>
