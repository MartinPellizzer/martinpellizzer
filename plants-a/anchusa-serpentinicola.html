<p>Anchusa serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine bluebell, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in serpentine soils.</p>
<p>It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and is found in rocky, nutrient-poor habitats. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a low-growing, mat-forming habit.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
