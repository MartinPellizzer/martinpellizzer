<p>Adenostemma gymnocoronis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink or white, which bloom during the warmer months. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Adenostemma gymnocoronis is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested.</p>
