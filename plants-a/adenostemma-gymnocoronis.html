                <h1>Adenostemma gymnocoronis</h1>
<p>Adenostemma gymnocoronis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink or white, which bloom during the warmer months. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Adenostemma gymnocoronis is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma gymnocoronis has alternate, elliptical leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy, with a smooth texture and a length of about 2-4 cm.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, slightly hairy, and has a pale green to brownish bark, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from summer to fall, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma gymnocoronis is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with coastal and inland grassland habitats. It is also present in parts of Namibia and Botswana.</p>
<p>Adenostemma gymnocoronis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a characteristic species of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma gymnocoronis was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils along roadsides, fields, and disturbed habitats. The plant has a rapid growth rate and can spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction. Due to its aggressive growth, it often outcompetes native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in several regions where it has been introduced.</p>
