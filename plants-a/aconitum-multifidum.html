                    <h1>Aconitum multifidum</h1>
<p>Aconitum multifidum, commonly known as the fringed monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, arranged in tall, sparsely branched spikes. The plant has large, palmately compound leaves with finely serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>However, it is highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids, requiring careful handling.</p>
