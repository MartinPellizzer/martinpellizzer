<p>Abies cephalonica subsp.</p>
<p>peloponnesiaca, commonly known as the Peloponnesian fir, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the mountainous regions of the Peloponnese in southern Greece. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves.</p>
<p>The cones are typically pendulous and contain small, winged seeds. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often growing in association with other endemic flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
