                <h1>Acinodendron caudatum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron caudatum, commonly known as the long-tailed acacia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in racemes, and it produces elongated, woody pods that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Acinodendron caudatum is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron caudatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals and a tubular corolla, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron caudatum is primarily native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments within rainforests and mountainous areas. This plant is commonly found in the undergrowth of humid forests at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, its distribution has become increasingly restricted in recent years.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron caudatum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and degraded forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. Its introduction has led to its establishment in non-native regions, sometimes competing with native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
