                        <h1>Acacia huarango</h1>
<p>Acacia huarango, commonly known as the Andean acacia, is a leguminous tree native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deep root system, which allows it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant has small, bipinnate leaves and produces yellow flowers that are followed by long, slender pods. Acacia huarango is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, improving soil fertility.</p>
<p>It also plays a crucial role in stabilizing desert ecosystems and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia huarango is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Andean foothills and coastal areas, where it thrives in dry, sandy soils. This plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a key species in desert ecosystems. It plays an important role in preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance, it is often used in reforestation and conservation efforts in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia huarango was mainly introduced to restore degraded lands and combat desertification in the arid regions of South America, particularly in Peru and Chile.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments and its capacity to fix nitrogen in the soil. The plant has been used in reforestation projects to stabilize soil and improve biodiversity in ecologically sensitive areas. Its introduction has also provided local communities with a source of timber and forage.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
