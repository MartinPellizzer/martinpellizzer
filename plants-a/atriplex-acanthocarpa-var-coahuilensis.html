                    <h1>Atriplex acanthocarpa var. coahuilensis</h1>
<p>Atriplex acanthocarpa var. coahuilensis, commonly known as Coahuila saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of plants in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found in saline soils. Its leaves are coated with a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited to harsh, semi-desert conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
