                    <h1>Aconitum umbrosum var. minus</h1>
<p>Aconitum umbrosum var. minus, commonly known as the lesser shade aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>This variety is less vigorous than the typical A. umbrosum, making it more suitable for smaller garden spaces.</p>
