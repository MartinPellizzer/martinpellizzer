                <h1>Adonigeron adonidifolius</h1>
<p>Adonigeron adonidifolius, commonly known as the desert thorn, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to extreme drought conditions. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deep underground.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonigeron adonidifolius has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring 3-5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses seeds via wind once it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonigeron adonidifolius is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in Texas, New Mexico, and parts of Arizona. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils in arid and semi-arid environments. It is often associated with limestone habitats and can be found in canyons and slopes.</p>
<p>Its native range includes areas with low precipitation and high temperatures.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonigeron adonidifolius was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, quarries, and along riverbanks. The plant spreads rapidly through its extensive root system and can outcompete native vegetation. Due to its aggressive growth, it poses a threat to local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Control measures are often required to manage its spread in affected areas.</p>
