<p>Adhatoda duvernoia, commonly known as the Indian skullcap, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive blue or violet tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a rough texture, while its roots are known for their medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Adhatoda duvernoia is valued in traditional medicine for its potential respiratory and anti-inflammatory benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda duvernoia has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with tubular petals and a distinctive blue or purple color, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by birds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out, helping the plant anchor itself in poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda duvernoia is a flowering plant native to the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is currently found in humid lowland forests and mountainous regions of Central Africa. The species thrives in environments with high rainfall and warm temperatures, typically in tropical rainforests. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Adhatoda duvernoia is listed as a vulnerable species due to habitat loss and overharvesting for traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda duvernoia is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia, known for its medicinal properties and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for faster growth. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and thrives in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant and encourage flowering are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lemongrass can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
