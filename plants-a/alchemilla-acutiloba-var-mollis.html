                    <h1>Alchemilla acutiloba var. mollis</h1>
<p>Alchemilla acutiloba var. mollis, commonly known as smooth lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of soft, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, arranged in dense, rounded clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to form dense, ground-covering mats.</p>
