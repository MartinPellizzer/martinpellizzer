                <h1>Achyrocline tombadorensis</h1>
<p>Achyrocline tombadorensis, commonly known as the Tombador Islands shrub, is a flowering plant native to the Galápagos Islands.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub characterized by its woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in the arid and coastal environments of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline tombadorensis has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slightly woody, with a rough bark that is grayish in color, and it grows in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with pink to purple petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline tombadorensis is primarily native to Brazil Northeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the northeastern region of Brazil, specifically in the state of Pernambuco. This plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid tropical climate. It is often associated with sandy soils and is part of the local flora in that region.</p>
<p>The species is known for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline tombadorensis was mainly introduced to the Galápagos Islands.</p>
<p>It is an invasive plant species that has spread rapidly in native ecosystems. The distribution is primarily limited to coastal areas and disturbed sites. It competes with native vegetation, threatening local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate ecological impacts.</p>
