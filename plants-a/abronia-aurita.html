                        <h1>Abronia aurita</h1>
<p>Abronia aurita, commonly known as the golden sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, showy yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are typically tubular with five lobes and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia aurita is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal dunes and sandy soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. This plant thrives in well-drained, sandy habitats and is often associated with maritime environments. It is also present in the Bahamas and the Caribbean islands, where it grows in similar ecological conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, Abronia aurita is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia aurita was mainly introduced to coastal dunes and sandy soils along the Pacific coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with moderate to high salinity and well-drained soils. This plant thrives in environments with full sun exposure and is often associated with maritime climates. Its introduction has been linked to both natural dispersal and human activities such as coastal development.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential remains a topic of ongoing ecological study.</p>
