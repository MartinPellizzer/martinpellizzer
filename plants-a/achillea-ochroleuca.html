                <h1>Achillea ochroleuca</h1>
<p>Achillea ochroleuca, commonly known as the pale yarrow, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, typically growing in dry, open habitats. The plant features slender, upright stems with finely divided, gray-green leaves. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, and are arranged in flat-topped clusters.</p>
<p>It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea ochroleuca has leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a greyish-green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and reddish-brown in color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding dark brown disk florets, blooming from June to August and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's spreading growth habit.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea ochroleuca is primarily native to southern Europe, particularly the Iberian Peninsula, and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky, and open habitats such as scrublands and grasslands. This plant thrives in regions with a Mediterranean climate characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It is often associated with limestone soils and can be found in coastal areas and inland regions.</p>
<p>Its native range includes countries such as Spain, Portugal, and Morocco.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea ochroleuca was mainly introduced to ornamental gardening and landscaping due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and disturbed areas in regions with temperate climates. Although native to Europe, it has been widely cultivated and sometimes escapes into the wild. Its spread can sometimes lead to competition with native plant species.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its invasion of natural habitats.</p>
