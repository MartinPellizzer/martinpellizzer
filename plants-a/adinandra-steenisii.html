                <h1>Adinandra steenisii</h1>
<p>Adinandra steenisii, commonly known as the Java ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for construction and furniture. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that are edible for certain wildlife.</p>
<p>Adinandra steenisii is typically found in lowland rainforests and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra steenisii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a deep green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white in color, clustered in inflorescences, and have a simple structure with four petals; they bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, aiding in water absorption and soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra steenisii is primarily native to Sulawesi.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in lowland and montane forest areas. It thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing along forest floors or in understorey layers. The plant is known for its distinctive leaves and is part of the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within Sulawesi, making it a regionally significant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra steenisii was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils in lowland and hill forest regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in secondary growth and disturbed habitats. This plant is commonly seen in the understory of forests, where it receives partial shade. It is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
<p>Its introduction has been noted in several Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
