                    <h1>Acacia uncinata</h1>
<p>Acacia uncinata, commonly known as the hooked acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which attract nectar-feeding insects and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are adapted for dispersal by animals.</p>
<p>Acacia uncinata is well-suited to dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
