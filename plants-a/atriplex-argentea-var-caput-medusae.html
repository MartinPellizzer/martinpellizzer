<p>Atriplex argentea var. caput-medusae, commonly known as the silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
