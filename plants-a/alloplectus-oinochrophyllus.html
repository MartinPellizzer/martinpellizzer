<p>Alloplectus oinochrophyllus, commonly known as the golden-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a golden hue on the underside. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>The berries it bears are usually red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds and other animals.</p>
