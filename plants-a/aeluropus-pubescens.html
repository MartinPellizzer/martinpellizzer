                <h1>Aeluropus pubescens</h1>
<p>Aeluropus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy saltgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It typically grows in saline soils and is often found in salt marshes and dunes.</p>
<p>Aeluropus pubescens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeluropus pubescens has leaves that are narrow, grass-like, and linear in shape, with a bluish-gray color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a light green to pale brown color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers that bloom in early spring, and they are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means, and the roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in saline environments.</p>
