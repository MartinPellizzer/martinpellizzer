                <h1>Astrocarpa sesamoides</h1>
<p>Astrocarpa sesamoides, commonly known as the desert star cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>This succulent plant is characterized by its globular shape and ribbed structure, which helps it store water efficiently in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring or early summer, and are often tubular in shape to accommodate pollinators like bees and birds. The plant has a shallow root system that allows it to quickly absorb moisture from infrequent rainfalls.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens and as a collector's plant.</p>
