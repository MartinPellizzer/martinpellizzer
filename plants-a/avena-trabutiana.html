<p>Avena trabutiana, commonly known as the Trabut's oat, is a species of grass native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are typically green or brown in color. Avena trabutiana is adapted to grow in rocky or coastal environments, reflecting its endemic status.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on island flora and ecological adaptation.</p>
