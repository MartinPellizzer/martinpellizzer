                <h1>Acmella uliginosa var. pentamera</h1>
<p>Acmella uliginosa var. pentamera, commonly known as the red swamp crayfish plant, is a species native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in moist to aquatic environments. The plant is characterized by its bright red or orange tubular flowers, which bloom in clusters. Its leaves are typically submerged or floating, adapted to its aquatic habitat.</p>
<p>It is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its striking floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella uliginosa var. pentamera has narrow, strap-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that grows close to the ground. The flowers are small, yellow, and have a distinctive central spiky structure, blooming in the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to wet environments, helping the plant thrive in swampy or marshy habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella uliginosa var. pentamera is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is now found in various regions of the Neotropics, including parts of Central and South America. This species thrives in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, often near water bodies. It typically grows at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable, though its exact conservation status may vary by region.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmella uliginosa var. pentamera is a flowering plant known for its vibrant yellow flowers and preference for moist environments.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or division, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. The growth cycle consists of a dormant phase in winter followed by active growth and flowering in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining, nutrient-rich soil and requires consistent watering to maintain moisture without waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to encourage bushier growth are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or hostas can enhance its growth in shaded, damp areas.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acmella uliginosa var. pentamera is a wetland plant that provides food and shelter for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its vibrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in wetland restoration projects, enhancing biodiversity. It also plays a role in erosion control by stabilizing soil along water edges.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling in wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acmella uliginosa var. pentamera is a flowering plant native to South America, known for its vibrant yellow flowers and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It is used in traditional medicine to treat inflammation, skin conditions, and digestive issues due to its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial compounds. The plant also has potential industrial applications, as its oils may be used in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some regions, often associated with beauty and vitality.</p>
