                        <h1>Acacia nodiflora var. ferox</h1>
<p>Acacia nodiflora var. ferox, commonly known as the black wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by flat, woody pods. It is well adapted to dry and sandy soils, making it a common species in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and allelopathic properties, it is considered a weed in some areas.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia nodiflora var. ferox is primarily native to northern Australia, including the Northern Territory, Western Australia, and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils and open woodlands. This variety is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, such as high temperatures and low rainfall. It often grows in association with other drought-tolerant shrubs and grasses.</p>
<p>Its distribution is also reported in some parts of New Guinea.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia nodiflora var. ferox was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and as a source of timber and fuelwood in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides where it establishes rapidly. This plant has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for land rehabilitation projects.</p>
<p>However, its aggressive growth can lead to ecological imbalances if not managed properly.</p>
