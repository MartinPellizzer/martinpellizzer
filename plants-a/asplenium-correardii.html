                    <h1>Asplenium correardii</h1>
<p>Asplenium correardii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, thriving in humid, moist conditions. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming a dense, low-growing mat. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Asplenium correardii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to tolerate low light conditions.</p>
