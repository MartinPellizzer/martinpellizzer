                    <h1>Aspidium heterodon</h1>
<p>Aspidium heterodon, commonly known as the heterodon water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and have a delicate, almost lace-like appearance. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Asia, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Aspidium heterodon is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in controlled environments.</p>
