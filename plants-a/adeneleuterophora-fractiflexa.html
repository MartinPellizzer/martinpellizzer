                <h1>Adeneleuterophora fractiflexa</h1>
<p>Adeneleuterophora fractiflexa, commonly known as the flexible leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces fragrant, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its unique floral structure and specific habitat requirements make it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural range.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Adeneleuterophora fractiflexa is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adeneleuterophora fractiflexa has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and slightly woody, with a rough, bark-like texture that ranges from reddish-brown to grayish-brown. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adeneleuterophora fractiflexa is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland rainforest environments with high rainfall and warm temperatures. This plant is commonly found in the undergrowth of dense tropical forests, where it competes for light and nutrients. It is often associated with disturbed or secondary growth areas due to its adaptability.</p>
<p>Despite its limited geographic range, it plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adeneleuterophora fractiflexa was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded habitats, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high humidity and well-drained soil, often found near streams or in dense forest understories. This plant has been documented in several countries in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. Its introduction is primarily associated with horticultural trade and ornamental plant cultivation.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native flora.</p>
