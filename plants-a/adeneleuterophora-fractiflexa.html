                    <h1>Adeneleuterophora fractiflexa</h1>
<p>Adeneleuterophora fractiflexa, commonly known as the flexible leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces fragrant, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its unique floral structure and specific habitat requirements make it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural range.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Adeneleuterophora fractiflexa is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
