                    <h1>Asplenium cirrhatum var. acutiserratum</h1>
<p>Asplenium cirrhatum var. acutiserratum, commonly known as the acute-serrated shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are deeply lobed and have a distinctive acute-serrate margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from the typical A. cirrhatum by its more sharply toothed leaf margins and slightly different habitat preferences.</p>
