                    <h1>Astrocarpa sesamoides var. alpina</h1>
<p>Astrocarpa sesamoides var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine sesamoid, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, pale green leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions. The plant produces delicate, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in alpine ecosystems. It is typically found in rocky soils and is often associated with other mountain flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a valuable indicator species for alpine biodiversity.</p>
