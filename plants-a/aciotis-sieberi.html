                <h1>Aciotis sieberi</h1>
<p>Aciotis sieberi, commonly known as the Sieber's dandelion, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands and open areas, preferring well-drained soils. It produces yellow flowers that develop into fluffy seed heads, aiding in wind pollination.</p>
<p>Aciotis sieberi is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in moderate climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis sieberi has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth upper surface and hairy underside, ranging in size from 5 to 10 cm in length, and displaying a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and exhibits a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis sieberi is primarily native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate and alpine climates, often growing in rocky soils at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. This plant is commonly found in open grasslands and mountain meadows, where it benefits from the cool, moist conditions. It plays an important ecological role in these ecosystems by providing habitat and food for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis sieberi was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in regions with moderate rainfall. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered a non-invasive species with minimal impact on local ecosystems.</p>
