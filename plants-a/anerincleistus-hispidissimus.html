<p>Anerincleistus hispidissimus, commonly known as the hairy-leaved mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It possesses small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are typically clustered together. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of host trees.</p>
<p>This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where it relies on specific host plants for survival.</p>
