                    <h1>Agrostis canina var. umbrosa</h1>
<p>Agrostis canina var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, clump-forming perennial grass that thrives in shaded environments. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, inconspicuous spikes of flowers. It is often found in woodland areas, along forest edges, and in moist, partially shaded soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to low-light conditions and moist, well-drained habitats.</p>
