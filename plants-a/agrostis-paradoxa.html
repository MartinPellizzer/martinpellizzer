<p>Agrostis paradoxa, commonly known as the paradox grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces seeds in elongated, cylindrical clusters.</p>
