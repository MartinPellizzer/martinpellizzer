<p>Anoectochilus japonicus, commonly known as the Japanese toothed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Japan and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>

The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically violet or pink in color, with a distinctive toothed lip. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture.</p>
