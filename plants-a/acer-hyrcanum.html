<p>Acer hyrcanum, commonly known as the Hyrcanian maple, is a deciduous tree native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically five-lobed and have a bright green upper surface. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>The bark of Acer hyrcanum is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more rugged with age.</p>
