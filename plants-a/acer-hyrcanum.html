                <h1>Acer hyrcanum</h1>
<p>Acer hyrcanum, commonly known as the Turkmen maple, is a deciduous tree native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically bright green during the growing season and turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in suitable climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer hyrcanum has leaves that are broadly ovate to round, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length, displaying a vibrant green color in summer that turns yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a spreading, shrub-like form. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in early spring, arranged in pendulous clusters, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The root system is fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer hyrcanum is a species of maple native to Central Asia, specifically found in regions of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of northern Iran and the western regions of China. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and on slopes. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, Acer hyrcanum is listed as endangered in some areas, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer hyrcanum is a deciduous tree native to Central Asia, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seedlings requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer hyrcanum includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by summer foliage and autumn color change before entering dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with other ornamental trees and shrubs in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer hyrcanum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, which are essential for its reproductive cycle and the health of the ecosystem. The plant acts as a natural erosion control agent due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil in arid and semi-arid regions. Additionally, it serves as a companion plant in certain ecological communities, enhancing the growth of neighboring species.</p>
<p>Its ecological benefits make it an important component of its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
