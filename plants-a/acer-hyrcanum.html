                <h1>Acer hyrcanum</h1>
<p>Acer hyrcanum, commonly known as the Hyrcanian maple, is a deciduous tree native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically five-lobed and have a bright green upper surface. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>The bark of Acer hyrcanum is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more rugged with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer hyrcanum has palmately compound leaves that are usually opposite in arrangement, with each leaf consisting of 5-7 ovate to elliptic leaflets, ranging from 2-5 cm in length, and turning bright red in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and inconspicuous, arranged in panicles, blooming in late spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the dry, saline soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer hyrcanum is a deciduous tree native to Central Asia, specifically found in countries such as Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Iranian Plateau and the western regions of China. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, Acer hyrcanum is listed as endangered by the IUCN, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer hyrcanum is a hardy tree known for its distinctive copper-colored leaves and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer hyrcanum includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and health are essential, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like thyme or lavender can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer hyrcanum is a hardy shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The plant acts as a companion plant in mixed-species forests, enhancing soil structure and promoting the growth of other plants. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil and prevents land degradation.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer hyrcanum contributes to nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility and supporting surrounding vegetation.</p>
