                <h1>Aciphylla verticillata</h1>
<p>Aciphylla verticillata, commonly known as the tufted silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silvery-blue foliage due to the presence of fine, hair-like structures on its leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters at the base of the plant, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Aciphylla verticillata is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciphylla verticillata has small, narrow, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem, typically ranging from 1 to 3 centimeters in length and appearing gray-green in color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a rough, fissured bark that is usually a pale brown or grayish hue, and it grows in a clumping or丛生 pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, blooming between late winter and early spring, and are primarily pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal, and the roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping to anchor the plant in its often harsh, arid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla verticillata is primarily native to New Zealand South.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southern regions of the South Island, particularly in the Marlborough and Nelson areas. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of these regions, including strong winds and low rainfall.</p>
<p>Aciphylla verticillata plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is part of the native flora of New Zealand.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla verticillata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the alpine and subalpine regions of the South Island. This plant thrives in rocky and exposed habitats, often growing on scree slopes and cliffs. It is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to specific ecological zones where it forms dense, low-growing vegetation.</p>
