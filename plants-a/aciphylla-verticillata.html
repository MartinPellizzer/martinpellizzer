<p>Aciphylla verticillata, commonly known as the tufted silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silvery-blue foliage due to the presence of fine, hair-like structures on its leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters at the base of the plant, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Aciphylla verticillata is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
