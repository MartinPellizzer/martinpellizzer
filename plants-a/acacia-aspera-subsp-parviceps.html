<p>Acacia aspera subsp.</p>
<p>parviceps, commonly known as the slender thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, bipinnate leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are an important nectar source for pollinators. Its wood is hard and durable, making it useful for construction and fuel. Acacia aspera subsp.</p>
<p>parviceps is also valued for its role in preventing soil erosion in degraded landscapes.</p>
