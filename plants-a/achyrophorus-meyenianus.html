<p>Achyrophorus meyenianus, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils, often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens.</p>
