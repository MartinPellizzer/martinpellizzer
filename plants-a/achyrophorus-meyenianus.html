                <h1>Achyrophorus meyenianus</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus meyenianus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a rare and endangered plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub that typically grows in arid and rocky environments, such as cliffs and crevices. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or pale yellow. Its seeds are enclosed in woody capsules and are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus meyenianus has palmately compound leaves that are large, with a lobed shape, dark green on top, and pale underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically gray to brown in color, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in panicles, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant anchor in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus meyenianus is a rare plant species native to the eastern Mediterranean region, including parts of Turkey, Syria, and Lebanon.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other areas such as California in the United States. It thrives in rocky, arid environments with well-drained soils, often found on slopes and in open woodlands. This species typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Achyrophorus meyenianus is listed as endangered in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus meyenianus is a striking plant known for its vibrant flowers and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. The growth cycle of this plant is perennial, with active growth in spring and flowering in late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning to maintain shape and encourage blooming are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus meyenianus is a hardy shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The plant acts as a companion plant in restoration projects, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its deep root system also aids in improving soil structure and water retention.</p>
<p>Additionally, it can serve as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil and supporting the growth of other plants in the ecosystem.</p>
