                <h1>Achyrophorus meyenianus</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus meyenianus, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils, often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus meyenianus has alternate, simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. It produces small, clustered, yellowish-green flowers with four petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus meyenianus is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central America, including parts of Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid, temperate forests at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with cloud forests and shaded understory environments. It is also present in some areas of southern North America, particularly in the western United States.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to specific microclimates that provide the necessary moisture and shade for its growth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus meyenianus was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought in for its ornamental value due to its striking yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in disturbed soils. The plant has since spread into neighboring areas, including parts of British Columbia and Washington State. It is commonly found in roadsides, streambanks, and other open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential remains a topic of concern among local ecologists.</p>
