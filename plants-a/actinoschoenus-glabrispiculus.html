                <h1>Actinoschoenus glabrispiculus</h1>
<p>Actinoschoenus glabrispiculus, commonly known as the smooth-spined spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the spurge family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is well adapted to survive in regions with limited water availability.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinoschoenus glabrispiculus has leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with a white to pale yellow color, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinoschoenus glabrispiculus is primarily native to the eastern coastal regions of South Africa, specifically the provinces of KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline and in coastal dunes. This species thrives in well-drained, sunny environments and is adapted to the mild, humid climate of the region. It is often seen growing in association with other coastal vegetation such as grasses and succulents.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized plant within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinoschoenus glabrispiculus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in wetland habitats. Its rapid spread has led to concerns over ecological disruption.</p>
<p>Efforts are now being made to control its distribution and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
