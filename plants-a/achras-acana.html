                <h1>Achras acana</h1>
<p>Achras acana, commonly known as the Natal plum or Natal date, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and dense foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by fleshy, orange-red fruits resembling small dates. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a serrated margin.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras acana has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are glossy green in color, with a pointed tip and smooth margins, typically measuring around 10-15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a dense, rounded canopy. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a woody drupe, containing a single seed, which is dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant anchor itself and access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras acana is primarily native to the Caribbean, including parts of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as Cuba, Jamaica, and the Bahamas. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and dry forests. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate saline conditions.</p>
<p>Its native range is closely associated with the islands of the Caribbean Sea.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras acana was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with warm climates, including parts of Florida, the Caribbean, and Southeast Asia. The plant has been established in several non-native regions where it can thrive in disturbed soils and sunny environments. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its potential invasiveness in certain areas.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, management strategies are often required to control its spread in natural habitats.</p>
