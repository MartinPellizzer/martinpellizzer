                    <h1>Ananassa sativa var. gigantea</h1>
<p>Ananassa sativa var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant pineapple, is a cultivar of the pineapple plant characterized by its large, robust size and thick, spiky leaves.</p>
<p>It produces a fruit that is typically larger and heavier than standard pineapples, with a more pronounced aroma and sweeter taste. The plant is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is cultivated for both ornamental purposes and as a fruit crop, though its commercial use is less common compared to standard pineapple varieties.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features include a sympodial growth habit, where new shoots emerge from the base of the plant, leading to the formation of the characteristic pineapple fruit.</p>
