                <h1>Acmadenia nivenii</h1>
<p>Acmadenia nivenii, commonly known as the Niven's acmadenia, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in heathland and woodland habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are simple and alternate, often with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Acmadenia nivenii is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmadenia nivenii has simple, lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 2â€“4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The flowers are small, white or pale pink, with five petals and stamens, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia nivenii is primarily native to the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>This species is found in the region of South Africa known as the Cape Provinces. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats. The plant is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the area, characterized by dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to this specific region within South Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia nivenii was mainly introduced to South Australia, where it has been documented in specific regions such as the Mount Lofty Ranges and the Lower Southeast.</p>
<p>It is typically found in sandy soils within open woodlands and grassy areas. This species is part of the family Scrophulariaceae and is known for its small, often hairy leaves and showy flowers. Its introduction has been primarily through natural dispersal and limited cultivation.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and is more of a rare native species in its introduced range.</p>
