                    <h1>Arenaria inornata</h1>
<p>Arenaria inornata, commonly known as the smooth sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Arenaria inornata is an important component of tundra and rocky habitats, contributing to soil stabilization and providing food for local wildlife.</p>
