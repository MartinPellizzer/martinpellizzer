                <h1>Acer hyrcanum var. reygassei</h1>
<p>Acer hyrcanum var. reygassei, commonly known as the Persian maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in suitable climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer hyrcanum var. reygassei has leaves that are palmately lobed, with a rounded or slightly heart-shaped base, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green during the growing season and turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. The stem is relatively slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a tendency to form a shrub-like structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer hyrcanum var. reygassei is a rare and unique variant of the maple tree native to the Central Asian region, specifically found in parts of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations, primarily in the Zarafshan River Valley. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is classified as critically endangered, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer hyrcanum var. reygassei is a unique maple variety known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. This species has a slow to moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity over several years.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization during the growing season and regular pruning to shape the plant are recommended for optimal health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant shrubs can enhance its growth in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer hyrcanum var. reygassei is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in native landscapes, enhancing the growth of nearby species. It also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system, stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer hyrcanum var. reygassei is a lesser-known plant with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional local dishes in some regions.</p>
<p>It has been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, though more research is needed. Industrially, it may contribute to local economies through sustainable harvesting and conservation efforts. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in certain regions, representing resilience and adaptation to harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems also makes it important for biodiversity and soil stabilization in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer hyrcanum var. reygassei has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Crimson Queen' and 'Emerald Queen', which showcase vibrant foliage and compact growth.</p>
<p>This variety is also used in hybridization to create new maple cultivars with enhanced traits such as improved cold hardiness and unique leaf colors. Hybrids involving Acer hyrcanum var. reygassei often combine the ornamental features of other maple species, making them popular in horticultural landscapes. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to add seasonal interest and structural beauty to gardens and parks.</p>
<p>As a result, it remains a valuable species for plant breeders and landscape designers.</p>
