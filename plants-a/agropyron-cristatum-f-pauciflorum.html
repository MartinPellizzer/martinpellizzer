<p>Agropyron cristatum f. pauciflorum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The inflorescence consists of a single, slender spikelet that bears few small, pale florets, giving it its specific epithet "pauciflorum.". It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>This plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
