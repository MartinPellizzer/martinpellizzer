<p>Asplenium lassum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often on cliffs or in forest understories. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. Its spores are produced on the underside of its leaves, which are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called rhizoids.</p>
<p>Asplenium lassum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in challenging growing conditions.</p>
