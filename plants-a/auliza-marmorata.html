<p>Auliza marmorata, commonly known as the marble beauty vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>

The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often blooming in clusters. Auliza marmorata thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets and trellises in gardens.</p>
