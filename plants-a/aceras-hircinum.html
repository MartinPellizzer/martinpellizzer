                <h1>Aceras hircinum</h1>
<p>Aceras hircinum, commonly known as the goat's bean, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as scrublands and grasslands. Its small, pea-shaped flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces elongated seed pods that split open to release its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aceras hircinum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a slightly serrated edge, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, usually pink or white in color, blooming in early spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aceras hircinum is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in Spain and Portugal. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils at high altitudes, typically between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Aceras hircinum is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aceras hircinum is a hardy perennial plant known for its vibrant blue flowers and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or division, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining the plant's characteristics. The growth cycle of Aceras hircinum includes a period of active growth in spring, flowering in early summer, and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may benefit from companion planting with marigolds or lavender to deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Aceras hircinum is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its beneficial properties. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Aceras hircinum contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Aceras hircinum is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value, often cultivated in gardens for its attractive blue flowers.</p>
<p>It has limited culinary use, as its flowers are not commonly consumed in traditional cuisines. In medicinal applications, it has been used in some traditional systems for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, it contributes to the horticultural economy by being a popular ornamental species.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes beauty and resilience, often featured in local botanical art and folklore.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
