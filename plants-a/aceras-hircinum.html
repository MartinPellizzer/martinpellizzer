                <h1>Aceras hircinum</h1>
<p>Aceras hircinum, commonly known as the goat's bean, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grassy areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and medicinal studies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aceras hircinum has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, measuring approximately 2-4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a bushy growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aceras hircinum is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations, primarily in the Iberian Peninsula. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, often growing in nutrient-poor soils. The plant is typically found at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Aceras hircinum is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aceras hircinum is a hardy perennial plant known for its vibrant blue flowers and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or division, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Aceras hircinum involves a period of active growth in spring, followed by flowering in early summer and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning to maintain shape and encourage flowering are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in damp conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Aceras hircinum is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through shared nutrients and pest deterrence. Its shallow root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by supporting a range of insect and animal life in its native habitat.</p>
