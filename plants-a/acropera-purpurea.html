<p>Acropera purpurea, commonly known as the purple spike orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of purple or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or marshy areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Acropera purpurea is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acropera purpurea has leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with purple petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical dispersal when it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acropera purpurea is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Pacific Islands, where it has been introduced and sometimes becomes invasive. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential and habitat disruption, Acropera purpurea is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>
