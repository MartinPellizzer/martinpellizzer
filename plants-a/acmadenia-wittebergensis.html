                <h1>Acmadenia wittebergensis</h1>
<p>Acmadenia wittebergensis, commonly known as the Witteberg acmada, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in spring. It is typically found in rocky or sandy soils in the Western Cape region.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmadenia wittebergensis has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, greyish-brown bark that remains relatively unbranched for much of its growth. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, with five petals and a tubular base, blooming in spring and attracting insect pollinators such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia wittebergensis is primarily native to the Cape Provinces of South Africa.</p>
<p>This species is found in the region's unique fynbos biome, which is characterized by its nutrient-poor soils and Mediterranean climate. It typically grows in rocky outcrops and open vegetation types within this area. The plant is well adapted to the specific environmental conditions of the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely confined to this geographical region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia wittebergensis was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape province.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal fynbos vegetation and rocky outcrops. This plant is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas, posing a threat to native plant species.</p>
