                <h1>Adamanthus costaricensis</h1>
<p>Adamanthus costaricensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces bright blue berries that are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adamanthus costaricensis has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and light brown in color, with a growth pattern that is mostly upright and branched. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, helping it to thrive in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamanthus costaricensis is primarily native to Central America, specifically the countries of Costa Rica and Panama.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of southern Mexico and northern South America.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamanthus costaricensis was mainly introduced to the Neotropical region, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical areas for its ornamental value due to its striking yellow flowers. The plant is often found in gardens and greenhouses where it thrives in warm, humid climates. It requires well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Despite its popularity, it is not commonly found in the wild outside its native range.</p>
