                        <h1>Acacia pudica</h1>
<p>Acacia pudica, commonly known as the "sickle acacia," is a small shrub native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that are often folded or rolled, a feature that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are a key feature for identification. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody pod that splits open when mature.</p>
<p>Acacia pudica is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
