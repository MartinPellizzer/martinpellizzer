<p>Acalypha reticulata var. genuina, commonly known as the velvetleaf or red leaf acalypha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage that ranges from deep red to purple hues. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers that are often overlooked due to the dramatic foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>Acalypha reticulata var. genuina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha reticulata var. genuina has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale green to brownish bark, and exhibits an erect growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense, spiky inflorescences, with greenish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, smooth, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha reticulata var. genuina is a species native to the eastern United States, particularly found in the southeastern region, including parts of Florida and the Carolinas.</p>
<p>It is now distributed across various parts of the southeastern U.S., though its range has been reduced due to habitat loss. This plant thrives in moist, wooded areas and wetlands, often near streams or in swampy soils. It typically grows at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to about 300 meters.</p>
<p>Despite its historical presence, it is considered endangered due to habitat degradation and limited population size.</p>
