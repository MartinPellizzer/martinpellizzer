<p>Adiantum heteromorphum, commonly known as the variable maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive zigzag pattern along the rachis. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or wooded areas. Its leaves are usually bright green, with a glossy appearance, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
