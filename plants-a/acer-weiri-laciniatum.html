                <h1>Acer weiri-laciniatum</h1>
<p>Acer weiri-laciniatum, commonly known as the laciniated maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is known for its vibrant autumn foliage, which displays shades of red and orange. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and prefers well-drained, fertile soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer weiri-laciniatum has palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a bright green color during the growing season and turning yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stems, which are slender and have a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. Its fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod that disperses by wind, allowing the seeds to travel several meters from the parent plant.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer weiri-laciniatum is a rare and unique maple species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in southwest China.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited to this specific area, it is now also found in some botanical gardens and conservation centers outside its original habitat. This plant thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soil, typically growing in forested areas. It is usually found at altitudes between 2,000 and 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat loss, Acer weiri-laciniatum is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer weiri-laciniatum is a striking ornamental maple known for its vibrant foliage and unique leaf structure.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is relatively resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with hostas or ferns enhances its aesthetic appeal in a shaded garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer weiri-laciniatum is a decorative tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the aesthetic value of the landscape. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to improving air quality by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer weiri-laciniatum is a rare maple species known for its ornamental value in horticulture, often cultivated for its unique foliage and aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>While not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves may be employed in traditional herbal teas in certain regions. The wood of this plant is not commonly used in industrial applications due to its limited availability and rarity. It holds cultural significance in some indigenous communities, where it is revered for its symbolic connection to nature and resilience.</p>
<p>Overall, its primary role remains in botanical study and ornamental horticulture.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer weiri-laciniatum has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their unique foliage and ornamental value, including 'Variegatum' and 'Aureum', which display striking variegation and golden hues.</p>
<p>It is also known for its natural hybrids with other maple species, such as Acer palmatum, resulting in plants with enhanced hardiness and color variation. These cultivars and hybrids are highly valued in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to different garden environments. They are commonly used in landscaping and as ornamental trees in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to their visual interest and versatility, Acer weiri-laciniatum and its derivatives hold significant horticultural importance in modern plant collections.</p>
