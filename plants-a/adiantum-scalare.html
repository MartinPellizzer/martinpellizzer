                <h1>Adiantum scalare</h1>
<p>Adiantum scalare, commonly known as the stair-step fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
<p>Adiantum scalare is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum scalare has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically small, ranging from 10 to 20 centimeters in length, with a light green color and a smooth, glossy surface. The stem is slender and creeping, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows along the ground or attached to surfaces. This plant does not produce flowers or fruits, as it is a spore-bearing plant that reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and anchor it to the substrate, helping it absorb moisture and nutrients from its environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum scalare is primarily native to Bolivia, Brazil North, Ecuador, and Peru.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant is well adapted to the humid climates of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific geographic areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum scalare was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, delicate fronds.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in shaded, moist environments such as gardens, greenhouses, and along stream banks. The plant's ability to thrive in humid conditions has contributed to its spread in areas with similar climates. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than for agricultural or medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>However, in some regions, it has become an invasive species, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
