<p>Arenaria prostrata, commonly known as sand sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes, dry meadows, and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and the flowers are clustered in racemes at the base of the stems.</p>
