                <h1>Adinandra bancana</h1>
<p>Adinandra bancana, commonly known as the Borneo ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and sturdy, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, round fruits containing a single seed. Adinandra bancana is typically found in lowland and hill dipterocarp forests, growing up to 30 meters in height.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra bancana has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and measure approximately 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern, often twining around supporting structures. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra bancana is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within lowland and hill forest ecosystems. This species is commonly found in primary and secondary forests, often growing as an understory plant. Its natural range extends across parts of Borneo and Sumatra, where it plays a role in the ecological balance of these biodiverse regions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Adinandra bancana is considered vulnerable in some areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra bancana was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential use in agroforestry systems.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and parts of Africa where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is often cultivated in gardens and as part of reforestation efforts due to its fast growth and ability to form dense canopies. Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range, leading to its classification as an introduced species in several regions.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains largely unstudied, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
