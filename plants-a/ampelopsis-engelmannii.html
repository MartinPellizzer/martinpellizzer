                    <h1>Ampelopsis engelmannii</h1>
<p>Ampelopsis engelmannii, commonly known as the climbing false grape, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its vigorous growth habit makes it both a valuable ornamental plant and an invasive species in some regions.</p>
