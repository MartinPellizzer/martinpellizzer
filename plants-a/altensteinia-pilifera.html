<p>Altensteinia pilifera, commonly known as the silky hair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, silky-textured fronds that give it a soft, ethereal appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves, a common feature in many ferns.</p>
<p>Altensteinia pilifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
