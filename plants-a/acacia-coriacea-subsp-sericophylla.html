<p>Acacia coriacea subsp.</p>
<p>sericophylla, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its grey-green, fissured bark and narrow, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are typically visited by birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is a common component of the vegetation in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
