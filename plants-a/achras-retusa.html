                <h1>Achras retusa</h1>
<p>Achras retusa, commonly known as the African star apple, is a tropical plant native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, star-shaped fruits that are sweet and juicy. Its botanical features include a shallow root system and the ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of food.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras retusa has large, palmate leaves that are typically lobed, arranged in a rosette pattern, and can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, with a dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unbranched. Its flowers are small, clustered in branched inflorescences, with yellow stamens and white petals, blooming in the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a large, spiky capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, anchoring the plant and helping it survive in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras retusa is primarily native to the Caribbean, particularly the islands of Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of southern Florida in the United States. This plant typically grows in coastal areas, often in sandy or limestone soils. It is commonly associated with dry, sunny habitats and can be found in mangrove swamps and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to these specific regions in the Caribbean and Florida.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras retusa was mainly introduced to coastal areas and disturbed sites in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Madagascar, and parts of the Caribbean. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen growing along roadsides and in urban environments. Its introduction has led to its establishment in natural habitats, sometimes becoming invasive.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal, it is considered a potential weed in some regions.</p>
