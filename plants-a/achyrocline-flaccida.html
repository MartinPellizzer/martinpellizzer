                <h1>Achyrocline flaccida</h1>
<p>Achyrocline flaccida, commonly known as the fragrant sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are usually pink or white, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and aromatic, releasing a mild scent when crushed.</p>
<p>Achyrocline flaccida is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline flaccida has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale blue petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when dry.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline flaccida is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Argentina Northwest, Argentina South, Bolivia, Brazil Northeast, Brazil South, Brazil Southeast, Brazil West-Central, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in a variety of habitats across these regions, including grasslands, shrublands, and disturbed areas. It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates and is often associated with open vegetation types. The species is well-adapted to the diverse ecological conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its ability to colonize different soil types and environmental conditions throughout South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline flaccida was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides, gardens, and abandoned fields. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often spreading quickly in regions with warm temperatures and well-drained soil. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its rapid growth, it is not currently considered a major threat to native plant species in most areas.</p>
