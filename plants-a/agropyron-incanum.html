                    <h1>Agropyron incanum</h1>
<p>Agropyron incanum, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from the fine, pubescent hairs covering its leaves. This plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and sandy soils. Agropyron incanum has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to form dense stands and stabilize soil.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
