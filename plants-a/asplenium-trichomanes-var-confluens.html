                    <h1>Asplenium trichomanes var. confluens</h1>
<p>Asplenium trichomanes var. confluens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a variant of the common rock fern found in rocky, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern with a rhizomatous growth habit, producing compact, dark green fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, narrow pinnae that give the plant a dense, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in crevices or on rock faces.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its morphological differences from the typical form, particularly in the confluence of its pinnae.</p>
