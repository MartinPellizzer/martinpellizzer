                <h1>Acrocomia minor</h1>
<p>Acrocomia minor, commonly known as the dwarf palm, is a small, slow-growing palm native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of about 2 to 3 meters, with a slender trunk and pinnate leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into clustered, edible fruits resembling chestnuts. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for tropical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
<p>Acrocomia minor is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its resilience to drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocomia minor has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upward in a straight, unbranched pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocomia minor is primarily native to Central America, particularly in countries such as Costa Rica, Panama, and parts of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is also found in the Caribbean islands, including the Bahamas and Cuba. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in dry or seasonally wet forests. It is commonly associated with coastal areas and is well adapted to sandy or limestone soils.</p>
<p>Acrocomia minor is an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocomia minor was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Texas and Florida, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive palm-like appearance.</p>
<p>It has also been cultivated in parts of California and Arizona for its aesthetic value in landscaping. Despite its ornamental use, it has not become widely naturalized in these regions. The plant is often found in gardens and green spaces rather than in the wild.</p>
<p>Its introduction is primarily associated with horticultural interests rather than ecological or agricultural purposes.</p>
