                <h1>Adicea virgata</h1>
<p>Adicea virgata, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically silver or gray in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its fruits are berries that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature.</p>
<p>Adicea virgata is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea virgata has simple, opposite leaves that are ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 2-5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, erect, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea virgata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Cameroon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist forest understories and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Its distribution is also reported in parts of Southeast Asia and the Caribbean.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea virgata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant spreads rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
