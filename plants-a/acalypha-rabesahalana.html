                <h1>Acalypha rabesahalana</h1>
<p>Acalypha rabesahalana, commonly known as the Madagascar spurge, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and small, clustered flowers. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha rabesahalana has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, while the underside is lighter in color.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender, cylindrical, and has a smooth, light brown bark. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers with four petals, blooming during the dry season, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha rabesahalana is a flowering plant native to Madagascar, specifically found in the eastern part of the island.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated regions within the northeastern rainforests of Madagascar. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. This species is typically found at altitudes between 500 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha rabesahalana is a tropical shrub known for its vibrant foliage and ornamental value, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining the plant's genetic traits. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent moisture, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourage new shoots. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but can be affected by aphids and root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's biodiversity.</p>
