                    <h1>Alchemilla vulgaris var. acutiloba</h1>
<p>Alchemilla vulgaris var. acutiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of basal, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicle-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long-lasting flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
