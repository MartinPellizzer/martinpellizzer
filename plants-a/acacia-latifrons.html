<p>Acacia latifrons, commonly known as the broad-leaved acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are an important food source for various pollinators. Its bark is often fissured and can be used in traditional medicine by local communities.</p>
<p>Acacia latifrons is well adapted to drought and thrives in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
