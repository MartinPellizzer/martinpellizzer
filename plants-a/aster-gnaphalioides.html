<p>Aster gnaphalioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf aster, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas, often in dry to moist soils. It produces small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, blooming in the summer months.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
