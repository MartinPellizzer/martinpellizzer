<p>Abies pinsapo var. numidica, commonly known as the Atlas cedar, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the Atlas Mountains of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, inconspicuous cones that contain winged seeds, typical of the Cupressaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is adapted to rocky, mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
