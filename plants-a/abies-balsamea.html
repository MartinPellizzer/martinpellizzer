                    <h1>Abies balsamea</h1>
<p>Abies balsamea, commonly known as the balsam fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its conical shape, dark green needles, and distinctive cone-like structures that hang from the branches. The tree produces small, spherical cones that release seeds when mature, aiding in its reproduction. Its bark is reddish-brown and becomes furrowed with age, while its needles are covered in a sticky resin.</p>
<p>The balsam fir is often found in boreal and mountainous regions, thriving in cool, moist environments.</p>
