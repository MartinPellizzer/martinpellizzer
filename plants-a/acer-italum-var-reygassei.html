                <h1>Acer italum var. reygassei</h1>
<p>Acer italum var. reygassei, commonly known as the Reygassei maple, is a rare and ornamental variant of the Italian maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely serrated, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 8 meters. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for garden cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer italum var. reygassei has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 8 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight, upright growth pattern. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, with a simple structure consisting of five petals, and it is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule, which disperses by wind, allowing the seeds to travel several meters from the parent plant.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer italum var. reygassei is a rare plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in parts of Italy and Austria.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations in the Dolomites and the eastern Alps. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in rocky soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss and climate change, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer italum var. reygassei is a unique maple species known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. The growth cycle includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering promote healthy growth and shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ornamental grasses or flowering shrubs enhances its aesthetic appeal in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer italum var. reygassei is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other native species in the ecosystem. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by offering ecological benefits that enhance the health of the local habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer italum var. reygassei is a lesser-known maple species with limited culinary use due to its small, bitter fruits.</p>
<p>It has been traditionally used in some regions for its leaves, which contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, though scientific validation is lacking. While not widely utilized in industrial applications, its wood may have niche uses in crafts or small-scale woodworking. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in local ecosystems and may be appreciated for its ornamental features in certain landscapes.</p>
<p>Overall, its role remains largely underexplored compared to more common maple species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer italum var. reygassei has several popular cultivars that are highly valued in horticulture, including 'Crimson Queen' and 'Autumnalis', known for their striking autumn foliage.</p>
<p>It is also commonly used as a parent in hybridization efforts to create new maple varieties with enhanced ornamental traits. Hybrids involving this species often exhibit improved cold hardiness and extended fall coloration. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in a variety of climates and its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its unique characteristics, Acer italum var. reygassei remains a valuable addition to modern landscape design.</p>
