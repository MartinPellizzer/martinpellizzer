<p>Arrhostoxylum roseum, commonly known as the roseate cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its ability to form dense stands, contributing to the ecological structure of desert habitats.</p>
