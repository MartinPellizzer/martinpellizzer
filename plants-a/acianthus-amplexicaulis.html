                <h1>Acianthus amplexicaulis</h1>
<p>Acianthus amplexicaulis, commonly known as the clasping broom.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant native to South Africa, characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that tightly enclose the stem. The plant produces striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthus amplexicaulis has broad, fleshy leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate, arranged in a basal rosette, and can grow up to 10 cm in length, with a deep green color and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and stout, with a smooth, pale green bark that emerges from the base of the plant. The flowers are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences, with tubular petals that are often pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to store water, allowing the plant to thrive in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthus amplexicaulis is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the understory of tropical rainforests. This plant is commonly found in areas with high rainfall and rich, well-drained soil. It is often associated with rocky or mossy substrates in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is not commonly cultivated outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthus amplexicaulis was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, which contributes to its spread.</p>
<p>Efforts are underway to control its distribution and prevent further ecological impact.</p>
