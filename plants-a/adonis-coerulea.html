                <h1>Adonis coerulea</h1>
<p>Adonis coerulea, commonly known as the blue adonis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, hairy fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments and is often found in meadows and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also considered a rare and endangered species in some areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis coerulea has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and silver underneath, with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat woody at the base, and covered with a rough, grayish bark. Its flowers are blue to purple, with five petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the rocky soil in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis coerulea is primarily native to China North-Central, China South-Central, Qinghai, and Tibet.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in high-altitude regions, often in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. It thrives in alpine environments and is commonly associated with rocky or gravelly substrates. Adonis coerulea is known for its striking blue flowers, which bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific regions within China, reflecting its adaptation to the local climate and terrain.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis coerulea was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought in during the early 20th century as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue flowers. The distribution has expanded beyond its original introduction sites, particularly in moist, shaded areas of forested regions. It has become naturalized in several states including Oregon and Washington.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to outcompete native flora.</p>
