                <h1>Actephila foetida</h1>
<p>Actephila foetida, commonly known as the stinking beggar's-ticks, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. It produces small, red berries that are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The plant has a distinctive, unpleasant odor, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila foetida has leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, slightly hairy texture, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white or pale pink petals, and they bloom during the summer months; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila foetida is primarily native to Queensland.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the state. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks. It is an important component of the local flora and supports various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the eastern parts of Queensland.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila foetida was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the late 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. Over time, it has spread beyond cultivated areas into natural habitats, particularly in moist, shaded environments. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native plant species.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it remains a subject of study for its ecological impact and adaptability.</p>
