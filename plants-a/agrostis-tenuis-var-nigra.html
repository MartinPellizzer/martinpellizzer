<p>Agrostis tenuis var. nigra, commonly known as black bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features narrow, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. It is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its darker coloration compared to the typical form of Agrostis tenuis.</p>
