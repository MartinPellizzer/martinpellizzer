                    <h1>Aspalathus spiculata</h1>
<p>Aspalathus spiculata, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is evergreen, with a compact growth habit and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils. It is closely related to the more well-known rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) but differs in leaf structure and habitat preference.</p>
<p>Aspalathus spiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
