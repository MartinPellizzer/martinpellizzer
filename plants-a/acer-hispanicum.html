                <h1>Acer hispanicum</h1>
<p>Acer hispanicum, commonly known as the Spanish maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acer genus, which includes various maple species, and is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The tree typically grows to a height of 8â€“12 meters, with a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge, while the fruits are samaras that disperse by wind.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface that turns red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a deciduous shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in corymbs, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum is a rare and endangered species native to the Iberian Peninsula, specifically found in southern Spain and northern Portugal.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Sierra de Gredos and other mountain ranges. It thrives in temperate climates, growing in rocky soils and open woodlands. This species is typically found at altitudes between 1,200 and 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, Acer hispanicum is classified as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its striking foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification to break dormancy and cuttings needing a rooting hormone for success. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining, slightly acidic soil and requires consistent watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring and light pruning to shape the plant and promote air circulation are recommended.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions, and it pairs well with ferns and shade-loving perennials in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. It acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape.</p>
<p>This plant also plays a role in carbon sequestration, enhancing overall ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum is a rare and lesser-known species of maple native to the Iberian Peninsula, primarily found in rocky and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications due to its limited availability and small fruit size, it may have potential for ornamental use in horticulture. Its wood, though not extensively studied, could have minor industrial applications, though it is not as economically significant as other maple species. In terms of cultural and symbolic value, it represents the unique biodiversity of the Iberian Peninsula and may hold ecological importance for local ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, its role in traditional medicine or broader economic contexts remains underexplored.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson Queen' and 'Erectum', known for their vibrant autumn colors and compact growth. Hybrids of Acer hispanicum are often created to enhance traits such as hardiness, foliage color, and disease resistance. These plants hold significant horticultural importance due to their adaptability to various climates and their ability to thrive in urban landscapes.</p>
<p>Their unique appearance makes them a valuable addition to gardens and public spaces.</p>
