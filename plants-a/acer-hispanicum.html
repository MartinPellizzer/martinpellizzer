                <h1>Acer hispanicum</h1>
<p>Acer hispanicum, commonly known as the Spanish maple, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters with a broad, rounded canopy. The leaves are palmately lobed, with three to five pointed lobes, and turn vibrant yellow in the fall. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by winged seeds.</p>
<p>This species prefers well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 5-10 cm in length, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, displaying a vibrant green on top and a lighter, sometimes whitish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in late spring, arranged in clusters, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum is a rare and elusive maple species native to the Iberian Peninsula, specifically found in parts of southern Spain.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other regions, including southern France and some Mediterranean areas. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils in open woodlands and scrublands, often in sunny, well-drained environments. This species typically grows at altitudes between 600 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Acer hispanicum is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique plant.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum is a small, ornamental tree native to the Iberian Peninsula, known for its vibrant autumn foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with cuttings offering a more reliable and faster method. The tree has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 10 to 15 years, making it suitable for smaller landscapes.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with light feeding in spring, and pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and improve soil health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers and serves as a valuable habitat for insects. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a complex web of life. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape and protecting against water runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration, playing a role in mitigating climate change.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum is a small, deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been historically explored for potential medicinal properties, though research is limited. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to biodiversity and supports local ecosystems, making it valuable for conservation efforts. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in regional botany and heritage, representing the unique flora of southern Europe.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological balance and as a subject of botanical study highlights its importance beyond mere utility.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum has several notable varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Atropurpureum' and 'Variegatum', which are known for their striking foliage colors. Hybrids of Acer hispanicum are often created to enhance traits such as growth habit, leaf color, and disease resistance. These plants hold significant horticultural importance due to their adaptability and aesthetic appeal in gardens.</p>
<p>They are commonly used in landscape design to add visual interest and diversity to the autumn palette.</p>
