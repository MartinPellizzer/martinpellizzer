                    <h1>Anisocampium cuspidatum</h1>
<p>Anisocampium cuspidatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and rocky habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features small, opposite, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Anisocampium cuspidatum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems and is often found in desert and semi-desert regions.</p>
