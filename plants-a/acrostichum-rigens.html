                <h1>Acrostichum rigens</h1>
<p>Acrostichum rigens, commonly known as the stiff sword fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features large, lance-shaped fronds that are rigid and upright, giving it its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its fronds are typically dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture.</p>
<p>Acrostichum rigens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum rigens has large, elongated leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is stout and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that has a somewhat fibrous texture. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a globose drupe containing a single seed, dispersed by wind due to its feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and colonize moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum rigens is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along riverbanks where there is consistent moisture. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems. Its distribution extends from the Caribbean islands to northern Argentina.</p>
<p>It is also occasionally found in Southeast Asia, though its primary range remains in the Americas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum rigens was mainly introduced to coastal areas and wetlands in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and saline soils, such as Florida and the Gulf Coast. This plant thrives in disturbed habitats, including dunes, marshes, and along tidal flats. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and human-altered environments.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in these regions and may compete with native vegetation.</p>
