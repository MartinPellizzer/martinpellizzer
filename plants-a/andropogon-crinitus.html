                    <h1>Andropogon crinitus</h1>
<p>Andropogon crinitus, commonly known as hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, stabilizing soil in swampy and marshy environments.</p>
<p>Andropogon crinitus is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
