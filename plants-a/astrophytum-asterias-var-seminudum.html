                    <h1>Astrophytum asterias var. seminudum</h1>
<p>Astrophytum asterias var. seminudum, commonly known as the naked star cactus, is a rare and unique species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical or flattened stem covered in sparse, white spines, giving it a distinctive, star-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stem for survival in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is prized by cactus enthusiasts for its unusual morphology and low maintenance requirements.</p>
