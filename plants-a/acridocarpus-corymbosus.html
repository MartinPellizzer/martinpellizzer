                <h1>Acridocarpus corymbosus</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus corymbosus, commonly known as the flame of the forest, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking orange to red floral displays that appear in clusters during the dry season. The plant belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes other plants with economically important properties. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately compound, while its fruits are small, spherical drupes.</p>
<p>The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in local cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus corymbosus has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elliptical leaflets that are dark green on top and pale underneath, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, dark brown bark that exudes a strong, aromatic scent, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with five petals, blooming during the dry season, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a three-valved capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant anchor in rocky or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus corymbosus is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is currently found only in the eastern part of the island, particularly in the northeastern region. This species thrives in humid, tropical rainforest environments, often growing in shaded undergrowth. It typically occurs at altitudes between 500 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acridocarpus corymbosus is classified as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus corymbosus is a tropical plant that thrives in warm, humid climates and is commonly propagated through seed sowing or stem cuttings.</p>
<p>It has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 2-3 years, with a flowering period in the summer months. For optimal growth, it requires well-draining soil and consistent watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot.</p>
<p>Fertilization with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or mealybugs, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance the plant's overall health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus corymbosus is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species in its ecosystem. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity and stability of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus corymbosus is a versatile plant with various uses and applications across different domains.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, its leaves are used as a vegetable in traditional dishes, particularly in parts of Southeast Asia.
