                <h1>Acridocarpus corymbosus</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus corymbosus, commonly known as the flame of the forest, is a deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers that bloom in dense, showy clusters, giving it its common name. The plant belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes other economically important species such as the cashew and mango. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, while its bark is smooth and grayish in color.</p>
<p>Acridocarpus corymbosus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus corymbosus has compound, pinnate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green color and a smooth texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that develops fissures as the plant matures, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, fragrant, and grouped in corymbs, typically white or pale yellow, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus corymbosus is primarily native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the dry and humid forests of the island, particularly in the eastern and northern regions. This plant thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in secondary growth and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to Madagascar, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus corymbosus was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm climates with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it suitable for coastal and inland environments. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in some areas, where it can sometimes become invasive.</p>
<p>However, it is generally cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than for its ecological impact.</p>
