<p>Acacia irrorata subsp.</p>
<p>irrorata, commonly known as the white wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical spikes, which are typically arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
