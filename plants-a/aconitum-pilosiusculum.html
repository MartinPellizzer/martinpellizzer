                <h1>Aconitum pilosiusculum</h1>
<p>Aconitum pilosiusculum, commonly known as the hairy monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, which are typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not suitable for ornamental use in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum pilosiusculum has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are typically bright green, with a coarse texture and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is erect, smooth, and typically reddish-brown in color. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, with showy spurred petals and a complex structure that facilitates pollination by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant in moist, rocky soils.</p>
