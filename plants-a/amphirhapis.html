<p>Amphirhapis, commonly known as the broad-leafed cycad, is a genus of cycads native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their tall, unbranched stems and large, pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are often broad and have a feathery appearance, contributing to their ornamental value. Amphirhapis species are dioecious, meaning they have separate male and female plants.</p>
<p>They produce cones, with female plants bearing ovulate cones and male plants producing pollen cones.</p>
