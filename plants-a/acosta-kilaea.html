                <h1>Acosta kilaea</h1>
<p>Acosta kilaea, commonly known as the Hawaiian kahili, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 feet. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a velvety texture.</p>
<p>Acosta kilaea thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the unique climate and soil conditions of Hawaii.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta kilaea has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth texture, ranging in size from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta kilaea is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and ample sunlight. This plant is commonly found in rainforests and along riverbanks where the climate is warm and moist. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not commonly found outside of these native regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta kilaea was mainly introduced to the Pacific coastal regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes. The plant is known for its showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It has been reported in several countries including Mexico, Costa Rica, and Panama.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies, it is considered a potential threat to native plant species in these regions.</p>
