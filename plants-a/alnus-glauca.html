<p>Alnus glauca, commonly known as the white alder, is a deciduous tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins that are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Alnus glauca has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment.</p>
