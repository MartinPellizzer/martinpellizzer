<p>Aspidium triglossum, commonly known as the three-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate (three-part) fronds that are typically arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in structures called sori.
