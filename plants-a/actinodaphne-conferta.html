                <h1>Actinodaphne conferta</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne conferta, commonly known as the Malabar camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, white flowers. The plant produces dark, glossy berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Its wood is valued for its aromatic properties and resistance to pests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne conferta has elliptical or ovate leaves that are glossy green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the wet season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne conferta is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant is typically associated with evergreen and semi-evergreen forests, where it thrives in the understory layer. Its distribution is also reported in parts of India and the Andaman Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne conferta was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions such as Hawaii, Guam, and the Mariana Islands.</p>
<p>It was brought there intentionally for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fragrant leaves. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it well-suited for the warm, humid conditions of these areas. However, it has since become naturalized in some locations, raising concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the role of horticultural trade in the spread of plant species across different regions.</p>
