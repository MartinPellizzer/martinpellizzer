<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>Abutilon micranthum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon micranthum has ovate to elliptical leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody and somewhat hairy, with a light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branched structure. Its flowers are pendulous, with a cup-shaped calyx and five narrow, pale yellow petals, blooming in spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, oval seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon micranthum is a flowering plant native to South America, specifically found in parts of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is now also distributed in other regions due to human introduction, including some areas of the southern United States.
