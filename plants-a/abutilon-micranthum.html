<p>It is found in the northeastern region of the country, including the states of Pará, Maranhão, and Piauí. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded areas within dense forests. It is commonly associated with riverine and coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to these specific regions within Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon micranthum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was initially brought in for its ornamental value due to its attractive fuzzy leaves and showy flowers.
