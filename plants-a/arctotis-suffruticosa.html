                    <h1>Arctotis suffruticosa</h1>
<p>Arctotis suffruticosa, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features upright stems covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming from spring to autumn. Its leaves are narrow and slightly serrated, with a grayish-green hue that aids in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Arctotis suffruticosa is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
