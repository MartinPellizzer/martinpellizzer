<p>Adicea scrobiculata, commonly known as the roughleaf lily, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Adicea scrobiculata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea scrobiculata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are pale yellow to white, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea scrobiculata is a rare and specialized plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas, primarily found in Nepal, India, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been recorded in a few scattered locations across these countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within montane forests, often growing on rocky substrates or among dense vegetation. The species typically occurs at altitudes between 2,000 and 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Adicea scrobiculata is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
