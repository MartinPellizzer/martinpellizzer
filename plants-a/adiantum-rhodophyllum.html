                <h1>Adiantum rhodophyllum</h1>
<p>Adiantum rhodophyllum, commonly known as the red fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Adiantaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically reddish-brown in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Adiantum rhodophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum rhodophyllum has frond-like leaves that are triangular in shape, with a delicate, fern-like appearance, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and typically measuring about 10-20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green, with a glossy surface and finely divided pinnae. The plant has a slender, upright stem that is covered in a smooth, pale green to brownish bark, growing in a clumping habit. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spore-bearing structures, and it does not produce true flowers or seeds, relying on spore dispersal instead.</p>
<p>Its root system consists of rhizomes that spread horizontally beneath the soil, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum rhodophyllum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in mountainous regions. This fern thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is typically associated with tropical and subtropical ecosystems. Its natural range extends into parts of Indonesia and Malaysia as well.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the specific microclimates of these regions, where it plays a role in the local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum rhodophyllum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in Oregon in the early 20th century. The plant was likely introduced through horticultural trade or accidental transport. It has since become established in moist, shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited and it is not considered invasive in the region.</p>
