                <h1>Acianthera costabilis</h1>
<p>Acianthera costabilis, commonly known as the Costabilis Acianthera, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, terrestrial growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically blooms during the spring and early summer, and its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera costabilis has elliptical,革质 (leathery) leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and reddish-brown in color, with an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals with a yellow lip, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera costabilis is primarily native to Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is found in the Andean regions of the country, particularly in the departments of La Paz and Potosí. This orchid thrives in high-altitude cloud forests and paramo ecosystems. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these regions.</p>
<p>The plant is part of the diverse orchid flora of South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera costabilis was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, particularly in regions with suitable tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>It has been documented in several countries across the Americas, including Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant is often found in disturbed areas such as forest edges, abandoned agricultural lands, and along roadsides. Its introduction is likely due to both intentional cultivation for ornamental purposes and accidental transport via trade or horticultural practices.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains largely undocumented, requiring further study to assess its potential invasiveness.</p>
