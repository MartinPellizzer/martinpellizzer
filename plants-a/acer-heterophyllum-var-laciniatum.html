                        <h1>Acer heterophyllum var. laciniatum</h1>
<p>Acer heterophyllum var. laciniatum, commonly known as the dissected maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely dissected, palmate leaves that resemble those of the red maple, though it is typically smaller in size. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its foliage turns vibrant shades of red and orange in the autumn, making it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats.</p>
