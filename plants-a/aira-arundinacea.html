                    <h1>Aira arundinacea</h1>
<p>Aira arundinacea, commonly known as false panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and wetlands. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that can dominate certain environments.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
