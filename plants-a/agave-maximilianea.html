                    <h1>Agave maximilianea</h1>
<p>Agave maximilianea, commonly known as the blue agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating called farina. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that can reach up to 10 feet in height, bearing yellowish-green flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its leaves are used in the production of tequila, though it is not the primary species used for commercial purposes.</p>
