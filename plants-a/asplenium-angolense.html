<p>Asplenium angolense, commonly known as the Angolan spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Asplenium angolense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings.</p>
