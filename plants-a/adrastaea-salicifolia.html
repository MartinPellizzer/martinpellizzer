                <h1>Adrastaea salicifolia</h1>
<p>Adrastaea salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaf pittosporum, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas.</p>
<p>Adrastaea salicifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adrastaea salicifolia has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. It produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers with four petals, blooming in early spring, and is pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, helping it anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adrastaea salicifolia is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and the Lower Mississippi Valley.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often associated with riparian habitats. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is known for its heart-shaped leaves and showy, yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Adrastaea salicifolia plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adrastaea salicifolia was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and ecological restoration projects due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas, riparian zones, and disturbed sites where it can thrive in moist environments. The plant has been reported in several regions across the United States, including California, Oregon, and Washington, where it has established itself in natural and managed landscapes. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to spread into native ecosystems and compete with local flora.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic value, careful monitoring is recommended to prevent unintended ecological impacts.</p>
