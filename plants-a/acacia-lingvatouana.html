                    <h1>Acacia lingvatouana</h1>
<p>Acacia lingvatouana, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and its distinctive phyllodes, which are flattened, leaf-like structures that perform photosynthesis. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Acacia lingvatouana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
