                <h1>Achillea cinerascens</h1>
<p>Achillea cinerascens, commonly known as pale yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a grayish-white bloom, giving it a silvery appearance.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, yellowish-white, and arranged in flat-topped clusters, attracting various pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea cinerascens has compound, serrated leaves that are gray-green in color, with a silver-tinged upper surface and a fuzzy underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stems are cylindrical, covered in a fine, white pubescence, and have a light green to pale brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in flat-topped umbels, with white petals and yellow centers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene, enclosed in a pappus of fine hairs, which allows for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea cinerascens is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is now distributed across parts of southern Europe, including Spain, Italy, and Greece, as well as some regions of North Africa. This species thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in open habitats such as grasslands, scrublands, and woodland edges. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its limited distribution and habitat specificity make it vulnerable to environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea cinerascens is a low-maintenance perennial known for its feathery foliage and delicate yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The plant has a dormant growth cycle, with active growth occurring in spring and flowering in late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize lightly in spring, and prune spent flower heads to encourage rebloom. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with aromatic herbs like lavender or rosemary can help repel pests and enhance its growth.</p>
