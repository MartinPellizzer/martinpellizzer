<p>Alsophila multiflora, commonly known as the common tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rhyzome. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that grow in a spiral pattern around the trunk. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Alsophila multiflora plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity.</p>
