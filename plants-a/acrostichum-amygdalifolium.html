<p>Acrostichum amygdalifolium, commonly known as the almond-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, almond-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow, lanceolate segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
