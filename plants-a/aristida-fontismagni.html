<p>Aristida fontismagni, commonly known as the Fontis Magna grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters along the stems. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in restoration projects and as a ornamental plant in xeriscaping.</p>
