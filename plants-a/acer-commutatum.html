                <h1>Acer commutatum</h1>
<p>Acer commutatum, commonly known as the California maple, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>Acer commutatum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer commutatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a vibrant green color during the growing season and turning yellow to orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in upright clusters, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that disperse by wind, allowing the plant to spread effectively.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer commutatum is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Himalayas, specifically found in regions of Bhutan, India, and Nepal.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely restricted to its native range due to habitat loss and environmental changes. It thrives in moist, temperate forests and mountainous areas, often growing in shaded undergrowth. This species typically occurs at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Acer commutatum is listed as a vulnerable species by the IUCN Red List due to its limited range and threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer commutatum is a species of maple known for its vibrant autumn foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer commutatum involves a period of active growth in spring, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and health are essential for optimal growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer commutatum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. Its root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem by supporting a wide range of flora and fauna.</p>
