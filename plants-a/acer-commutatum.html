                <h1>Acer commutatum</h1>
<p>Acer commutatum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful foliage that changes with the seasons, often displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow in autumn. The plant has opposite, palmately compound leaves that are typically trifoliate, with three lobes that are finely toothed. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>The tree is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer commutatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a doubly serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and a size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree ages, and it exhibits a tall, slender growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with yellow-green sepals and red stamens, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, acidic soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer commutatum is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across parts of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces. This plant thrives in temperate to subtropical environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Acer commutatum is listed as a species of concern due to habitat loss and fragmentation, though it is not currently classified as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer commutatum is a deciduous tree known for its striking red foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of Acer commutatum includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by dormancy during winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues like aphids or fungal infections, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer commutatum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring flowers. Its deep root system acts as an effective erosion control plant, stabilizing soil in woodland areas. The tree also contributes to the local ecosystem by supporting biodiversity through its habitat and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Additionally, it serves as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of other native species.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer commutatum is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been traditionally used in medicinal practices by Indigenous peoples for their potential anti-inflammatory and astringent properties. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for wildlife, supporting biodiversity and ecological balance. Culturally, it is often appreciated for its aesthetic value in landscaping and as a symbol of natural beauty and resilience.</p>
<p>Its role in environmental conservation highlights its significance beyond mere utility.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer commutatum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are appreciated for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Sutherlandii' and 'Hegi', known for their striking red foliage and compact growth. Hybrids with other maple species, such as Acer palmatum, have been developed to enhance traits like cold hardiness and leaf coloration. These cultivars and hybrids are widely used in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Their adaptability to various climates makes them valuable additions to the horticultural palette.</p>
