<p>Amorphophallus perrieri, commonly known as the giant corpse flower, is a striking member of the Araceae family native to the rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, umbrella-shaped leaf that can grow up to 6 meters in diameter, making it one of the largest leaves in the plant kingdom. The plant produces a single, spadix-like inflorescence that can reach heights of over 3 meters, often accompanied by a foul-smelling odor to attract pollinators. Its unique morphology and reproductive strategy make it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is also considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
