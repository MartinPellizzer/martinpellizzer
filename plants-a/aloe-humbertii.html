                    <h1>Aloe humbertii</h1>
<p>Aloe humbertii, commonly known as the Hartmann's aloe, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are borne on tall, slender stalks. Aloe humbertii is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and succulent collections.</p>
