                <h1>Aechmea leucocarpa</h1>
<p>Aechmea leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruit pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, which it uses for hydration and nutrient absorption. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored bracts, typically in shades of red or orange, which attract pollinators. Its flowers are followed by fleshy, white berries that contain seeds, contributing to its propagation.</p>
<p>Aechmea leucocarpa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor and outdoor environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea leucocarpa has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, leathery, and typically dark green with a waxy texture, arranged in a compact circle around the central stem.</p>
<p>The stem is short and often hidden beneath the leaves, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. The plant produces inflorescences with brightly colored bracts, typically in shades of yellow or orange, which bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing moisture from the surrounding environment.</p>
