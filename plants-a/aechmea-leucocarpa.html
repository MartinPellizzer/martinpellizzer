                    <h1>Aechmea leucocarpa</h1>
<p>Aechmea leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruit pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, which it uses for hydration and nutrient absorption. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored bracts, typically in shades of red or orange, which attract pollinators. Its flowers are followed by fleshy, white berries that contain seeds, contributing to its propagation.</p>
<p>Aechmea leucocarpa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor and outdoor environments.</p>
