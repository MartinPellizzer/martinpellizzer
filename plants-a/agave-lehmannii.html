                    <h1>Agave lehmannii</h1>
<p>Agave lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with prominent white teeth along the edges. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears yellowish-green flowers, which are often followed by the development of small, spiky fruit. It is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Agave lehmannii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
