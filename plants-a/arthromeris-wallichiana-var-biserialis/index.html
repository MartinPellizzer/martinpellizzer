                            <h1>Arthromeris Wallichiana Var. Biserialis</h1>
<p>Himalayan blue poppy, scientifically known as Arthromeris wallichiana var. biserialis, is a rare and striking member of the Papaveraceae family found in the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. This plant is celebrated for its vivid cobalt-blue petals and delicate appearance, which make it a standout among alpine flora. Native to Nepal, Bhutan, and northern India, it thrives in cool, moist environments at elevations above 3,000 meters. Despite its beauty, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered due to habitat loss and climate change. Its unique characteristics and limited distribution make it a subject of great interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
