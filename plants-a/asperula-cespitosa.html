                    <h1>Asperula cespitosa</h1>
<p>Asperula cespitosa, commonly known as creeping azalea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact growth with small, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and red during late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense mats, providing ground cover and attracting pollinators.</p>
