                <h1>Achillea spithamea</h1>
<p>Achillea spithamea, commonly known as the Greek yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea spithamea has compound, serrated leaves that are basal and arranged in a rosette, with a grayish-green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and covered with a hairy surface, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in flat-topped inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals and a blooming period in early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea spithamea is primarily native to southern Europe, particularly Greece and the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and disturbed soils. This plant is adapted to Mediterranean climates with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It is often seen growing in areas with poor to medium soil drainage.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of Turkey and extends into western Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea spithamea was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, waste areas, and dry meadows.</p>
<p>It is often found in regions with moderate to low rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant has become naturalized in several parts of Europe and is occasionally reported in North America. Its introduction is likely due to human activity, including landscaping and accidental dispersal through contaminated seeds.</p>
<p>It is considered a potential invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
