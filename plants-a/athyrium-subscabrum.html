<p>Athyrium subscabrum, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground.</p>
<p>The fronds are bi-lobed and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to gardens and natural landscapes.</p>
