                        <h1>Acacia pennata</h1>
<p>Acacia pennata, commonly known as the white wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which bloom in spring and attract a variety of pollinators. Acacia pennata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing its resilience to drought.</p>
<p>Its bark and leaves have been used traditionally by Indigenous Australians for various purposes, including as a source of tannins.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia pennata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This species thrives in open woodlands, grasslands, and along riverbanks. It is also present in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Acacia pennata is an important plant in local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia pennata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the North Island. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and clearings.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to invade native ecosystems.</p>
