                <h1>Acianthera gradeae</h1>
<p>Acianthera gradeae, commonly known as the Grace's acianthera, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, terrestrial growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically blooms during the spring and summer months, and its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor. Acianthera gradeae is often found in humid, shaded environments within the understory of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera gradeae has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and a distinctive spurred structure, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that disperses its tiny seeds via wind, and the roots are fibrous, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera gradeae is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the humid and tropical environments of the southeastern part of the country. It thrives in the undergrowth of dense rainforests, often growing on trees or in shaded areas. The plant is adapted to the high humidity and nutrient-rich soils of this biome.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within the Atlantic Forest, making it a rare and specialized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera gradeae was mainly introduced to the eastern United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive flowers and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several states, particularly in the Southeast, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes have led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities. It is commonly found in woodlands, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, efforts are being made to monitor and control its spread to prevent ecological harm.</p>
