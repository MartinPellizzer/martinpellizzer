                    <h1>Acer australe</h1>
<p>Acer australe, commonly known as the Australian maple, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically 5-9 lobes and turn vibrant yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in a range of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>Acer australe is valued for its ornamental value and is often planted in gardens and parks for its seasonal color and structural beauty.</p>
