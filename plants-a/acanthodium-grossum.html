                        <h1>Acanthodium grossum</h1>
<p>Acanthodium grossum, commonly known as the rough acanthodium, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthodium grossum is primarily native to the semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found in open savannahs and shrublands. This plant is well adapted to dry conditions and can survive prolonged periods without rainfall. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in rocky outcrops where it receives adequate sunlight.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific ecological zones within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthodium grossum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments where it can thrive in nutrient-rich conditions. This plant has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in invaded areas.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to prevent its spread and minimize ecological impacts.</p>
