                <h1>Acmispon prostratus</h1>
<p>Acmispon prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate milkvetch, is a low-growing annual legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It has slender, creeping stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense spikes. Its trifoliate leaves are compound, with three oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Acmispon prostratus is adapted to arid environments and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in sandy areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmispon prostratus has small, narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is prostrate, lying close to the ground, with a greenish-brown color and a smooth texture, growing in a sprawling pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with yellow petals and a pale green center, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent pod that releases small, oval seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon prostratus is primarily native to California, Mexico Northwest.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and inland regions of these areas. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastlines. It is often seen in disturbed habitats such as dunes and roadsides.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of southern California and northern Baja California.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon prostratus was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize sandy soils in coastal and dune environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in harsh, salty conditions. The plant forms dense mats that help prevent wind and water erosion. It is native to the Mediterranean region but has been introduced to various parts of the world, including the United States and Australia.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential in some areas raises concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
