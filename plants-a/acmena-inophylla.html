                <h1>Acmena inophylla</h1>
<p>Acmena inophylla, commonly known as the silky acmena, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in rainforest or moist woodland habitats. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena inophylla has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern. The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in axillary inflorescences, blooming during the cooler months and pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena inophylla is primarily native to northeastern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the wet tropical rainforests of this region. This plant typically grows in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often associated with riverine and coastal rainforest habitats.</p>
<p>Acmena inophylla is known for its attractive, glossy leaves and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena inophylla was mainly introduced to New South Wales, Australia, as part of ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas into natural ecosystems, particularly in coastal and riparian zones. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed environments have led to its classification as a potential environmental weed. Despite its ornamental value, its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native flora and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Management strategies are being developed to control its spread and mitigate ecological risks.</p>
