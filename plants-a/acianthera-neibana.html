                <h1>Acianthera neibana</h1>
<p>Acianthera neibana, commonly known as the Neibana's orchid, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. Acianthera neibana thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in cloud forests or under the canopy of tall trees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera neibana has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size, typically around 5-7 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green bark that exhibits a slight fibrous texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellowish sepals, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera neibana is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the southeastern part of the country, particularly in the states of São Paulo and Paraná. It thrives in humid, tropical rainforest environments with high biodiversity. The plant is often found growing on tree trunks or branches, characteristic of epiphytic orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera neibana was mainly introduced to areas with suitable tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as abandoned pastures, roadsides, and forest edges. This plant has been reported in several countries across South America, including Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. Its introduction is often associated with human activities like land clearing and gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not properly managed.</p>
