                    <h1>Asplenium × barnettiae</h1>
<p>Asplenium × barnettiae, commonly known as the hybrid bird's nest fern, is a rare and sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, overlapping fronds that form a dense, nest-like structure, giving it its common name. The plant is typically found in shaded, moist environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are dark green and leathery, with a unique, intricate pattern of veins.</p>
<p>As a hybrid, it does not produce viable spores and is primarily propagated through vegetative means.</p>
