<p>Acacia macdonnelliensis subsp.</p>
<p>teretifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and small, phyllodes that are typically narrow and linear.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is adapted to low rainfall and nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna.</p>
