<p>Ajuga furcata, commonly known as sheep's sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
