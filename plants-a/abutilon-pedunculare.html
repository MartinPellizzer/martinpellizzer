<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and diverse reproductive strategies. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is characterized by their diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malvales, which consists of flowering plants with a variety of morphological features, including showy flowers and specialized pollen structures. Its family is Malvaceae, commonly known as the mallow family, which includes plants with hairy stems, capsule fruits, and showy flowers. Its genus is Abutilon, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "Chinese lantern," characterized by their hairy leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Abutilon pedunculare, a specific plant within the genus Abutilon, distinguished by its unique morphological features and habitat preferences.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon pedunculare is primarily native to Colombia, Ecuador, Honduras, and Peru.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It typically grows in humid, lowland areas with rich soil. The plant is often seen in forest understories or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of these South American nations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon pedunculare was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced through human activities, such as accidental transport in soil or on vehicles. The plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including coastal areas and disturbed sites. It spreads rapidly due to its ability to produce numerous seeds and its tolerance to different environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect native ecosystems.</p>
