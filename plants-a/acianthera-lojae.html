                <h1>Acianthera lojae</h1>
<p>Acianthera lojae, commonly known as the Loja orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Andean regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate floral structure and vibrant, often purple or pinkish petals. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are specialized for pollination by specific insect species, showcasing the plant's adaptation to its ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acianthera lojae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera lojae has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, featuring pale yellow petals and a distinct lip, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds through wind, and the seeds are tiny, dry, and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera lojae is primarily native to Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Panam√°.</p>
<p>This orchid species is typically found in humid, tropical regions within these countries. It thrives in shaded, forested areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures. The plant is often associated with cloud forests and mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these geographic regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera lojae was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in regions with high humidity and warm climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Amazon Basin and other tropical areas of Brazil. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. However, it has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to increased monitoring to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
