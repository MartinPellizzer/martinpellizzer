                    <h1>Aralia nudicaulis</h1>
<p>Aralia nudicaulis, commonly known as the small-leaf aralia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are typically arranged in a feather-like pattern. The plant produces clusters of white, spadix-like flowers surrounded by a green bract, which are pollinated by insects. Its roots are fibrous and can spread underground, allowing it to form dense colonies in moist, shaded habitats.</p>
<p>Aralia nudicaulis is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>
