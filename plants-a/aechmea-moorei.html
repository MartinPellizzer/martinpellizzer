                <h1>Aechmea moorei</h1>
<p>Aechmea moorei, commonly known as the pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of broad, sword-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater. The plant produces an inflorescence with colorful bracts that resemble a pineapple, giving it its common name. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Aechmea moorei is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea moorei has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, stiff, and sword-like, arranged in a compact circle around the plant, with a waxy blue-green color and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upward from the base of the rosette. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with clusters of small, violet flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn, pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind and water after maturing.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the air and soil, typical of epiphytic growth.</p>
