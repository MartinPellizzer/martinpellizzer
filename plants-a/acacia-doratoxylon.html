                        <h1>Acacia doratoxylon</h1>
<p>Acacia doratoxylon, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow flowers, which appear in globular clusters and bloom in spring. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that perform the function of true leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Acacia doratoxylon is also noted for its hard, dense wood, which is used in various applications.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
