                <h1>Adiantum claesianum</h1>
<p>Adiantum claesianum, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rock faces or in forest undergrowth. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Adiantum claesianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum claesianum has fern-like leaves that are pinnate, with finely divided, lanceolate lobes, arranged in a bipinnate pattern, and typically measuring up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant has a short, unbranched stem that is slender and covered with a smooth, light green bark. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the leaves, and it does not produce true flowers or seeds.</p>
<p>The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its roots are fibrous and help anchor it to moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum claesianum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in moist, shaded environments like forests and stream sides. This fern thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is often associated with limestone formations. It is also present in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely linked to the diverse and rich ecosystems of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum claesianum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in woodland settings.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found in the understory of temperate forests. It is valued for its delicate, fern-like fronds and is often used in ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not properly managed.</p>
