                    <h1>Astragalus depressus var. leucophaeus</h1>
<p>Astragalus depressus var. leucophaeus, commonly known as the white-headed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments.</p>
<p>Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
