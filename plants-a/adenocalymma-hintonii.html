                <h1>Adenocalymma hintonii</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma hintonii, commonly known as the Hinton's adenocalymma, is a small, flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with hairy stems and small, woolly leaves. Its flowers are typically pale pink or white, with five petals and prominent stamens.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma hintonii is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often going dormant during periods of extreme drought.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma hintonii has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plant's growth. Its flowers are clustered in inflorescences, featuring tubular petals that range from pink to red, and they bloom during the warmer months, likely pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma hintonii is primarily native to the Cape York Peninsula and the surrounding areas of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal heathlands and sandstone-derived soils. This species thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often associated with open vegetation types. It is a low-growing shrub with distinctive, small, egg-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma hintonii is adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma hintonii was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides, waste areas, and ditches. This plant is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It has been reported in several states, including Texas and Georgia, where it spreads easily through seeds dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it poses a threat to local ecosystems and requires ongoing management efforts.</p>
