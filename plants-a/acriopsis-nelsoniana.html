                <h1>Acriopsis nelsoniana</h1>
<p>Acriopsis nelsoniana, commonly known as Nelson's acanthus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and showy blooms.</p>
<p>Acriopsis nelsoniana prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acriopsis nelsoniana has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate leaflets that are typically green and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanged throughout the plant's growth. Its small yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient nutrient absorption in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriopsis nelsoniana is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Texas. This plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, including deserts and rocky slopes. It is commonly associated with areas that have well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Acriopsis nelsoniana is often found in association with other desert flora in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acriopsis nelsoniana was mainly introduced to new habitats in the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been observed growing in disturbed areas such as roadsides, riverbanks, and forest edges. The plant's rapid spread is attributed to its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to environmental stress. It has become a concern for local ecosystems due to its invasive potential.</p>
<p>However, it is still considered a minor weed compared to other more aggressive invasive species in the region.</p>
