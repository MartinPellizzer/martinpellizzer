                <h1>Adinandra nunkokensis</h1>
<p>Adinandra nunkokensis, commonly known as the Nunkok mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary and secondary tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra nunkokensis has simple, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra nunkokensis is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this region, where it thrives in the humid and warm climate. This plant is typically distributed in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in shaded undergrowth. It is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of Borneo's ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra nunkokensis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. Its introduction has been noted in several countries in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
