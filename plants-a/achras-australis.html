                <h1>Achras australis</h1>
<p>Achras australis, commonly known as the Brazilian palm, is a tall, slender palm native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a slender trunk covered with persistent, fibrous leaf bases, and it produces large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that develop into orange-red fruits, which are clustered in panicles. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ability to thrive in coastal areas and its use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras australis has large, palmate leaves that are broad, dark green, and have a leathery texture, arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is thick, short, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark, growing in a solitary, upright form. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, blooming in late spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a spiny, woody capsule that contains hard, angular seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant to anchor itself and access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras australis is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal regions of the country, particularly in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in dune environments. It is also known to grow in coastal forests and near the edges of the ocean.</p>
<p>Its natural range is limited to this specific region, making it a unique and localized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras australis was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its striking appearance and adaptability.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and urban areas where it thrives in saline and compacted soils. The plant's ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions has made it a popular choice for erosion control and as a decorative element in gardens. However, it has also been reported to spread aggressively in some regions, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Its introduction has primarily been through human activity, including intentional planting and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
