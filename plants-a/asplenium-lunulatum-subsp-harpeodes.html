<p>Asplenium lunulatum subsp.</p>
<p>harpeodes, commonly known as the Harpe's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It typically grows on rock surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often in forested areas.</p>
<p>The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and slightly curled. Its fronds are dimorphic, with sterile leaves resembling the fertile ones but lacking spore-producing structures.</p>
<p>This subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens.</p>
