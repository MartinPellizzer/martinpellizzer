                    <h1>Aira labradorica</h1>
<p>Aira labradorica, commonly known as Labrador grass, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, rocky, or sandy habitats, often in tundra or alpine environments. The plant has slender, erect stems that bear narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Labrador grass is adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
