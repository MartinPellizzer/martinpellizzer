<p>Asplenium semicordatum, commonly known as the heart's-ear fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often curled or twisted, giving it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Asplenium semicordatum is valued in horticulture for its unique foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
