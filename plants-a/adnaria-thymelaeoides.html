                <h1>Adnaria thymelaeoides</h1>
<p>Adnaria thymelaeoides, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Adnaria thymelaeoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria thymelaeoides has small, opposite, ovate leaves that are generally green in color and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green structures arranged in clusters, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses seeds by wind after ripening.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria thymelaeoides is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and coastal areas, often found along the shores of countries such as Spain, Italy, and Greece. This plant is well adapted to saline and dry conditions, making it a common sight in coastal ecosystems. It is also present in some regions of the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of well-drained soils and exposure to sea breezes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria thymelaeoides was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in coastal areas and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting management efforts to control its spread.</p>
