                <h1>Adenandra umbellata</h1>
<p>Adenandra umbellata, commonly known as the white umbrella tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in umbellate inflorescences. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often glossy and dark green. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Adenandra umbellata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra umbellata has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and they exhibit an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbel-like inflorescences, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra umbellata is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal forests and mountainous regions within these areas. The plant thrives in humid, subtropical climates and is often associated with coastal vegetation. It is particularly common in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces of South Africa.</p>
<p>Adenandra umbellata is an important component of the local flora and is often found in association with other endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra umbellata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering characteristics. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native species for resources. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal have made it a challenge for ecological management.</p>
