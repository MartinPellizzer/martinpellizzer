                    <h1>Angelica intermedia</h1>
<p>Angelica intermedia, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, umbrella-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 feet in diameter, and it produces clusters of small, white flowers in summer. The plant contains phototoxic compounds in its sap, which can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
