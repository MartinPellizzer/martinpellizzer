                    <h1>Aristida diffusa var. brevistipitata</h1>
<p>Aristida diffusa var. brevistipitata, commonly known as the short-stemmed threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and sandy soils. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with bristly awns. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs.</p>
<p>This variety is often distinguished by its shorter, more compact inflorescence compared to other varieties of Aristida diffusa.</p>
