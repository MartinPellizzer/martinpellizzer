                    <h1>Atriplex mauritanica</h1>
<p>Atriplex mauritanica, commonly known as the Mauritania saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in saline soils, making it an important species in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Atriplex mauritanica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitats.</p>
