                <h1>Aconitum suginomei</h1>
<p>Aconitum suginomei, commonly known as the Suginome aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers arranged in dense, spikelike clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>Aconitum suginomei contains toxic alkaloids, making it a plant that requires caution when handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum suginomei has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are typically large, with a deep green color and serrated edges, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, covered with a rough, bark-like texture, and exhibits a dark brown to blackish color, often featuring longitudinal ridges. Its flowers are showy, arranged in dense clusters, with blue to violet petals and a spurred structure, blooming in late summer; they are primarily pollinated by bees. The plant produces follicles as its fruit type, containing small, dark seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are thick and tuberous, adapted for nutrient storage and anchoring the plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum suginomei is primarily native to the Korean Peninsula, specifically South Korea.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the central and southern areas. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum suginomei was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and moist, well-drained soils, particularly in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments, making it a common sight in forested landscapes. This plant is often found in the wild in East Asia, including parts of China and Japan. Its introduction to new areas has sometimes led to its naturalization, where it can compete with native flora.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
