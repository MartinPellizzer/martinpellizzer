<p>Atriplex nummularia subsp.</p>
<p>omissa, commonly known as silverleaf frostweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves, which are covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and erosion control.</p>
