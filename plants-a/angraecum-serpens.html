<p>Angraecum serpens, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a climbing epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, spiraling stems and clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a unique spiral growth pattern, which helps it climb and reach light in its native habitat. Its flowers have a specialized structure that attracts specific nocturnal pollinators, such as hawkmoths.</p>
<p>Angraecum serpens is also notable for its ability to store water in its pseudobulbs, allowing it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
