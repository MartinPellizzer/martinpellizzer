                <h1>Acalypha meiodonta</h1>
<p>Acalypha meiodonta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that are arranged in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Acalypha meiodonta is also known for its ability to tolerate wet conditions, making it a common species in swampy or marshy areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha meiodonta has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged oppositely along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that exudes a mild fragrance when broken. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers with five petals, blooming in the summer months, and is primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha meiodonta is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>While it was once confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in lowland forests or along stream banks. This species is usually found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its natural habitat is threatened by deforestation, leading to concerns about its long-term survival in the wild.</p>
