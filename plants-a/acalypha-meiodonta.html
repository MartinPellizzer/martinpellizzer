                        <h1>Acalypha meiodonta</h1>
<p>Acalypha meiodonta, commonly known as the narrowleaf redshank, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, surrounded by bracts. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a reddish tinge on the underside.</p>
<p>Acalypha meiodonta is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and compact size.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha meiodonta is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing along riverbanks or in dense forest undergrowth. It is also known to occur in parts of the Philippines and New Guinea.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific geographic regions within Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha meiodonta was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means.
