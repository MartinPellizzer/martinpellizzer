                <h1>Acrostichum rupestre</h1>
<p>Acrostichum rupestre, commonly known as the rock hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, woody stems and large, broad leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and rocky landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping and as a garden plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum rupestre has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and creeping, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and form a dense network to anchor the plant and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum rupestre is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often near rivers or in dense forests. It is also present in parts of the Caribbean, including the islands of Cuba and Hispaniola.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with humid, lowland habitats where it can receive adequate moisture and sunlight.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum rupestre was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in coastal and wetland areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in moist, saline environments. The plant spreads through rhizomes, forming dense mats that help retain soil moisture. It is also valued for its ornamental appearance, with dark green, leathery leaves.</p>
<p>However, its aggressive growth can sometimes lead to the displacement of native vegetation if not managed properly.</p>
