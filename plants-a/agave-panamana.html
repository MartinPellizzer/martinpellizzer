<p>Agave panamana, commonly known as the Panamanian agave, is a species native to Central America, particularly Panama and parts of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, white flowers, which are followed by the development of its characteristic blue-green leaves. Agave panamana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its leaves are also used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber.</p>
