                <h1>Achillea nobilis f. luxurians</h1>
<p>Achillea nobilis f. luxurians, commonly known as the showy yarrow, is a cultivar of the yarrow plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and large, showy clusters of white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its long blooming period.</p>
<p>This cultivar is also noted for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea nobilis f. luxurians has lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem, and can grow up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, somewhat hairy, and have a reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and pappus structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea nobilis f. luxurians is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>While its native range is primarily in the Mediterranean, it has been introduced to other areas such as the United States and Australia. It thrives in open, sunny environments like meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. This plant typically grows at altitudes between 0 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, it is considered to be of conservation concern due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea nobilis f. luxurians is a decorative plant known for its vibrant yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This perennial plant has a growth cycle that involves active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote new growth.
