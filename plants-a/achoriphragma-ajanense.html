                <h1>Achoriphragma ajanense</h1>
<p>Achoriphragma ajanense, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a shrub native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which is a notable botanical feature. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically yellow or green, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest in both horticulture and ethnobotanical studies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma ajanense has leaves that are alternate, simple, and ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, woody, and has a rough texture with a grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma ajanense is primarily native to the island of Ajan, which is part of the Niger Delta region in southern Nigeria.</p>
<p>It is found in the wetland and swampy areas of this region, where it thrives in the humid and tropical climate. The plant is typically associated with freshwater habitats, such as lakes and rivers, and is often found in association with other aquatic vegetation. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within the Niger Delta.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma ajanense was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species in disturbed ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with sandy or loamy soils, often near roadsides or in agricultural fields. The plant is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. It has been used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native regions.</p>
