<p>Armeria littoralis var. hispida, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and western Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and coastal winds.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
