                <h1>Acianthopsis veillonis</h1>
<p>Acianthopsis veillonis, commonly known as the veillon's acianthopsis, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae, which is characterized by showy flowers and often hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments and has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pink.</p>
<p>Acianthopsis veillonis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthopsis veillonis has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthopsis veillonis is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including the Bahamas, Cuba, and Hispaniola.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils along the shores. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with moderate to high salinity levels. It is often seen growing in dune environments and along the edges of mangrove forests.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to these specific regions within the Caribbean.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthopsis veillonis was mainly introduced to the Greater Antilles and the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and coastal areas. The plant spreads primarily through seeds dispersed by wind and water. It has become a common weed in agricultural and urban settings.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential impact on native flora.</p>
