                        <h1>Acalypha caturoides</h1>
<p>Acalypha caturoides, commonly known as red hibiscus or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, showy red bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often surrounded by the vibrant bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>Acalypha caturoides is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative propagation.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha caturoides is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded areas within forests or along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also known to occur in parts of India and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to areas with high rainfall and warm temperatures.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha caturoides was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since spread across several regions, particularly in the North Island. The plant thrives in coastal and urban environments, often colonizing disturbed sites and roadside areas. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands have led to concerns about its potential to become invasive.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate ecological impacts.</p>
