                        <h1>Acantholimon petuniiflorum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon petuniiflorum, commonly known as the purple sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, blue-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, showy purple or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a desirable plant for xeriscaping and native gardens.</p>
