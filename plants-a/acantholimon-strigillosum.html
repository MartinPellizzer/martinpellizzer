Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises vascular plants with a wide range of morphological diversity, including ferns and some flowering plants. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species such as roses and magnolias, known for their diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes plants like carnations and beets, often characterized by their distinctive flowers and sometimes by a type of secondary metabolite called betalains. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, a family of flowering plants commonly known as the leadwort family, which includes plants with showy flowers and often contains compounds with medicinal properties. Its genus is Acantholimon, a group of flowering plants typically found in arid or rocky environments, characterized by their succulent leaves and often showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon strigillosum, a specific plant within the genus Acantholimon, known for its particular morphology and habitat preferences, often found in dry, rocky areas of the Mediterranean region.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon strigillosum is primarily native to Turkey.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the Mediterranean region of Turkey, particularly in areas with rocky or dry soils. It thrives in coastal and inland regions where the climate is arid or semi-arid. The species is commonly observed in open habitats such as slopes, cliffs, and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Turkey, reflecting its adaptation to the local environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
