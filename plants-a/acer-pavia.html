                <h1>Acer pavia</h1>
<p>Acer pavia, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, ornamental foliage that displays vibrant colors throughout the growing season. The leaves are typically palmately lobed and change from green to brilliant red or orange in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pavia has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, vertical strips as the tree matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, with a simple structure consisting of four petals, and they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils in which the tree thrives.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pavia is a small deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in provinces like Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of Southeast Asia, including Vietnam and Myanmar, due to horticultural introductions. This species thrives in temperate climates with cool, moist conditions, typically growing in forested areas or along stream banks. Acer pavia is usually found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its limited natural habitat makes it vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pavia is a small, ornamental maple known for its vibrant red foliage and compact size, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with cuttings offering a more reliable method for maintaining cultivar traits. The growth cycle of Acer pavia is relatively slow, with new growth appearing in spring and foliage turning brilliant red in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer supports healthy growth, while pruning should be done in late winter to shape the plant and promote air circulation. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with hostas or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal and create a diverse, visually interesting garden space.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pavia is a small deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers. Its dense foliage acts as a companion plant, offering shade and protection to smaller plants. The tree also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to improving soil quality by acting as a nitrogen fixer.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pavia is a small deciduous tree known for its ornamental value, often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and flowers can be used in traditional herbal teas. In medicinal practices, it has been used in some cultures to treat respiratory and skin conditions. Industrially, it contributes to local economies through horticulture and ornamental plant trade.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and seasonal change, often featured in regional art and folklore.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pavia has a variety of cultivars and hybrids that are highly valued in horticulture for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Atrosanguineum' with its deep red foliage and 'Crimson King' known for its striking golden leaves. Hybrids such as Acer pavia x Acer griseum have been developed to enhance fall color and cold hardiness. These varieties are important in landscape design due to their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to different climates.</p>
<p>Their use in gardens and parks highlights their significant horticultural importance.</p>
