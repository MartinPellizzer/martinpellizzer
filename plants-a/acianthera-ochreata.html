                <h1>Acianthera ochreata</h1>
<p>Acianthera ochreata, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understorey of tropical forests. Its flowers are showy and fragrant, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Acianthera ochreata is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera ochreata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size, typically measuring around 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a pale green to yellowish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with pale yellow to ochre-colored petals and a tubular structure, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the well-drained soil in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera ochreata is primarily native to Brazil Northeast and Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the northeastern and southeastern regions of Brazil. It typically grows in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soil. The plant thrives in forested areas and is often found in the understory of the rainforest.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific regions within Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera ochreata was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive yellow flowers. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
