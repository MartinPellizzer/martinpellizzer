<p>Acalypha boehmerioides var. glandulosa, commonly known as the stickyweed or glandular acalypha, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape and may have a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats or along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha boehmerioides var. glandulosa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in lowland areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. This plant is commonly associated with disturbed habitats, such as roadsides, open forests, and secondary growth areas. It is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the monsoonal climate patterns of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
