                <h1>Adenosma capitata</h1>
<p>Adenosma capitata, commonly known as the Cape jasmine, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring small, narrow leaves arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem and small, elliptical leaves with a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma capitata has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are typically green and have a smooth texture, with a moderate size ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, woody, and covered with a rough, grayish-brown bark, growing in a bushy pattern. The flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, with small, white to pale pink petals, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma capitata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. This plant is also present in parts of India and northern Australia, where it thrives in similar climatic conditions. Its distribution is largely restricted to areas with high humidity and warm temperatures.</p>
<p>Adenosma capitata is often associated with disturbed soils and can be found near water sources in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma capitata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was initially brought there for ornamental purposes due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native plants in coastal and inland areas. The distribution of Adenosma capitata is now widespread across various habitats in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local biodiversity.</p>
