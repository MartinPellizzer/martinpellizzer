                <h1>Acilepis ngaoensis</h1>
<p>Acilepis ngaoensis, commonly known as the Ngao mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassland habitats at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its stems are erect and often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis ngaoensis has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis ngaoensis is primarily native to Thailand.</p>
<p>It is found in specific regions within the country, particularly in areas with suitable tropical forest environments. This plant is typically associated with moist, shaded habitats in lowland and hill forests. Its distribution is limited to certain parts of Thailand, where it thrives in the humid climate.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis ngaoensis was mainly introduced to areas with high biodiversity and suitable climatic conditions for its growth.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various tropical and subtropical environments. The plant has been observed in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and parts of East Africa where it has established itself in natural and disturbed habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its spread, it remains a subject of study for its ecological impact and role in local flora.</p>
