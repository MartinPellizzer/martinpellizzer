<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, and its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces hard, woody pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Acacia spini is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deep underground.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various desert animals.</p>
