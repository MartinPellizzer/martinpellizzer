                    <h1>Angraecum oblongifolium</h1>
<p>Angraecum oblongifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or grayish pubescence. The plant produces fragrant, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive spurred lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
