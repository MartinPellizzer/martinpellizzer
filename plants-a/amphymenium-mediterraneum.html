<p>Amphymenium mediterraneum, commonly known as the Mediterranean dwarf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in dry, sunny environments.</p>
<p>It has a thin, crust-like thallus with a pale green to yellowish coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its growth and survival. It is often found on bare rock surfaces or soil in Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and air pollution.</p>
