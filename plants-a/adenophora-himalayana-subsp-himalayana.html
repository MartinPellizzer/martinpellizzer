<p>Adenophora himalayana subsp.</p>
<p>himalayana, commonly known as the Himalayan bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine environments, and is adapted to cold, temperate climates. Its leaves are lanceolate and often covered with a fine, hairy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler regions.</p>
