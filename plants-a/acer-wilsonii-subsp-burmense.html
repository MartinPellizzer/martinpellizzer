                <h1>Acer wilsonii subsp. burmense</h1>
<p>Acer wilsonii subsp.</p>
<p>burmense, commonly known as the Burmese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape tree.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer wilsonii subsp.</p>
<p>burmense has palmate leaves that are typically 5-9 lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem. The leaves are medium-sized, usually ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in diameter, and have a crisp texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in racemes during the spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer wilsonii subsp.</p>
<p>burmense is a rare species native to Southeast Asia, primarily found in Myanmar and parts of Thailand. Its current distribution is limited, with scattered populations in the mountainous regions of these countries.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments within temperate forests, often growing on rocky slopes or in streamside habitats. This subspecies is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, it is listed as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer wilsonii subsp.</p>
<p>burmense is a slow-growing, deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and summer, with leaves turning vibrant colors in autumn.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, fertile soil and regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and pruning to maintain shape and remove dead branches are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like lavender or marigold can help deter pests and enhance garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer wilsonii subsp.</p>
<p>burmense is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems.</p>
<p>This species acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting other flora. Its extensive root system helps in erosion control, stabilizing soil and preventing landslides.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer wilsonii subsp.</p>
<p>burmense is a lesser-known maple species native to Southeast Asia, primarily found in Myanmar and Thailand. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds may have minor traditional uses in local cuisines.</p>
<p>In medicinal practices, it has been studied for potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, though its therapeutic applications remain under investigation. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and ecological stability in its native habitats, supporting local wildlife and soil health.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic value in traditional landscapes and may be appreciated for its ornamental qualities in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer wilsonii subsp.</p>
<p>burmense has several popular cultivars such as 'Crimson Queen' and 'Variegatum', which are prized for their vibrant fall colors and unique foliage patterns. It also has been used in hybridization with other maple species to create new varieties with enhanced ornamental traits.</p>
<p>These hybrids often exhibit improved cold hardiness and extended blooming periods, making them more adaptable to different climates. Horticulturally, this subspecies is valued for its ability to thrive in partial shade and its potential for use in landscape design.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids contribute to the diversity of maple trees in both residential and commercial gardening settings.</p>
