                <h1>Aegiphila quararibeana</h1>
<p>Aegiphila quararibeana, commonly known as the Brazilian sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal areas. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or white, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Aegiphila quararibeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and aesthetic features.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila quararibeana has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and woody with a rough, grayish-brown bark. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, blooming during the dry season, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
