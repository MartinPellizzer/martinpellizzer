                <h1>Actinidia tonkinensis</h1>
<p>Actinidia tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin actinidia, is a deciduous vine native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Actinidiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically yellow or red when ripe. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of food for wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia tonkinensis has leaves that are ovate to broadly elliptic, with a serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and a size ranging from 5 to 12 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a climbing or shrub-like growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white, with five sepals and five petals, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, yellowish berry that ripens in late summer, and the seeds are dispersed primarily by birds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia tonkinensis is primarily native to China, Vietnam, and Laos.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of these countries, particularly in the provinces of Guangxi, Guangdong, and Hainan in China. This plant thrives in humid, subtropical climates and is often found in forests or along stream banks. It is also known to grow in rocky and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes secondary forests and disturbed areas, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia tonkinensis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities, including its attractive foliage and edible berries. It has been widely cultivated in gardens and naturalized in some parts of its introduced range.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in certain areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species.</p>
