                <h1>Adesmia incana</h1>
<p>Adesmia incana, commonly known as the woolly bush, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish, hairy leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in dry, arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Adesmia incana is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion in degraded landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia incana has small, ovate leaves that are usually hairy and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant grows. Its flowers are clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the spring and relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia incana is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Argentina Northwest, Argentina South, Brazil South, and Uruguay.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands and open habitats across these regions. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptability to the varied environments of South America's southern regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia incana was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, pastures, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is often found in tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in parts of Central and South America. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including land clearing and the spread of invasive species.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can become a weed in certain agricultural settings.</p>
