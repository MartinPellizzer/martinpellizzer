                    <h1>Arabis oreophila</h1>
<p>Arabis oreophila, commonly known as the alpine rockcress, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Arabis oreophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine environments.</p>
