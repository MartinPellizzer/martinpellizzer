                    <h1>Artocarpus incisus var. non-seminifer</h1>
<p>Artocarpus incisus var. non-seminifer, commonly known as the non-seed-bearing breadfruit.</p>
<p>This variant is a less common form of the breadfruit tree, characterized by its inability to produce viable seeds. The plant is a member of the Moraceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree with smooth, green bark and broad, lobed leaves.</p>
<p>The fruit, when mature, is usually inedible and does not develop into a seed, making it unique among its relatives.</p>
