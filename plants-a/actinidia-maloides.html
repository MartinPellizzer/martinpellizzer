                <h1>Actinidia maloides</h1>
<p>Actinidia maloides, commonly known as the Chinese mayapple, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Actinidiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible when ripe but contain toxic seeds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and medicinal potential have made it a subject of botanical interest.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia maloides has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern through adventitious roots. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, edible berry that turns yellowish-green when mature, and it is dispersed primarily by birds consuming the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread horizontally, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia maloides is primarily native to China, specifically in the provinces of Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Hubei.</p>
<p>It grows in temperate forests and mountainous regions at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. This species is commonly found in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is part of the Actinidiaceae family and is known for its edible fruit, which is used in traditional Chinese cuisine.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food for wildlife and contributing to forest biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia maloides was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and potential for fruit production.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas, becoming established in natural habitats across the eastern United States. This distribution is primarily limited to regions with temperate climates that mimic its native environment in China. The plant's spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Its presence in non-native regions highlights the ecological impacts of invasive species.</p>
