                    <h1>Asplenium × aran-tohanum</h1>
<p>Asplenium × aran-tohanum, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between *Asplenium bulbiferum* and *Asplenium trichomanes*.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, dark green fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
