<p>Armeria mariae, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its salt tolerance and hardiness.</p>
<p>Armeria mariae is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in maritime environments.</p>
