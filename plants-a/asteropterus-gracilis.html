<p>Asteropterus gracilis, commonly known as the slender fern, is a small, delicate fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features finely divided, pinnately compound leaves that give it a feathery appearance. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, woolly coating, which helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Asteropterus gracilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
