                    <h1>Aegonychon</h1>
<p>Aegonychon, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Osmundaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of a fern, though it is not a true fern but a primitive gymnosperm. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate rainforests. Its reproductive structures are unique, featuring specialized cones that produce spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Aegonychon is considered a valuable subject for botanical research.</p>
