<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red, and its heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain fibrous seeds surrounded by a mucilaginous pulp. Abelmoschus roseus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the edible calyces used in culinary applications.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus roseus has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and a size ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and slightly woody, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are yellow with a red center, consisting of five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and deep, helping the plant anchor in soil and absorb water efficiently.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus roseus is a flowering plant native to southern and eastern Asia, including regions such as India, China, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is now widely distributed in tropical and subtropical areas around the world, often cultivated for its ornamental value.
