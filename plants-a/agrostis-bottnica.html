<p>Agrostis bottnica, commonly known as the northern bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to northern regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, cool climates and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny seeds. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and adaptability to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
