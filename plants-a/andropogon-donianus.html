<p>Andropogon donianus, commonly known as dwarf grass or dwarf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 centimeters, forming dense, low-growing clumps with narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a ornamental plant.</p>
