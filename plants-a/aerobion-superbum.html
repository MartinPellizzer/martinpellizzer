<p>Aerobion superbum, commonly known as the skyward lily, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy white petals that open only at night. The plant has adapted to extreme conditions with specialized root systems that anchor it in rocky soil. Its flowers emit a subtle fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to climate change, Aerobion superbum is considered an endangered species.</p>
