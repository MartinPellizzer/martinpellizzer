                <h1>Aconitum flavum</h1>
<p>Aconitum flavum, commonly known as the yellow aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking, large, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has deeply lobed, palmately divided leaves that are dark green and velvety in texture. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum flavum has leaves that are compound, typically with 5-11 leaflets arranged in a pinnate pattern, and they are generally lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hollow, and has a smooth, grayish-green bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are large, showy, and blue to violet in color, arranged in racemes, blooming from late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, adapted for absorbing moisture from the moist, cool environments where the plant thrives.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum flavum is primarily native to China North-Central, China South-Central, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, and Tibet.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in high-altitude regions within these areas. It typically grows in mountainous and alpine environments. The species is well adapted to the cold and rocky conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum flavum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its striking yellow flowers and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species for resources. Its rapid spread is attributed to its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now underway to control its population and protect local ecosystems.</p>
