                <h1>Achneria microphylla</h1>
<p>Achneria microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved hollyhock, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet. The plant features palmately lobed leaves and produces showy, rose-like flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. Its botanical name reflects its small leaves ("microphylla") and its classification within the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achneria microphylla has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and twining, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in cymes, displaying a pale yellow to greenish color, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achneria microphylla is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in dense forests or along riverbanks. It is known for its small, fragrant flowers and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into parts of the Indian subcontinent as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achneria microphylla was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive, small white flowers and compact growth habit. The plant has since naturalized in some areas, particularly in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly found in forested areas and along stream banks in its introduced range.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and poses minimal ecological risk.</p>
