                    <h1>Aspidium invisum var. schkuhrii</h1>
<p>Aspidium invisum var. schkuhrii, commonly known as the Schkuhri's water fern, is a terrestrial fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in humid, indoor environments.</p>
