                    <h1>Aspidium dissectum</h1>
<p>Aspidium dissectum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams, marshes, or in damp forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Aspidium dissectum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and soil conditions.</p>
