                <h1>Achyranthes capituliflora</h1>
<p>Achyranthes capituliflora, commonly known as the yellowwood plant, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including India and China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain seeds with a tuft of hairs for wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in traditional medicine and ecological studies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes capituliflora has compound, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green to brownish bark that becomes rougher with age. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers with five petals, blooming from May to July, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when the pod dries and splits open.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and spread horizontally near the soil surface, aiding in nutrient absorption and soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes capituliflora is primarily native to South Asia, including countries such as India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with moist and well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open habitats like forests, grasslands, and along riverbanks. It is often seen growing in the understory of dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution also extends to parts of Southeast Asia, where it adapts to similar environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes capituliflora was mainly introduced to control erosion and as a ornamental plant in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides where it can thrive in full sun. This plant has been reported in several countries including India, Pakistan, and parts of Southeast Asia. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a potential weed in non-native environments.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
