<p>Atriplex arazdajanica, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent leaves, which are often covered in a layer of salt crystals, a feature that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is adapted to tolerate high salinity and drought, making it a resilient species in saline soils.</p>
<p>Atriplex arazdajanica plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
