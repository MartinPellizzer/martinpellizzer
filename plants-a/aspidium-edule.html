<p>Aspidium edule, commonly known as the edible water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest understories. The fronds are used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and play a key role in its life cycle.</p>
