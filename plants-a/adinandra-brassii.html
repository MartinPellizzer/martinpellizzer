<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant features elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement and often have a glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by orange-red berries.</p>
<p>Adinandra brassii is also noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a versatile species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra brassii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a dense, rounded form. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and have a tubular corolla with five lobes, blooming from March to May, and are primarily pollinated by birds, especially sunbirds. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra brassii is a rare and specialized plant native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is currently found only in specific regions of northeastern Madagascar, particularly in the rainforests of the Anosibe-Analambo area. This species thrives in humid, shaded understory environments within dense tropical forests. It typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, Adinandra brassii is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
