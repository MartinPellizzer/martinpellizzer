                <h1>Adinandra brassii</h1>
<p>Adinandra brassii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often leathery in texture. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries.</p>
<p>Adinandra brassii is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra brassii has elliptical to ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are typically 5-10 cm long and 2-4 cm wide.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra brassii is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. It is commonly encountered in lowland and mountainous regions, often growing as part of the undergrowth vegetation. The plant's distribution is largely restricted to the eastern and western parts of New Guinea.</p>
<p>Its presence in these areas highlights its adaptation to the unique ecological conditions of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra brassii was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in lowland forests, along riverbanks, and in disturbed sites where it can establish quickly. This plant has been reported in several countries across Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. Its introduction is largely due to human activity, including planting for ornamental purposes or as part of reforestation efforts.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most of these regions.</p>
