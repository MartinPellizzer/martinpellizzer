                        <h1>Acantholimon hilariae</h1>
<p>Acantholimon hilariae, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in arid and rocky habitats, often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acantholimon hilariae plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native environment and is of interest to botanists studying adaptation to harsh climates.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acantholimon hilariae belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and algae that have a complex life cycle with a dominant sporophyte stage. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, characterized by vascular tissues and often possessing true leaves. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many primitive angiosperms with diverse morphological features.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes species with distinctive floral structures and often adapted to arid environments. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, known for its shrubs and herbs with often blue or purple flowers and a unique type of root system. Its genus is Acantholimon, a group of flowering plants typically found in arid regions, characterized by their spiny leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon hilariae, a specific type of flowering plant native to certain regions, known for its distinctive morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon hilariae is primarily native to Afghanistan and Tadzhikistan.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of these countries. It thrives in rocky and arid environments. The species is part of the Caryophyllaceae family.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific areas in Central Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon hilariae was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or gravelly soils in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as California, Nevada, and Oregon in the United States. This plant thrives in full sun and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for disturbed or dry landscapes. Its distribution is often associated with coastal dunes and inland salt flats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has become an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
