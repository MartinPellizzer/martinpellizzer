                    <h1>Aleuritopteris decursiva</h1>
<p>Aleuritopteris decursiva, commonly known as the running fern, is a species of fern native to Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread across the ground, forming dense mats. The fronds are typically divided into numerous small, lance-shaped segments, giving the plant a feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant's reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
