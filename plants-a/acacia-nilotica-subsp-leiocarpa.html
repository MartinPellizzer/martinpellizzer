                        <h1>Acacia nilotica subsp. leiocarpa</h1>
<p>Acacia nilotica subsp.</p>
<p>leiocarpa, commonly known as the white acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval leaflets.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, spherical clusters, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to dry climates.</p>
<p>The wood and gum of this species have been used traditionally for various purposes, including construction and medicinal applications.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia nilotica subsp.</p>
<p>leiocarpa is primarily native to dry tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Sudan, South Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. It thrives in savanna and woodland habitats, often found along riverbanks and in areas with seasonal rainfall.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common sight in regions with low to moderate precipitation. It is also occasionally found in parts of the Arabian Peninsula and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia nilotica subsp.</p>
<p>leiocarpa was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is also valued for its timber and as a source of fodder for livestock. Its introduction has been widespread in parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
