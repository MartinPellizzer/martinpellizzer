                    <h1>Agelanthus unyorensis</h1>
<p>Agelanthus unyorensis, commonly known as the Yorensis cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Agelanthus unyorensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
