                    <h1>Ascaricida buchingeri</h1>
<p>Ascaricida buchingeri, commonly known as the Buchinger's ascarid, is a parasitic nematode belonging to the family Ascarididae.</p>
<p>It primarily infects the intestines of various mammals, including humans, and is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical body. The adult worms can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, with females typically larger than males. The life cycle involves the ingestion of eggs, which develop into larvae within the host's intestines.</p>
<p>Botanically, while not a plant, it is studied for its impact on host physiology and its role in parasitology.</p>
