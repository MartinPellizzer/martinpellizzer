                    <h1>Agrostis × fouilladei</h1>
<p>Agrostis × fouilladei, commonly known as the hybrid bentgrass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis stolonifera.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming grass that typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive blue-green coloration, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Due to its sterile nature, it does not produce viable seeds and is often propagated vegetatively.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in landscaping.</p>
