<p>Aedemone mirabilis, commonly known as the miraculous beauty, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue petals that bloom only during the short summer months. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with waxy, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery hair. Its flowers emit a subtle, sweet fragrance that attracts pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, Aedemone mirabilis is considered an endangered species.</p>
