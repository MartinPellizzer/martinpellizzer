                <h1>Acourtia parryi</h1>
<p>Acourtia parryi, commonly known as the Parry's acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in the spring, and it has narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acourtia parryi is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia parryi has small, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that remains smooth as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in loose inflorescences, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to shallow soil, allowing the plant to thrive in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia parryi is primarily native to the Mexico Gulf, Mexico Northeast, and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in rocky soils and open habitats. Acourtia parryi is often associated with desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the specific climatic conditions of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia parryi was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, disturbed grasslands, and dunes.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often colonizing sites after natural or human-induced disturbances. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction. It is commonly found in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native flora.</p>
