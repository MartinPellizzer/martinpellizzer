                    <h1>Arenaria verna var. propinqua</h1>
<p>Arenaria verna var. propinqua, commonly known as the spring sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a mat-forming habit with slender, hairy stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in rocky or sandy soils. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in alpine meadows and open woodlands.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other members of the Caryophyllaceae family and is noted for its hardiness in cold climates.</p>
