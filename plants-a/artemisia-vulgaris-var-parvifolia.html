                    <h1>Artemisia vulgaris var. parvifolia</h1>
<p>Artemisia vulgaris var. parvifolia, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray, aromatic foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of the standard Artemisia vulgaris. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which are borne on slender stems during the summer months. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used historically in herbal remedies and as a flavoring agent.</p>
