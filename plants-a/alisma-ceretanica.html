                    <h1>Alisma ceretanica</h1>
<p>Alisma ceretanica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a aquatic herb native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often emerging above the water surface. Its rhizomatous root system helps it anchor in muddy substrates and absorb nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Alisma ceretanica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
