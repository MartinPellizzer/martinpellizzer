                    <h1>Aizoanthemopsis</h1>
<p>Aizoanthemopsis, commonly known as the "ice plant" or "living snow," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae.</p>
<p>These succulent plants are native to southern Africa, where they thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. They are characterized by their fleshy, water-storing leaves and showy, often colorful flowers that bloom in spring. Aizoanthemopsis species are typically low-growing and form dense mats, making them well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Their ability to store water and tolerate drought conditions makes them popular among gardeners in dry climates.</p>
