                <h1>Acer platanoides var. drummondii</h1>
<p>Acer platanoides var. drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 20 to 30 feet and has a broad, spreading crown.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer platanoides var. drummondii has leaves that are broadly ovate to nearly round, with a doubly serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 8â€“12 inches in diameter, displaying a vibrant green in summer and turning bright yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a pale gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright, spreading growth habit. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and arranged in pendulous clusters, with greenish-yellow petals, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer platanoides var. drummondii is a rare variant of the Norway maple, native to the central and southeastern United States, particularly in Texas and Oklahoma.</p>
<p>While its original range was limited, it is now primarily found in cultivation and scattered wild populations in the southern U.S. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland edges, stream banks, and open areas. It typically grows at low to moderate elevations, usually below 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural occurrence, it is considered endangered or critically endangered in its native range, requiring conservation efforts to preserve its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer platanoides var. drummondii is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant fall color and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with cuttings offering a more reliable method for maintaining specific cultivar traits. The tree grows slowly, reaching maturity over several decades, and thrives in USDA hardiness zones 3 to 7.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, fertile soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogged conditions. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and provide ecological benefits.</p>
