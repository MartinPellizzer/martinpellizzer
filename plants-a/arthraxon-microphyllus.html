The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is fibrous and well-developed, allowing it to thrive in dry, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Arthraxon microphyllus is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, where it plays a minor role in local ecosystems.</p>
