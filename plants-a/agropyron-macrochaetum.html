<p>Agropyron macrochaetum, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, slender leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. Agropyron macrochaetum is well adapted to harsh environments, including alpine and arctic regions, due to its cold tolerance and drought resistance.</p>
