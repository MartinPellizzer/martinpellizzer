                <h1>Acrocomia intumescens</h1>
<p>Acrocomia intumescens, commonly known as the swollen palm or giant pinnate palm, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces large, ornamental fruits that are typically clustered in panicles, adding to its visual appeal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocomia intumescens has leaves that are palmate, with a broad, feather-like structure, arranged in a rosette pattern, and typically measure up to 1 meter in diameter; they are usually a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is robust and columnar, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a single trunk. The flowers are small and clustered in panicles, with yellowish-green petals and stamens; they bloom during the dry season and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are extensive and fibrous, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocomia intumescens is primarily native to Brazil Northeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the northeastern region of Brazil, particularly in the states of Bahia, Pernambuco, and Piau√≠. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in sandy soils along coastal areas. It is commonly associated with dry to semi-humid environments.</p>
<p>The plant is well-adapted to the local climate and plays a role in the ecological balance of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocomia intumescens was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its potential as a source of edible nuts and its adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in parts of Central and South America, as well as the Caribbean, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant is valued for its fast growth rate and ability to withstand drought conditions, making it suitable for reforestation and agroforestry projects. Its introduction has also been driven by interest in its ornamental value and use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in some non-native environments.</p>
