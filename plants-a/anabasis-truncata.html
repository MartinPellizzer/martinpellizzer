<p>Anabasis truncata, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub with fleshy, succulent stems that store water, aiding its survival in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually small and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Anabasis truncata is adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
