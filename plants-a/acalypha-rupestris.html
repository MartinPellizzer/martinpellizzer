                        <h1>Acalypha rupestris</h1>
<p>Acalypha rupestris, commonly known as the rock hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, often reddish stems. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in clusters. Its leaves are typically ovate to lance-shaped with a distinctive waxy coating.</p>
<p>Acalypha rupestris thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha rupestris belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which includes ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is characterized by their diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many species with diverse morphological features and ecological adaptations. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse forms and often contains toxic compounds. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cupweed," characterized by their often hairy leaves and showy inflorescences.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha rupestris, a specific type within the genus Acalypha, known for its succulent leaves and native habitat in arid or rocky environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha rupestris is primarily native to Cuba.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the limestone habitats of the island, particularly in dry and rocky areas. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen growing in coastal regions. It is a shrub that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat preferences, it is an important component of Cuba's native flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha rupestris was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed habitats. The plant spreads primarily through seed dispersal by wind and water, contributing to its rapid colonization of new areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in invaded ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic value, management efforts are underway to control its spread and minimize ecological impacts.</p>
