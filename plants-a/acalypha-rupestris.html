                <h1>Acalypha rupestris</h1>
<p>Acalypha rupestris, commonly known as rock-rose or red-root, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from red to yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Acalypha rupestris is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha rupestris has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, and they vary in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a spreading or upright habit depending on the environment. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with yellow stamens and a pale green to white pistil, blooming from summer to fall, and they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed schizocarp that splits into three winged segments, dispersing seeds by wind, and the seeds are small, dry, and have a slight ridge.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha rupestris is a flowering plant native to the southern United States, particularly Texas and northeastern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of Central America and the Caribbean, where it has been introduced. This species thrives in dry, rocky, and disturbed environments such as cliffs, gravelly soils, and along roadsides. It typically grows at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to about 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Acalypha rupestris is currently considered of least concern by the IUCN, as it is relatively widespread and not facing significant threats.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha rupestris is a striking, fast-growing shrub known for its vibrant, colorful foliage and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable and rapid method. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to maintain shape and encourage bushiness are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or mealybugs in humid conditions, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like sedum or lavender can enhance its growth and create a visually appealing landscape.</p>
