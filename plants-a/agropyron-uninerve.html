<p>Agropyron uninerve, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and its ability to thrive in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Agropyron uninerve is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and soil-stabilizing properties.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in both agricultural and environmental contexts.</p>
