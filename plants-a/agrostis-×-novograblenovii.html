                    <h1>Agrostis × novograblenovii</h1>
<p>Agrostis × novograblenovii, commonly known as the hybrid meadowgrass, is a sterile, naturally occurring hybrid between Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis stolonifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and tufted growth habit, often found in moist, temperate environments. The plant typically forms dense mats and is adapted to a variety of soil types, including sandy and loamy soils. It is widely distributed across Europe and parts of Asia, often growing in meadows, pastures, and along waterways.</p>
<p>Due to its sterile nature, it does not produce viable seeds, relying on vegetative propagation for spread.</p>
