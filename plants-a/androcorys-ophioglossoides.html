                    <h1>Androcorys ophioglossoides</h1>
<p>Androcorys ophioglossoides, commonly known as the broad-leaved harts-tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the Appalachian region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a unique reproductive structure, with sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist forest floors and is often found in rich, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
