                <h1>Acrotrema bullatum</h1>
<p>Acrotrema bullatum, commonly known as the globular liverwort, is a small, leafy liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular growth habit, with dense clusters of leafy shoots forming a rounded structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its leaves are usually smooth and closely arranged, with a distinctive coloration that can range from green to reddish-brown.</p>
<p>Acrotrema bullatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotrema bullatum has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a slightly rough texture and a reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. It produces tiny, white flowers in clusters during the spring, featuring a simple structure with four petals, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotrema bullatum is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas with high humidity and warm climates. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its distribution is largely confined to the Atlantic Forest and the Pantanal wetlands.</p>
<p>Acrotrema bullatum is well adapted to the diverse ecosystems of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotrema bullatum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a species of lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. The introduction is likely due to human activities such as accidental transport on plants or equipment. It has been recorded in various regions across the country, including the North Island and some areas of the South Island.</p>
<p>Despite its introduction, it has not become invasive and is considered a minor component of the local lichen community.</p>
