                        <h1>Acaena pinnatifida var. parvifrons</h1>
<p>Acaena pinnatifida var. parvifrons, commonly known as the small-fruited nettle tree, is a shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and small, palmate leaves. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are clustered in heads, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often forming dense thickets.</p>
<p>Due to its prickly structure, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena pinnatifida var. parvifrons is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the South Island, particularly in the mountainous regions of Canterbury and Otago. This variety thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often growing in open vegetation or along streambanks. It is commonly associated with alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the cool, temperate climate of New Zealand's southern regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena pinnatifida var. parvifrons was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now widespread across much of the North Island and parts of the South Island.</p>
