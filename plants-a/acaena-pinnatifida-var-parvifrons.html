                        <h1>Acaena pinnatifida var. parvifrons</h1>
<p>Acaena pinnatifida var. parvifrons, commonly known as the small-fruited nettle tree, is a shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and small, palmate leaves. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are clustered in heads, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often forming dense thickets.</p>
<p>Due to its prickly structure, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
