                <h1>Acmispon neomexicanus</h1>
<p>Acmispon neomexicanus, commonly known as the New Mexico burro's tail, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and open plains.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmispon neomexicanus has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a pale green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat woody at the base, and has a rough, fissured bark that is usually brown to reddish-brown in color. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense racemes, blooming from April to June, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a slender legume pod that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, allowing the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients efficiently from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon neomexicanus is primarily native to Arizona, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Northwest, and New Mexico.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in rocky soils and open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. The species is well adapted to the dry climate and limited rainfall of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon neomexicanus was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States, particularly in New Mexico and Texas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils such as roadsides, fields, and along fence rows. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well-suited for the climate of its introduced range. It has been reported in several counties across New Mexico, including Socorro, Torrance, and Guadalupe.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in agricultural and natural areas within its distribution.</p>
