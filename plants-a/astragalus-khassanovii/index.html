                            <h1>Astragalus Khassanovii</h1>
<p>Astragalus khassanovii is a rare and elusive plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family and is known for its delicate, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. This species is highly specialized, often growing in rocky or arid environments where few other plants can survive. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts. Studying Astragalus khassanovii provides valuable insights into the adaptability of flora in extreme conditions.</p>
