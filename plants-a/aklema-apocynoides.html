<p>Aklema apocynoides, commonly known as the blue milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its milky sap, typical of the Apocynaceae family, is toxic and serves as a defense mechanism.</p>
<p>Aklema apocynoides is often found in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats.</p>
