<p>It features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves that are covered in fine pubescence, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with rocky or gravelly conditions.</p>
