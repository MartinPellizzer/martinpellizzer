                    <h1>Avena rupestris var. filiformis</h1>
<p>Avena rupestris var. filiformis, commonly known as the slender oat or filiform oat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky and arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on rocky outcrops. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky landscapes.</p>
