                <h1>Adromischus clavifolius</h1>
<p>Adromischus clavifolius, commonly known as the "Cape Mallow," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish or purplish tint, arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Adromischus clavifolius is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adromischus clavifolius has thick, fleshy leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged in a rosette pattern, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are a vibrant green with a bluish tinge, and they are covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively hidden beneath the rosette of leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems, and they are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that disperses its seeds by wind when it splits open.</p>

<p>It is commonly found in rocky, well-drained soils in coastal and mountainous areas. This succulent plant thrives in sunny environments and is often seen growing on rock faces or in rocky outcrops. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, with dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adromischus clavifolius was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it is commonly found in rocky outcrops and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is also cultivated in other parts of the world, including the United States and Europe, due to its ornamental value. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. It is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
