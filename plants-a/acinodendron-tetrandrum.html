                <h1>Acinodendron tetrandrum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron tetrandrum, commonly known as the four-threaded acacia, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant has a woody stem with thorny branches, typical of many Acacia species. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, flat pods that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and restricted habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron tetrandrum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring four stamens and a yellowish-green color, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's arid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron tetrandrum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and secondary growth areas. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. It is often associated with lowland and hill forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into parts of Indonesia and the Philippines as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron tetrandrum was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability to tropical climates.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivation and established itself in native ecosystems, particularly in disturbed areas and along coastal regions. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types have contributed to its successful establishment. However, its invasive potential remains a concern for local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, management efforts are underway to control its spread and mitigate ecological impacts.</p>
