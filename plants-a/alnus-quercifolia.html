                    <h1>Alnus quercifolia</h1>
<p>Alnus quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaved alder, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, serrated leaves that resemble those of oak trees, hence its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in catkins, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment.</p>
<p>Alnus quercifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland edges.</p>
