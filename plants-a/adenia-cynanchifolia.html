                <h1>Adenia cynanchifolia</h1>
<p>Adenia cynanchifolia, commonly known as the climbing adenium, is a woody vine native to eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive scent. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Adenia cynanchifolia is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia cynanchifolia has compound, pinnate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with leaflets that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are large, showy, and borne in clusters, featuring a yellowish-green calyx and red petals, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia cynanchifolia is primarily native to Cameroon, Congo, DR Congo, Gabon, Gulf of Guinea Is., and Nigeria.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical rainforest regions of these countries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the dense forest canopy. Adenia cynanchifolia is commonly encountered in the understory of primary and secondary forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the ecological conditions of the Central African rainforests.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia cynanchifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and urban areas where it thrives in well-drained soils. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native flora. Its spread is often facilitated by its ability to produce numerous seeds and establish quickly in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
