                <h1>Adenocalymma trifoliatum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaf bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma trifoliatum is known for its ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it an adaptation to its native environment.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma trifoliatum has trifoliate leaves that are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, which are ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and have a dark green color with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in umbels, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma trifoliatum is primarily native to Brazil Northeast, Brazil Southeast, and Brazil West-Central.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. The species is part of the Leguminosae family and is known for its distinctive trifoliate leaves.</p>
<p>Its native distribution highlights its ecological significance in the diverse ecosystems of Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma trifoliatum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant is known for its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has been cultivated for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
