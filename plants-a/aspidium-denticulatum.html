<p>Aspidium denticulatum, commonly known as the toothed water fern, is a member of the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often covered in small, tooth-like projections. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Aspidium denticulatum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
