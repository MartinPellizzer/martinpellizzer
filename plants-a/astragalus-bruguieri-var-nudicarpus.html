                    <h1>Astragalus bruguieri var. nudicarpus</h1>
<p>Astragalus bruguieri var. nudicarpus, commonly known as the nakedpod milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in raceme clusters, followed by pod-like fruits that remain dry and dehiscent. It has adapted to harsh environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
