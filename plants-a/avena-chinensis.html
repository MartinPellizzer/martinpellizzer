                    <h1>Avena chinensis</h1>
<p>Avena chinensis, commonly known as Chinese oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in ecological restoration.</p>
<p>Avena chinensis is often found in moist soils along riverbanks and in open woodlands.</p>
