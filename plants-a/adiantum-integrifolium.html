                <h1>Adiantum integrifolium</h1>
<p>Adiantum integrifolium, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically bright green and have a distinctive, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantum integrifolium is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in shady garden settings or as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum integrifolium has fern-like leaves that are triangular in shape, with a finely toothed margin and a bright green color, arranged in a bipinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in late spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a club-shaped sorus containing spores rather than seeds, and spore dispersal occurs through wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum integrifolium is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands, stream banks, and rocky areas. This fern thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with forest understories. Its distribution spans from the northeastern United States down to the southeastern regions.</p>
<p>It is also present in some parts of southern Ontario and Quebec.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum integrifolium was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. This fern is often cultivated in gardens due to its attractive, delicate fronds and ability to thrive in partial shade. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in these areas and is sometimes classified as an invasive plant in certain ecosystems.</p>
