<p>Adiantum integrifolium, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically bright green and have a distinctive, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantum integrifolium is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in shady garden settings or as a houseplant.</p>
