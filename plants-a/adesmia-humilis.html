                <h1>Adesmia humilis</h1>
<p>Adesmia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf adesmia, is a low-growing shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features small, compound leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Adesmia humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia humilis has small, ovate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, typically measuring around 1-2 centimeters in length, with a glossy green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a pale green to slightly woody bark that becomes more fibrous with age, and it grows in a branching pattern. The flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, featuring white to pale yellow petals and stamens, blooming during the spring and early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia humilis is primarily native to South America, specifically found in regions of Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly found in the dry grasslands and shrublands of the Pampas and Chaco biomes. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and has a low-growing, sprawling habit.</p>
<p>Adesmia humilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals and insects in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia humilis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, pastures, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in temperate climates, particularly in South America, where it has been widely naturalized. Its introduction has led to its spread into new regions, sometimes becoming invasive in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is now commonly found in various disturbed environments across its range.</p>
