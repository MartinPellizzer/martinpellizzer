                    <h1>Alcantarea geniculata</h1>
<p>Alcantarea geniculata, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, hibiscus-like flowers that come in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant features a woody stem with a distinctive zigzag pattern, which gives it its scientific name "geniculata," meaning "kinked" or "bent.". Its leaves are broad, palmate, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention in its native arid environment.</p>
<p>Alcantarea geniculata is cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil with full sun exposure.</p>
