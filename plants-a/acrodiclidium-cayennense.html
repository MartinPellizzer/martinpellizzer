                <h1>Acrodiclidium cayennense</h1>
<p>Acrodiclidium cayennense, commonly known as the Cayenne spurge, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a succulent plant native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically yellow or green, and are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts.</p>
<p>It contains toxic latex, which can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrodiclidium cayennense has simple, alternate leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a dark green color and a smooth surface, arranged along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrodiclidium cayennense is primarily native to the Amazon Basin, specifically in the region of French Guiana.</p>
<p>It is found in the humid tropical rainforests where it thrives in the warm and moist climate. This plant is commonly associated with swampy and lowland areas, often growing near rivers and in flooded habitats. Its distribution is limited to the northeastern part of South America, particularly in the Guiana Shield.</p>
<p>It plays a minor role in the local ecosystem but is an important indicator of wetland environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrodiclidium cayennense was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high rainfall and well-drained soils, often near streams or in dense vegetation. This plant has been reported in parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines, where it has established itself in natural and disturbed habitats. Its introduction may be linked to human activities such as horticulture or accidental transport through trade.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains largely unstudied.</p>
