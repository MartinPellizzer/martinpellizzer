                    <h1>Alnus integrifolia</h1>
<p>Alnus integrifolia, commonly known as the Sitka alder, is a deciduous tree native to the coastal regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Alnus integrifolia is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria, enriching the soil.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forested areas.</p>
