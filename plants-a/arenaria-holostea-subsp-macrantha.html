<p>Arenaria holostea subsp.</p>
<p>macrantha, commonly known as the pink sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of succulent, prostrate stems covered in small, rounded leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler climates.</p>
