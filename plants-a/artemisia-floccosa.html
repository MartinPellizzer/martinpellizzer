                    <h1>Artemisia floccosa</h1>
<p>Artemisia floccosa, commonly known as silky wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a soft, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
<p>Its aromatic properties and historical use in traditional medicine also contribute to its ecological and cultural significance.</p>
