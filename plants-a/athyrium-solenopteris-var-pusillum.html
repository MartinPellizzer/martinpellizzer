                    <h1>Athyrium solenopteris var. pusillum</h1>
<p>Athyrium solenopteris var. pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf lady fern, is a variant of the lady fern family (Dryopteridaceae).</p>
<p>It is a small, delicate fern characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are borne on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid, shaded habitats.</p>
