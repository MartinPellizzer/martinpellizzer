                <h1>Acronychia wabagensis</h1>
<p>Acronychia wabagensis, commonly known as the Wabagen acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Meliaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Australia, particularly in Queensland. The plant is a small to medium-sized tree, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a distinctive serrated margin.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and usually yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in panicles, and are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia wabagensis has compound leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its small, yellowish-white flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animal ingestion and droppings.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in nutrient-poor soils and facilitating water absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia wabagensis is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in the northeastern regions. It thrives in humid and shaded environments within primary and secondary forest habitats. The plant is commonly observed in areas with well-drained soils and high rainfall.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within New Guinea.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia wabagensis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests. The plant thrives in humid and warm climates with well-drained soil. It is often used for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>However, it has become invasive in some regions, posing a threat to native ecosystems.</p>
