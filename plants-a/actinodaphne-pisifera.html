<p>Actinodaphne pisifera, commonly known as the broadleaf laurel, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes many aromatic and economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a fragrant aroma, and it produces drupes that are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and its potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne pisifera has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a smooth upper surface and a slightly hairy lower surface, measuring approximately 5–10 cm in length and 2–4 cm in width, and typically have a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from April to June, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round drupe that turns from green to yellow or red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in water absorption and anchoring the plant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne pisifera is primarily native to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in the wetter regions. This plant thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing along riverbanks and in secondary forests. It is an important component of the local flora and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the natural habitats of Sri Lanka.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne pisifera was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in shaded to semi-shaded environments. The plant is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses due to its attractive foliage and ability to adapt to various soil types.
