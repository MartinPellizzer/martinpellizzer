                <h1>Adonis hirsuta</h1>
<p>Adonis hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy adonis, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Adonis hirsuta is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of mountainous ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis hirsuta has basal leaves that are basal, spoon-shaped (spatulate), and hairy, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slightly hairy, and has a pale green color, growing in a clump-like pattern. The flowers are yellow, with a single pistil and numerous stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis hirsuta is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. This species is commonly found in rocky or alpine meadows where the climate is cool and the soil is well-drained. It is adapted to harsh conditions and plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic areas, making it a regionally important plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis hirsuta was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered invasive in several regions, particularly in the western United States. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns. It is commonly found in open habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it a challenging species to manage in natural areas.</p>
