                    <h1>Achillea × serrata</h1>
<p>Achillea × serrata, commonly known as the hybrid yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its feathery, finely divided leaves and flat-topped clusters of small, often white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its hybrid nature results from crosses between Achillea millefolium and Achillea ptarmica.</p>
