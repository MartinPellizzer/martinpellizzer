                <h1>Achillea × serrata</h1>
<p>Achillea × serrata, commonly known as the serrated yarrow, is a hybrid perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely dissected, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, often pale yellow to white flower heads. The plant typically grows in full sun to partial shade and thrives in well-drained soils. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × serrata has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, gray-green in color, and arranged in a rosette pattern, with a rough texture due to fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, somewhat hairy, and have a light green color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of ray florets in white or pale yellow, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene, dispersed by wind due to its lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × serrata is a hybrid perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends into parts of the Middle East and southern Europe, often found in cultivated gardens and naturalized areas. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, or gravelly soils and is commonly found in open habitats such as meadows, slopes, and rocky outcrops. It typically grows at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and potential threats from habitat loss, Achillea × serrata is considered to be of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea × serrata is a hardy perennial plant known for its fragrant, yellow to orange flowers and feathery foliage, often used in ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, division, or stem cuttings, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, loamy soil, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilize it lightly in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune spent flowers to encourage continuous blooming and maintain shape.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered, and it pairs well with lavender, coneflowers, and other drought-tolerant plants in garden designs.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea × serrata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both nectar and shelter in its dense foliage. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea × serrata contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health through its natural growth habits.</p>
