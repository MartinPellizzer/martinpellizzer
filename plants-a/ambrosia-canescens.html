                    <h1>Ambrosia canescens</h1>
<p>Ambrosia canescens, commonly known as whiteleaf ambrosia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Ambrosia canescens is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal.</p>
