<p>Anosporum paraguayense, commonly known as the Paraguay spleenwort, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae).</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees in humid, tropical environments. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are often clustered together, and it produces spores rather than seeds. It is native to South America, particularly Paraguay and Brazil, and thrives in shaded, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
