<p>Asplenium aemilii-guineae, commonly known as the Guinean spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered closely together. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its rhizomes are short and help anchor it to its substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in humid, shaded environments.</p>
