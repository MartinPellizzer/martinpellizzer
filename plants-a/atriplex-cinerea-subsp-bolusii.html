<p>Atriplex cinerea subsp.</p>
<p>bolusii, commonly known as silverleaf shadscale, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important component of xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
