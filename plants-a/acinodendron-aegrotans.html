                <h1>Acinodendron aegrotans</h1>
<p>Acinodendron aegrotans, commonly known as the fever tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers followed by red, fleshy berries. It is often found in moist, lowland areas and is known for its ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>The fever tree is also notable for its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron aegrotans has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, bark that is grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in terminal panicles, and bloom during the dry season, likely pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soil in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron aegrotans is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest regions, often growing in shaded understory conditions. This plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is typically associated with tropical and subtropical climates. It is often seen in primary and secondary forests, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its distribution has become increasingly fragmented in recent years.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron aegrotans was mainly introduced to disturbed habitats such as roadsides, waste areas, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It is often found in regions with poor soil quality and high light exposure. The plant has shown adaptability to various environmental conditions, allowing it to spread rapidly in new areas. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its competitive growth habits.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native vegetation and ecosystem balance.</p>
