                <h1>Acrozus punctatus</h1>
<p>Acrozus punctatus, commonly known as the speckled acrozus, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive leaf patterns.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a waxy surface and feature small, dark spots that give it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrozus punctatus has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with ovate leaflets that are dark green on top and pale underneath, measuring approximately 2-4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers with four petals, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrozus punctatus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and montane forest areas. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich organic soil. It is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within the archipelago.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrozus punctatus was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as trade and horticultural practices.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides, abandoned fields, and urban environments. The plant has adapted well to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction contribute to its invasive potential in non-native regions.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems is still being studied due to its relatively recent introduction.</p>
