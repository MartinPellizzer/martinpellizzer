                <h1>Adelaster albovenosus</h1>
<p>Adelaster albovenosus, commonly known as the white-flowered star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant belonging to the Primulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its star-shaped, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. It has opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy surface and produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Adelaster albovenosus is native to regions in Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelaster albovenosus has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a bluish-green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbel-like inflorescences, featuring five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to poor soils and aiding in the plant's survival in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelaster albovenosus is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. This plant typically grows in rocky soils and can be found in desert or semi-desert environments. It thrives in areas with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within these geographic ranges.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelaster albovenosus was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive white flowers.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond its initial cultivation areas, establishing itself in various disturbed habitats. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils have contributed to its successful invasion. It is now considered a potential weed in some parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native ornamental plants.</p>
