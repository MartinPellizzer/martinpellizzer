                    <h1>Allocarya oligochaeta</h1>
<p>Allocarya oligochaeta, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, often hairy stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is adapted to retain moisture in dry soils, making it resilient to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Allocarya oligochaeta plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
