The plant features dense clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are succulent and adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
