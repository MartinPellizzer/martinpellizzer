<p>Acomis bella, commonly known as the pink riceflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Acomis bella is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acomis bella has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and typically range from 10 to 20 cm in length with a bluish-gray hue.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green surface, and it grows in a clump-forming pattern. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds through wind, with each seed having a fine, hairy appendage.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomis bella is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States, primarily found in the southeastern region, including states like Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>Its current distribution has expanded slightly due to human activity, though it remains largely confined to its original range. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and hammocks, often growing along stream banks or in wetlands. Acomis bella is typically found at low to moderate altitudes, usually below 300 meters.</p>
<p>It is listed as a species of concern in some states due to habitat loss and is considered endangered in Florida, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acomis bella is a delicate, flowering plant native to the southeastern United States, known for its charming, bell-shaped blooms.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or division, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period to germinate successfully. The plant has a short growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and going dormant in the fall.</p>
