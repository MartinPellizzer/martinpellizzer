<p>Atriplex pterocarpa, commonly known as the silverleaf chenopod, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves, which are covered in fine, reflective hairs that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are encased in small, beak-like fruits. Atriplex pterocarpa is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
