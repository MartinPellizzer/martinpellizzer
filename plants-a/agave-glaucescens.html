                    <h1>Agave glaucescens</h1>
<p>Agave glaucescens, commonly known as the blue agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, blue-gray leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces a tall, flowering stalk that bears small, greenish-white flowers, which are followed by pale blue berries. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The plant's rosette structure and striking foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
