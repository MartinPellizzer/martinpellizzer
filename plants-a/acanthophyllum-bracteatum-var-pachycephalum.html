                    <h1>Acanthophyllum bracteatum var. pachycephalum</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum bracteatum var. pachycephalum, commonly known as the thick-headed jointvetch, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, woody structure and dense, spiny foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its thick, fleshy stems and leaves are adapted to store water, making it well-suited for survival in drought conditions.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
