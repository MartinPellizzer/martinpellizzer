                <h1>Acinodendron gilvum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron gilvum, commonly known as the golden acacia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system has nitrogen-fixing capabilities, making it beneficial for soil enrichment.</p>
<p>The bark and leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron gilvum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5â€“8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a pale brown bark that becomes rough with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron gilvum is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the lowland and hill forest regions where the climate is warm and humid. This species thrives in shaded undergrowth, often growing along riverbanks and in secondary forest areas. It is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron gilvum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and well-drained soil conditions. The plant has been reported in several countries in Africa, particularly in eastern and southern regions. Its introduction is often associated with human activities that alter natural landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
