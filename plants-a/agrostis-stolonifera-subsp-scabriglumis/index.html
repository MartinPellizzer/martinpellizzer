                            <h1>Agrostis Stolonifera Subsp. Scabriglumis</h1>
<p>Common bentgrass, scientifically known as Agrostis stolonifera subsp. scabriglumis, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, dark green blades that make it a popular choice for ornamental and turfgrass applications. This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, golf courses, and along stream banks. Its ability to form a thick sod makes it resilient to foot traffic and environmental stress. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
