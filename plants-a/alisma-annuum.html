<p>Alisma annuum, commonly known as marsh arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments across North America.</p>
<p>It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapting to aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively.</p>
<p>Alisma annuum plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
