<p>Aspidium pica, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Aspidium pica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
