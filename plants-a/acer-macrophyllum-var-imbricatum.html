                <h1>Acer macrophyllum var. imbricatum</h1>
<p>Acer macrophyllum var. imbricatum, commonly known as the Oregon maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically a vibrant green in summer and turn yellow or orange in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with a temperate climate.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum var. imbricatum has large, palmately lobed leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a deciduous tree with a spreading crown. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum var. imbricatum is a variant of the Pacific madrone, native to the western coast of North America, primarily found in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to specific coastal and mountainous regions in these states. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils in mixed evergreen forests and along stream banks. It typically grows at elevations between 300 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, it is considered a species of concern in some areas, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum var. imbricatum is a striking evergreen shrub known for its large, glossy leaves and vibrant red bark, commonly used in ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through softwood cuttings taken in late spring or hardwood cuttings in late winter, ensuring successful root development. This plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, thriving in USDA hardiness zones 6-9, and requires well-drained soil with partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Regular watering is necessary during the growing season, but it should be reduced in winter to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning should focus on shaping and removing dead or diseased branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract scale insects or aphids, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or heathers can enhance its aesthetic appeal and create a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum var. imbricatum is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in native landscapes, enhancing the health of surrounding vegetation. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in improving soil structure and moisture retention in its ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum var. imbricatum is a species of maple known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
