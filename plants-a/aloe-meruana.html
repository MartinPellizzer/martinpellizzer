The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear yellow flowers during the warmer months. Aloe meruana is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive drought conditions.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance.</p>
