                    <h1>Agrostis tenuissima</h1>
<p>Agrostis tenuissima, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is often found in moist, well-drained soils, such as those in lawns, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 millimeter in width, giving it a delicate appearance. Its small, spikelet-based inflorescences contain both male and female flowers, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Agrostis tenuissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
