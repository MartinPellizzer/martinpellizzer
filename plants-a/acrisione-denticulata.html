                <h1>Acrisione denticulata</h1>
<p>Acrisione denticulata, commonly known as the toothed acrisione, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, toothed leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe and parts of western Asia, it thrives in grassy areas and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is sometimes grown in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrisione denticulata has simple, alternate leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with serrated margins and a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale yellow, featuring five petals and numerous stamens, and bloom in early spring, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrisione denticulata is primarily native to Argentina South, Chile Central, and Chile South.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the temperate regions of these areas. It thrives in grasslands and open habitats with well-drained soils. Acrisione denticulata is adapted to the climate conditions of South America's southern regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the natural vegetation patterns of these geographic areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrisione denticulata was mainly introduced to control weeds in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>It is commonly used as a cover crop to prevent soil erosion and improve soil structure. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is particularly effective in areas with poor soil conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it a popular choice for land stabilization.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive if not managed properly, posing a risk to native plant communities.</p>
