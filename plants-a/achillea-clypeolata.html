                <h1>Achillea clypeolata</h1>
<p>Achillea clypeolata, commonly known as the shield flower, is a perennial herb native to central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, disk-like flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with finely divided, gray-green foliage. Its flowers are yellow to orange in color, appearing in summer, and it is often found in meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>Achillea clypeolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea clypeolata has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, with a silver-gray underside and a dark green upper surface, arranged in a rosette formation and ranging in size from 5 to 15 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark, and grows from the base of the plant in a single, unbranched pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disc flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea clypeolata is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in countries such as Spain, Italy, and Greece.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across the Mediterranean Basin, including parts of North Africa and the Middle East. This species thrives in dry, rocky, and sunny environments, often found on slopes and in open woodlands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea clypeolata is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea clypeolata is a hardy perennial known for its fern-like foliage and showy yellow flowers, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer, ensuring robust growth and genetic diversity. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, requiring moderate watering to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage rebloom.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions, and it pairs well with lavender, echinacea, and other drought-tolerant plants for companion planting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea clypeolata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, which contribute to ecosystem balance. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of neighboring species by improving soil conditions. It also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers shelter and habitat for small organisms, enhancing biodiversity in its environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea clypeolata is a lesser-known member of the sunflower family, primarily valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens due to its attractive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, some traditional uses may involve its leaves or flowers in local herbal teas. In medicinal contexts, it may have potential due to its reported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, though scientific validation is limited. Industrially, it has minimal economic significance compared to more common plants in the same genus.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic value in certain regions, though its symbolic meanings are not as well-documented as those of other achillea species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea clypeolata has several popular cultivars, including 'Aurea' and 'Purpurea', which are prized for their vibrant foliage and flowers.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly hybridized, some horticulturalists have created crosses with other achillea species to enhance traits like flower color and hardiness. These cultivars are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of garden conditions. Their horticultural importance lies in their use as decorative plants in rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea clypeolata remains a valuable addition to the garden due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
