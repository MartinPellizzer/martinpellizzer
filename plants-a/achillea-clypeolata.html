                <h1>Achillea clypeolata</h1>
<p>Achillea clypeolata, commonly known as the flathead yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of finely divided, gray-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to white composite flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its common name is derived from its distinctive flat, disk-like flower heads.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea clypeolata has basal, linear to lanceolate leaves that are arranged in a rosette, with a grayish-green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, herbaceous, and has a smooth, light green bark, growing in a single, branching pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets and brown disk florets, blooming in late summer to early fall, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene), which is dispersed by wind due to its feathery pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea clypeolata is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly found in countries such as France, Spain, and Portugal.</p>
<p>It is now also distributed in parts of North Africa and the Middle East due to human introduction. This species thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and coastal areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, Achillea clypeolata is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, though local populations may face threats from habitat loss and overgrazing.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea clypeolata is a hardy perennial known for its showy, flat-topped flowers and fragrant foliage, thriving in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer, though division is more reliable for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. This plant has a long growth cycle, blooming from early summer to late summer, with a dormant period in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging, and benefits from a light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring. Regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases, though it may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its fragrance and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea clypeolata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both nectar and habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its beneficial properties. It also contributes to erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea clypeolata offers ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea clypeolata is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value in gardens due to its attractive yellow flowers and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, some traditional practices may involve its use in herbal teas or infusions. In medicinal contexts, it has been studied for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, though more research is needed to confirm its efficacy. Industrially, it may contribute to ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in marginal soils.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions, often associated with healing and protection.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea clypeolata has several varieties and cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Caucasica' and 'Purpurea', which are known for their striking purple or pink flower heads and compact growth habit. While there are no widely recognized hybrids specifically bred for Achillea clypeolata, it is often crossed with other Achillea species to create new cultivars with enhanced traits. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions and its long-lasting blooms, making it a valuable addition to gardens.</p>
<p>This plant is also appreciated for its ability to attract pollinators and its low maintenance requirements.</p>
