                    <h1>Asplenium triphyllum var. majus</h1>
<p>Asplenium triphyllum var. majus, commonly known as the giant resurrection fern, is a unique fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that curl into a compact ball when dry and unroll when moist, a trait that aids in its survival during dry periods. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes form dense mats, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>The fern's ability to survive desiccation makes it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
