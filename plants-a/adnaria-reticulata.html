                <h1>Adnaria reticulata</h1>
<p>Adnaria reticulata, commonly known as the nettle tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and serrated leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its roots and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Adnaria reticulata is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species in various environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria reticulata has leaves that are simple, ovate, and slightly hairy, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, bark-like texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria reticulata is primarily native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean Sea, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, sandy or rocky substrates along the shorelines. This plant is commonly found in areas with moderate salinity and warm climates. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for small marine organisms.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the specific environmental conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria reticulata was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and estuaries, where it thrives in brackish water conditions. This plant has become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation for resources. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative propagation contribute to its success in invaded habitats.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
