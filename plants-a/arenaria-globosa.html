<p>Arenaria globosa, commonly known as the globular sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are usually succulent and fleshy, helping it retain moisture in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Arenaria globosa plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas.</p>
