                    <h1>Arthrostylidium purpuratum</h1>
<p>Arthrostylidium purpuratum, commonly known as the purple-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to parts of Australia.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that allow it to attach to and draw nutrients from its host tree. The plant typically grows as a shrub with small, opposite leaves and produces small, clustered white or pink flowers. Its berries are usually red or purple and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the health of its host plants.</p>
