                    <h1>Arenaria cucubaloides var. viscida</h1>
<p>Arenaria cucubaloides var. viscida, commonly known as sticky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pink. The plant produces sticky secretions on its stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptations to drought and its role in stabilizing soils in its native range.</p>
