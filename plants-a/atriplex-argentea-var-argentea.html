                    <h1>Atriplex argentea var. argentea</h1>
<p>Atriplex argentea var. argentea, commonly known as silver leaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, contributing to its ecological importance in desert ecosystems.</p>
