                    <h1>Angraecopsis confusa</h1>
<p>Angraecopsis confusa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale green, leaf-like structures that resemble foliage rather than typical orchid leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often appearing in late winter or early spring. Angraecopsis confusa thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a humid, shaded environment.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
