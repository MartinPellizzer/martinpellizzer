<p>Aspidium lomatopelta, commonly known as the veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs, which aid in anchoring and nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
