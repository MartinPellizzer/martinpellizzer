<p>Acalypha multicaulis, commonly known as the red-hot catshrub, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red bracts that surround small yellow flowers, giving it its common name. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture and prominent veins. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially sunny environments.</p>
<p>Acalypha multicaulis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha multicaulis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a glossy green color on the upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, often branching, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its small, clustered flowers are unisexual, with yellowish-green petals, and bloom during the summer months, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha multicaulis is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar, where it occurs in specific habitats.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely restricted to its native range, though it may be found in some botanical gardens or collections outside Madagascar. It thrives in tropical rainforests, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Acalypha multicaulis is typically found at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
