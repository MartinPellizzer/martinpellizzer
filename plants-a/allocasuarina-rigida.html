                    <h1>Allocasuarina rigida</h1>
<p>Allocasuarina rigida, commonly known as the rigid she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, needle-like leaves that are clustered in cylindrical structures called phyllodes, which are adapted for water conservation in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Allocasuarina rigida is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological importance in providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
