                <h1>Acer shangszeense var. anfuense</h1>
<p>Acer shangszeense var. anfuense, commonly known as the Anfu maple, is a rare variant of the Shangze maple native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often developing fissures with age.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer shangszeense var. anfuense has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that develops shallow furrows as the plant matures. It produces small, yellow-green flowers in clusters during the spring, with a simple structure consisting of four petals, and it is wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer shangszeense var. anfuense is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of western China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to specific areas within these provinces, where it grows in isolated populations. This plant thrives in temperate environments with high humidity and well-drained soils, typically found in forest understories. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Acer shangszeense var. anfuense is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer shangszeense var. anfuense is a rare and ornamental maple species that thrives in temperate climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The growth cycle includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and regular pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigolds can help repel pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer shangszeense var. anfuense is a unique plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. This plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other flora in its surrounding environment. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity and ecological balance of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer shangszeense var. anfuense is a lesser-known plant species with limited documented uses, primarily found in specific regions of China.</p>
<p>While it may not have widespread culinary applications, it could potentially be explored for local food uses in traditional diets. Its medicinal properties remain largely unstudied, though it may hold potential for traditional herbal remedies. In terms of industrial and economic value, it is not widely utilized, though its ornamental qualities might contribute to horticultural interests.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in local communities, though this requires further research and documentation.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer shangszeense var. anfuense has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Anfuense' and 'Dawn Red Maple,' which are known for their striking autumn foliage and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>It has also been used in hybridization efforts to create new maple varieties with enhanced traits such as improved cold hardiness and unique leaf colors. These hybrids often combine the ornamental features of A. shangszeense with the hardiness of other maple species, making them valuable in horticultural breeding programs. The plant's unique foliage and adaptability contribute to its horticultural importance in both landscape design and botanical gardens.</p>
<p>Its cultivation and study continue to play a role in the development of new maple cultivars for diverse climates.</p>
