                    <h1>Angraecum ramulicola</h1>
<p>Angraecum ramulicola, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the eastern rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose substrates to prevent root rot. Its flowers open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths, which is a unique adaptation to its ecological niche.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Angraecum ramulicola is considered endangered and is protected in its native region.</p>
