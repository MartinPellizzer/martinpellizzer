                <h1>Adina griffithii</h1>
<p>Adina griffithii, commonly known as the Indian rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, red berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and wood quality, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional crafts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina griffithii has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a bushy pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in dry, rocky environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina griffithii is primarily native to the eastern Himalayas, including regions in India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest environments at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed sites within its native range.</p>
<p>Adina griffithii is a shrub or small tree that plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina griffithii was mainly introduced to specific regions in Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland, as part of ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, open woodlands, and along creeklines. The plant has established itself in these areas due to its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to environmental stress. However, it is not considered invasive in these regions and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its introduction has primarily been through human activity rather than natural dispersal.</p>
