                <h1>Adina griffithii</h1>
<p>Adina griffithii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the southern parts of India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round berries containing dark brown seeds. Adina griffithii is valued for its hard, dark wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and decorative items.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina griffithii has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length. The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in the summer months and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina griffithii is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries such as India, Bangladesh, and Myanmar.</p>
<p>While its native range is well-documented, its current distribution is less clear, with limited records suggesting it may be rare or even locally extinct in some areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically within tropical rainforests or undergrowth. Adina griffithii is usually found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is uncertain, though it is likely threatened by deforestation and environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adina griffithii is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia, known for its fragrant leaves and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seed, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining the plant's genetic traits. The growth cycle of Adina griffithii is relatively slow, with new growth appearing in spring and flowering occurring in late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourages bushier growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like mint or rosemary can help repel pests and enhance the plant's growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adina griffithii is a small shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, improving soil fertility and supporting the growth of other plants in its vicinity. Its dense growth also helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, Adina griffithii contributes to biodiversity by offering habitat and resources to a range of ecological organisms.</p>
