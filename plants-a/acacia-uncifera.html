                    <h1>Acacia uncifera</h1>
<p>Acacia uncifera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, spherical clusters, which attract a variety of pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Acacia uncifera is well-suited to dry climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature.</p>
