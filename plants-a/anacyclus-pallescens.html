                    <h1>Anacyclus pallescens</h1>
<p>Anacyclus pallescens, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small annual herb with a basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits that are dispersed by wind. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Anacyclus pallescens is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
