                    <h1>Acrotrema uniflorum var. rotundatum</h1>
<p>Acrotrema uniflorum var. rotundatum, commonly known as the rounded acrotrema, is a rare and specialized liverwort species found in specific, often moist and shaded habitats.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its compact, thalloid structure with a distinctive, rounded growth form. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a dorsiventral thallus and a well-developed central strand, typical of many hepatic species. Its reproductive structures, including leafy shoots and sporophytes, are adapted for dispersal in humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered an important indicator species for undisturbed microhabitats.</p>
