                <h1>Aconitum komatsui</h1>
<p>Aconitum komatsui, commonly known as Japanese aconite, is a perennial herb native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, typically arranged in a spicate inflorescence. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed foliage that is often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Aconitum komatsui is known for its toxic alkaloids, making it a plant that requires caution when handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum komatsui has leaves that are palmately compound, with 5-7 leaflets that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, dark green in color, and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and cylindrical, with a dark green to reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are large, showy, and borne in racemes, with a blue to violet hue, and they bloom in summer, relying on insect pollination, primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are small, flat, and dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storage and anchoring the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum komatsui is primarily native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, specifically Japan, Korea, and China.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forested areas and rocky slopes at high altitudes. This species thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. It is often associated with temperate climates and is part of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum komatsui was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue to purple flowers and attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in gardens and naturalized in some regions, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. Despite its beauty, it is highly toxic and can pose a danger to humans and livestock if ingested. The plant's introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to spread beyond cultivated areas.</p>
<p>It is important to manage its growth carefully to prevent it from becoming invasive in local ecosystems.</p>
