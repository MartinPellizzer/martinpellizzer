                <h1>Adenodaphne spathulata</h1>
<p>Adenodaphne spathulata, commonly known as the broadleaf senna, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth surface and a fragrant aroma when crushed.</p>
<p>Adenodaphne spathulata is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical and subtropical forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenodaphne spathulata has elliptical to ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that remains relatively unchanging throughout the plant's life. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in umbels, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that splits open to release black seeds, which are dispersed by birds consuming the fleshy pulp.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodaphne spathulata is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is currently found only in the eastern part of the island, particularly in the northeastern region. This species thrives in moist, shaded forest environments, often growing in the understory of primary rainforests. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Adenodaphne spathulata is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenodaphne spathulata is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to tropical regions, known for its attractive foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seed, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. The plant has a moderate growth cycle, thriving in warm climates and requiring minimal pruning to maintain its shape.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season helps promote healthy growth, while common pests like scale insects and diseases such as root rot can be managed with proper care and maintenance.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants can enhance its growth and create a lush, vibrant garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adenodaphne spathulata is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in tropical ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity and stability of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Adenodaphne spathulata is a plant with limited documented uses, primarily found in its native habitats in Southeast Asia.</p>
