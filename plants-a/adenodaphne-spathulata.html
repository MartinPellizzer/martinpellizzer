                <h1>Adenodaphne spathulata</h1>
<p>Adenodaphne spathulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf daphne, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and usually have a lanceolate or ovate shape.</p>
<p>The fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and the plant is often found in moist, tropical forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenodaphne spathulata has leaves that are spatulate in shape, with a broad base and tapering tip, arranged alternately along the stem, and measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodaphne spathulata is primarily native to the western Pacific region, including parts of Southeast Asia and northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in moist lowland forests. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, often growing near rivers or in coastal regions. Its natural range extends across countries such as Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Adenodaphne spathulata is typically associated with secondary growth habitats and is often encountered in understory layers of dense vegetation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodaphne spathulata was mainly introduced to coastal and lowland areas in Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil, making it common in mangrove forests and disturbed coastal habitats. The plant is often found growing along riverbanks and tidal zones, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to manage its spread and protect endemic plant communities.</p>
