                <h1>Aconogonon limosum</h1>
<p>Aconogonon limosum, commonly known as the swamp morning glory, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial with heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in the early morning. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconogonon limosum has leaves that are alternate, simple, and ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 3–5 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, and they are arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern. The stem is slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconogonon limosum is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in regions with sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal areas and fynbos vegetation. This plant thrives in Mediterranean climates characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It is commonly seen in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa.</p>
<p>Aconogonon limosum is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate mild frost.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconogonon limosum was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, grass-like appearance.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread throughout the country, particularly in coastal and lowland areas. The plant is considered invasive in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species. It thrives in disturbed soils and can form dense stands that alter local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is now monitored and managed in several parts of New Zealand.</p>
