                <h1>Achillea cunoraea</h1>
<p>Achillea cunoraea, commonly known as lesser yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has feathery, aromatic leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Achillea cunoraea is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea cunoraea has compound, serrated leaves that are basal and arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-gray color and a woolly texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, herbaceous, and has a smooth, greenish-gray bark, growing in a compact, bushy pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a cylindrical achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in dry, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea cunoraea is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in countries such as Italy, France, and Switzerland.</p>
<p>It is currently found in similar alpine and subalpine habitats across parts of Europe, though its distribution has become more restricted due to habitat loss. This species thrives in dry, open environments with well-drained soils, often growing on rocky slopes or in meadows. It typically occurs at altitudes between 1,200 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>The conservation status of Achillea cunoraea is of concern, as it is considered threatened due to habitat degradation and limited population size.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea cunoraea is a hardy perennial plant known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in the fall. This plant has a dormant growth cycle, going through active growth in spring and summer, followed by a period of rest in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune back spent flowers to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or lavender can enhance its growth and attract beneficial pollinators.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea cunoraea is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering food sources and habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting other species. Its dense growth also helps with erosion control by stabilizing soil in open areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the ecological balance by promoting soil health and supporting a diverse range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea cunoraea is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, known for its ornamental value in gardens due to its bright yellow flowers.</p>
