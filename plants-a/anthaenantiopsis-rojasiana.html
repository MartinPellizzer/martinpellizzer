<p>Anthaenantiopsis rojasiana, commonly known as the Rosy Ghost Orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghostly white petals and sepals that resemble a spectral appearance, giving it its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in high humidity and shade, typically found in the understory of dense tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
