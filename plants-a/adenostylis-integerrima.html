                <h1>Adenostylis integerrima</h1>
<p>Adenostylis integerrima, commonly known as the Pacific coast grass or sea grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds.</p>
<p>Adenostylis integerrima plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostylis integerrima has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>Its stem is upright, cylindrical, and has a rough, fibrous bark that is typically brown in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, with a simple structure, blooming during the spring and summer months, and is primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that disperses its seeds through wind, as the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostylis integerrima is primarily native to coastal areas of southern California and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline. This plant thrives in dune environments and is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the coastal zone. It is often seen growing in association with other coastal flora such as beach strawberry and sand verbena.</p>
<p>Adenostylis integerrima plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostylis integerrima was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as a horticultural plant due to its ornamental value. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It is commonly found in coastal and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems.</p>
