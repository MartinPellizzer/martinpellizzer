<p>Adenostylis integerrima, commonly known as the Pacific coast grass or sea grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds.</p>
<p>Adenostylis integerrima plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
