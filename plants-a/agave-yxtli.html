                    <h1>Agave yxtli</h1>
<p>Agave yxtli, commonly known as the Mexican hat agave, is a succulent plant native to the dry regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a thick, spiky rosette of blue-gray leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with yellow flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber.</p>
<p>Agave yxtli is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates.</p>
