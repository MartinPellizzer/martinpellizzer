                    <h1>Acidanthera roseoalba</h1>
<p>Acidanthera roseoalba, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, coastal habitats. The plant features a slender, often branched stem and produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers with a unique, ghost-like appearance. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
