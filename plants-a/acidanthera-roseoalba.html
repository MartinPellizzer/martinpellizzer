                <h1>Acidanthera roseoalba</h1>
<p>Acidanthera roseoalba, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, coastal habitats. The plant features a slender, often branched stem and produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers with a unique, ghost-like appearance. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidanthera roseoalba has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a pale green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, white to pinkish in color, with three petals and three sepals, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidanthera roseoalba is primarily native to South Africa, specifically the Eastern Cape Province.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grassland and rocky habitats within this region. This plant thrives in areas with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. It is often associated with coastal and mountainous environments.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to specific areas within South Africa, where it grows as a perennial herb.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidanthera roseoalba was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, pale pink flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in certain areas, particularly in the North Island. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and poses minimal risk to native ecosystems.</p>
