                <h1>Achillea pinnata</h1>
<p>Achillea pinnata, commonly known as yarrow, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads and feathery leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“90 cm and thrives in well-drained soil in full sun. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink and red, bloom from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>Achillea pinnata is often used in traditional medicine and as a garden ornamental due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pinnata has leaves that are pinnately compound, with slender, serrated leaflets that are green on top and slightly grayish underneath.</p>
<p>The stems are hairy, erect, and have a reddish-brown color, growing in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-white composite blooms arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and anchor itself in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pinnata is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and coastal areas, often found along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. This plant is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is commonly found in coastal scrub and maquis vegetation. It is also known to occur in the Canary Islands and parts of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the climate and soil conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pinnata was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fern-like foliage and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the western United States. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in meadows, and in dry, open habitats. Its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation in some areas.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, Achillea pinnata is considered an invasive species in certain parts of its range.</p>
