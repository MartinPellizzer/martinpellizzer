                        <h1>Acanthophippium lycaste</h1>
<p>Acanthophippium lycaste, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the summer months. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is well-suited to harsh, drought-prone environments.</p>
<p>Acanthophippium lycaste is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-water landscapes.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthophippium lycaste is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and limestone soils, often in coastal areas and mountainous regions. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments and is adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat. It is particularly common in countries such as Spain, Italy, and Morocco.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthophippium lycaste was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in several states, particularly in the southwestern region, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. This plant is considered invasive in some areas because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor and control its spread to prevent further ecological disruption.</p>
