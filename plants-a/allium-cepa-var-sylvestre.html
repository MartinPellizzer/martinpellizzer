<p>Allium cepa var. sylvestre, commonly known as wild leek, is a perennial plant native to the forests of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, grass-like leaves and small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces a bulbous structure similar to garlic and onions, which is used in culinary applications. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
