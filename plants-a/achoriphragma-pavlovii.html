                <h1>Achoriphragma pavlovii</h1>
<p>Achoriphragma pavlovii, commonly known as the Pavlov's sandmat, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments. It has a limited distribution and is often found in sandy or rocky soils, where it survives with minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma pavlovii has leaves that are simple, ovate, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unbranched. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma pavlovii is primarily native to the semi-arid regions of southern Africa, specifically Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils within these areas. The plant thrives in environments with low rainfall and high solar exposure. It is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma pavlovii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of an ornamental plant collection. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions of the country. It is now considered a potential environmental weed due to its invasive growth habits.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas where it has established itself in the wild.</p>
