<p>Alafia alba, commonly known as the white spider plant, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its long, arching stems that bear clusters of small, white, spider-like flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-white berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Alafia alba thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its delicate appearance and ability to bloom throughout the growing season.</p>
