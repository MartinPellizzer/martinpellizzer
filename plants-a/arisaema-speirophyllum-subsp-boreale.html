<p>Arisaema speirophyllum subsp.</p>
<p>boreale, commonly known as the northern thread-leaf arum, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China. It features a distinctive underground tuber and produces a single, narrow, spirally twisted leaf that is often covered in a dense layer of fine, thread-like hairs.</p>
<p>The plant's inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, which is usually greenish-white in color. It blooms in late spring to early summer, with small, inconspicuous flowers clustered along the spadix.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
