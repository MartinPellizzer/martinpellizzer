<p>Anemidictyon hirtum, commonly known as the hairy anemidictyon, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
