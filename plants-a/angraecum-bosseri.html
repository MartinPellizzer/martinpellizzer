<p>Angraecum bosseri, commonly known as the Bosserâ€™s orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces intricate, spurred petals and a unique, elongated labellum, typical of the Angraecum genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled settings to ensure its survival.</p>
