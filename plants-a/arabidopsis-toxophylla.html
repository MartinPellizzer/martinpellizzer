                    <h1>Arabidopsis toxophylla</h1>
<p>Arabidopsis toxophylla, commonly known as the desert mustard, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and broccoli. The plant has small, green, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Its short life cycle and ability to thrive in extreme conditions make it an important subject in botanical and ecological studies.</p>
