<p>Smooth lady's mantle, scientifically known as Alchemilla glaberrima var. gracilis, is a delicate and charming member of the Rosaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. Its distinctive silver-green foliage and clusters of tiny white flowers make it a striking addition to any garden. Often referred to as a "lady's mantle" due to its appearance resembling a protective cloak, it has been used historically for its medicinal properties. This resilient plant is both ornamental and practical, offering beauty and potential health benefits.</p>
