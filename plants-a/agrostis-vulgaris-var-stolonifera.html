                    <h1>Agrostis vulgaris var. stolonifera</h1>
<p>Agrostis vulgaris var. stolonifera, commonly known as common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It forms dense mats through its stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually a dull green, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in turfgrass mixes for its durability and fine texture.</p>
