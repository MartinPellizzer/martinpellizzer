                    <h1>Alyssum pseudocalycinum</h1>
<p>Alyssum pseudocalycinum, commonly known as the desert alyssum, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with dense clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Alyssum pseudocalycinum is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
