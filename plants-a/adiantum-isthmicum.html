                <h1>Adiantum isthmicum</h1>
<p>Adiantum isthmicum, commonly known as the Isthmian maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi-lobed. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in forest understories. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, finely divided structure.</p>
<p>Adiantum isthmicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum isthmicum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, typically arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually light green, with a slender, upright growth pattern and can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant lacks true flowers and instead reproduces via spores, with sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. It has a short, unbranched stem that is slender and covered in a smooth, greenish-brown bark.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, aiding in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum isthmicum is primarily native to Panama.</p>
<p>This fern is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in humid lowland areas. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. The plant is commonly seen in the Caribbean slope of Panama.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely tied to the region's unique climate and biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum isthmicum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. This fern is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, lace-like fronds. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to spread into natural habitats.</p>
