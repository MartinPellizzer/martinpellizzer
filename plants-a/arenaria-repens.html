                    <h1>Arenaria repens</h1>
<p>Arenaria repens, commonly known as sandspoon, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a ground cover.</p>
