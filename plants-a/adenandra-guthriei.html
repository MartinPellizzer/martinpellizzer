                <h1>Adenandra guthriei</h1>
<p>Adenandra guthriei, commonly known as Guthrie's adenandra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Proteaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South Africa, specifically the Western Cape region, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, clustered inflorescences that bloom in spring. Its flowers are typically pink or white, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>Adenandra guthriei is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and adaptability to coastal conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra guthriei has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin, vertical strips as the plant matures. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in dense, branched inflorescences, and bloom during the summer months; they are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animal consumption and dropping.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils while absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra guthriei is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of Africa, specifically in countries such as South Africa, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky outcrops, coastal cliffs, and dry, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in warm, arid to semi-arid climates and is often associated with mountainous and coastal habitats. It is a hardy shrub that is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a regional endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra guthriei was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses due to its ornamental value and adaptability. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistent moisture during its growing season. It is particularly popular in regions such as Hawaii, Southeast Asia, and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments.</p>
