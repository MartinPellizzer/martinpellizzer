<p>Acrostichum aureum var. urvillei, commonly known as the golden sword fern, is a variant of the golden fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its broad, leathery, sword-shaped fronds that are typically golden to dark green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats or colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately compound, with short, stout pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
