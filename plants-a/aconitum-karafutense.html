<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple to blue bell-shaped flowers. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

Its flowers are large, showy, and borne in clusters at the top of the stem, featuring spurred petals in shades of blue to purple, blooming in late summer, and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, black, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
