                <h1>Actinidia umbelloides</h1>
<p>Actinidia umbelloides, commonly known as the Chinese mayapple, is a deciduous shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that appear in umbel-like clusters, typically in early spring. Its fruit is a yellowish berry that ripens in late summer, attracting various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Actinidia umbelloides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia umbelloides has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in umbels, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, yellowish berry that ripens in late summer, and the seeds are dispersed by birds and through the shedding of the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a shallow network, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia umbelloides is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>This species is found in the mountainous regions of this area. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The plant is commonly associated with forested habitats.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of southern and central China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia umbelloides was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of ornamental plant introductions due to its attractive foliage and unique fruiting characteristics. The plant has since become naturalized in several areas, spreading beyond its original cultivation sites. It is commonly found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential remains a topic of ongoing ecological study and management.</p>
