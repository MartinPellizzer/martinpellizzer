                <h1>Actaea muliensis</h1>
<p>Actaea muliensis, commonly known as the Yunnan actaea, is a perennial herb native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea muliensis has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside.</p>
<p>The stems are smooth and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and they grow upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers with five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruits are red, berry-like structures that contain numerous small seeds, dispersed primarily by birds and through wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, helping the plant to store nutrients and survive in its woodland habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea muliensis is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of central China, particularly in provinces such as Sichuan, Hubei, and Hunan. It thrives in moist, shaded forest environments at moderate elevations. The species is known for its distinctive appearance and is often found in undergrowth areas of temperate deciduous forests.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific regions within China South-Central, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea muliensis was mainly introduced to North America through horticultural trade and ecological restoration efforts.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas and stream banks. The plant has become established in several regions, particularly in the northeastern United States. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, careful monitoring is recommended to prevent its spread into sensitive ecosystems.</p>
