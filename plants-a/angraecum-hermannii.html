                    <h1>Angraecum hermannii</h1>
<p>Angraecum hermannii, commonly known as Hermann's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It features long, slender stems and large, showy white or pale pink flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. The plant has a unique adaptation called a "candle" stem, which allows it to store water and nutrients during dry periods. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings.</p>
