                    <h1>Angostura toxicaria</h1>
<p>Angostura toxicaria, commonly known as the Mexican devil's backbone, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces toxic alkaloids, which make it potentially harmful to animals and humans if ingested. Its unique morphology and chemical composition make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance.</p>
