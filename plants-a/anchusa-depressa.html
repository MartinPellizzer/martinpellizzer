<p>Anchusa depressa, commonly known as the carpet bugloss, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features mat-forming stems that spread across the ground, covered in dense, woolly foliage. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Anchusa depressa is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental value.</p>
