                <h1>Aegialinites annulatus</h1>
<p>Aegialinites annulatus, commonly known as the ringed calcified alga, is a fossilized organism that represents a type of marine alga.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its calcified, cylindrical structure with concentric rings, which are indicative of its growth patterns. This plant thrived in shallow marine environments during the Paleozoic era. Its structure suggests it was a colonial organism, possibly related to modern green algae.</p>
<p>The fossil is often found in sedimentary rock layers, providing valuable insights into ancient marine ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegialinites annulatus has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a smooth upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a rough, fibrous bark that is brown in color and exhibits a creeping growth pattern along the ground. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers with a single pistil and stamens, typically blooming in early spring, and is pollinated by wind due to its lack of showy petals. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, helping it anchor in coastal soils and absorb nutrients from the sandy substrate.</p>
