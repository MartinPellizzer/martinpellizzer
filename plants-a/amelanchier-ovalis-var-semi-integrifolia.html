                    <h1>Amelanchier ovalis var. semi-integrifolia</h1>
<p>Amelanchier ovalis var. semi-integrifolia, commonly known as the Allegheny serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features oval, slightly toothed leaves that are semi-integrifoliate, meaning they have a partially smooth margin with some teeth. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, dark purple berries in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open woods.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and pollinators.</p>
