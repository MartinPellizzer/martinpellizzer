<p>Acalypha pubiflora subsp.</p>
<p>australica, commonly known as the Australian copperleaf, is a shrub native to Australia. It features palmate leaves with a distinctive reddish or copper-colored underside, which becomes more pronounced in sunlight.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that are followed by fleshy, red or orange berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha pubiflora subsp.</p>
<p>australica has ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and reddish-brown in color, with a growth pattern that is upright and branching.</p>
<p>Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with bright red bracts that enclose the pale yellow flowers, blooming from late winter to early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha pubiflora subsp.</p>
<p>australica is a flowering plant native to the south-eastern region of Australia, specifically in New South Wales and Victoria. Its current distribution is limited to fragmented populations in coastal and lowland areas, primarily in the temperate regions of these states.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to semi-shaded environments, such as rainforests and understoreys. This subspecies is typically found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 600 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is listed as vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha pubiflora subsp.</p>
<p>australica is a striking ornamental shrub known for its vibrant foliage and unique flower spikes. It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings offering the quickest and most reliable results. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a year under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant and encourage bushiness are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with plants like geraniums or marigolds can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>
