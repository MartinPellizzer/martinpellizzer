                            <h1>Angelica Venenosa Subsp. Dentata</h1>
<p>Angelica venenosa subsp. dentata is a striking yet toxic member of the Apiaceae family known for its tall stature and distinctive appearance. Found primarily in mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments. Its feathery leaves and showy white flowers make it visually appealing, but its potent toxins warn of its dangerous nature. Despite its beauty, it is often mistaken for edible relatives, leading to accidental poisoning. This plant serves as both a botanical curiosity and a reminder of nature's hidden dangers.</p>
