                    <h1>Aconitum unguiculatum</h1>
<p>Aconitum unguiculatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately divided and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>Aconitum unguiculatum contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>
