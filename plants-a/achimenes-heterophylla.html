                <h1>Achimenes heterophylla</h1>
<p>Achimenes heterophylla, commonly known as the velvetleaf *achimenes*, is a tropical perennial plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with contrasting yellow throats. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often grown as an ornamental in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
<p>Achimenes heterophylla is known for its ability to produce numerous tubers, which allow it to survive in adverse conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes heterophylla has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a greenish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are trumpet-shaped with five petals, typically in shades of pink or red, blooming from summer to autumn, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, helping the plant store nutrients and survive in varying environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes heterophylla is primarily native to Guatemala, Mexico Central, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Northwest, Mexico Southeast, and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories or near streams. The species is known for its vibrant flowers and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its adaptation to the diverse climates within these Mexican and Guatemalan regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes heterophylla was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its vibrant flowers and attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and greenhouses in countries such as the United States, Australia, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming an invasive species in certain areas where it outcompetes native flora.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, careful management is needed to prevent its spread beyond cultivated areas.</p>
