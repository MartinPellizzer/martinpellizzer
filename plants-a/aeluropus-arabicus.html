                <h1>Aeluropus arabicus</h1>
<p>Aeluropus arabicus, commonly known as the Arabian sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and inland desert margins.</p>
<p>Aeluropus arabicus plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeluropus arabicus has narrow, grass-like leaves that are flat, linear, and typically less than 5 cm in length, with a bluish-green color and parallel venation.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, rigid, and often has a slightly rough texture, growing in dense clumps or tussocks. The flowers are small, spike-like clusters with pale blue to purple florets, blooming from spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize sandy soils and retain moisture.</p>
