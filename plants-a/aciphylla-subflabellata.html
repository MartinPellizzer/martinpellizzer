                <h1>Aciphylla subflabellata</h1>
<p>Aciphylla subflabellata, commonly known as the flabellate pincushion, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flower heads that are typically clustered in a rounded shape. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciphylla subflabellata has succulent, fleshy leaves that are spoon-shaped (spatulate) and arranged in a rosette pattern, with a bluish-green color and a waxy texture to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, grayish bark that grows upright from the ground. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom in spring; they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb moisture from the arid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla subflabellata is primarily native to the South Island of New Zealand.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in the alpine and subalpine regions, growing in rocky or gravelly soils. It is often associated with open habitats such as hillsides and mountain slopes. The species is well adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its native environment.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in the native flora of New Zealand's southern regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla subflabellata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with dense, silver-gray foliage. The species is commonly found in coastal and alpine environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping and restoration projects.</p>
