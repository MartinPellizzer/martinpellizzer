<p>Aconitum yachiangense, commonly known as Yachiang Aconite, is a perennial herb native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy flowers. The plant produces blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately compound, with lobed divisions that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Aconitum yachiangense contains toxic alkaloids, making it a plant that requires careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum yachiangense has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a deep green color and serrated margins, typically reaching up to 20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and has a grayish-brown bark that becomes rough with age, growing in a straight, unbranched pattern. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense spikes, featuring showy petals and a spurred structure, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storage and anchoring the plant in moist, temperate habitats.</p>
