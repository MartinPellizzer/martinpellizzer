                <h1>Aconitum senanense</h1>
<p>Aconitum senanense, commonly known as the Senan mountain aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a spicate inflorescence. Its roots contain potent alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>
<p>Aconitum senanense is often found in moist, shaded environments at higher elevations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum senanense has palmate leaves that are large, deeply lobed, and typically green with a slightly hairy underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hollow, and has a smooth, dark green bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petals and a spurs-like structure, blooming in late summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The plant produces follicles as fruits, containing small, flat seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are tuberous, thick, and adapted for storage, allowing it to survive in rocky or poor soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum senanense is primarily native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the southern and central areas. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly associated with forested habitats. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>The plant is also occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum senanense was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 2000s in Washington State. The plant is commonly found in moist, shaded forest environments. It has since spread to parts of Oregon and British Columbia.</p>
<p>Its introduction is believed to be due to ornamental planting and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
