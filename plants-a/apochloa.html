                    <h1>Apochloa</h1>
<p>Apochloa, commonly known as the false grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. These plants typically have slender, grass-like foliage and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. Apochloa species are often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>They are generally not cultivated for agricultural purposes but are of interest in botanical studies due to their unique morphological features.</p>
