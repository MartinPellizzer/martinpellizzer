<p>Aruba crustacea, commonly known as the Aruban crustacean plant, is a unique species native to the island of Aruba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning. Its root system is adapted to absorb nutrients from the rocky soil.</p>
<p>Aruba crustacea is valued for its resilience and is often cultivated in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
