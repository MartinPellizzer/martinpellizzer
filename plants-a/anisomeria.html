                    <h1>Anisomeria</h1>
<p>Anisomeria, commonly known as desert star, is a genus of flowering plants native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their woody stems and aromatic foliage. The leaves are often narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Anisomeria species produce small, yellowish or white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
