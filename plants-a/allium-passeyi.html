                    <h1>Allium passeyi</h1>
<p>Allium passeyi, commonly known as Passey's leek, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in taste to onions but are less commonly cultivated. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is often considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
