                    <h1>Aegilops peregrina var. elongata</h1>
<p>Aegilops peregrina var. elongata, commonly known as the slender wild barley, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated spikelets and narrow leaves, which are typically less than 2 mm in width. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is often found growing in fields, along roadsides, and in dry, rocky areas.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to modern wheat varieties.</p>
