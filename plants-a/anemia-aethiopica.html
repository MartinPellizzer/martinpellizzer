                    <h1>Anemia aethiopica</h1>
<p>Anemia aethiopica, commonly known as African iron deficiency anemia, is a type of microcytic anemia characterized by a reduction in hemoglobin and red blood cell size.</p>
<p>It is primarily caused by chronic iron deficiency, often due to poor dietary intake or increased demand during pregnancy and childhood. The condition is prevalent in regions with high rates of malnutrition and parasitic infections. Botanically, it is not a plant but a medical condition; however, it is associated with the consumption of certain plants that may contribute to iron deficiency.</p>
<p>The name "aethiopica" refers to its historical association with Ethiopia, where it was commonly observed.</p>
