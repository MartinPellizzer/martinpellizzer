                    <h1>Avena pseudosativa</h1>
<p>Avena pseudosativa, commonly known as false oat, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides.</p>
<p>While not as widely cultivated as true oats, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening or as a forage crop.</p>
