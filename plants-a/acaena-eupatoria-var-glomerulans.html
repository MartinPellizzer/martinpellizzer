<p>Acaena eupatoria var. glomerulans, commonly known as the clustered burr plant, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny clusters of fruits that form in the axils of the leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of the distinctive, woody, barbed burrs. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun.</p>
<p>This species is often found in coastal and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
