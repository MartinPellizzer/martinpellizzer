                    <h1>Andinia lueri</h1>
<p>Andinia lueri, commonly known as the Luer's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant produces small, greenish-brown pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its humid, shaded habitat. Its flowers are highly specialized, with intricate structures that facilitate pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Andinia lueri is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
