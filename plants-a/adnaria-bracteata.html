                <h1>Adnaria bracteata</h1>
<p>Adnaria bracteata, commonly known as the bracted adnaria, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenia plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a smooth, glossy surface.</p>
<p>Adnaria bracteata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria bracteata has compound leaves that are pinnate in arrangement, with elliptical to lanceolate leaflets that are typically green and medium in size.</p>
<p>The stem is woody and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exudes a mild fragrance. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria bracteata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with high humidity and warm climates. This plant thrives in coastal and mangrove environments, often growing in sandy or muddy soils near the shoreline. It is also occasionally reported in parts of India and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria bracteata was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as trade and horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and wetlands, where it thrives in moist, saline conditions. This plant has become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native species for resources. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a challenging species to control.</p>
<p>Proper management strategies are essential to prevent its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
