                <h1>Adenia ecirrosa</h1>
<p>Adenia ecirrosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved adenia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Randiaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are berries that turn red when mature, attracting various bird species.</p>
<p>Adenia ecirrosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and thickets.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia ecirrosa has compound leaves that are pinnate, with lanceolate leaflets arranged alternately along the stem, and they are typically green with a slightly pubescent surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, bark that is reddish-brown and has a fibrous texture, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring showy yellow petals and stamen, blooming during the wet season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia ecirrosa is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the eastern and southern parts of the island, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. It typically grows in dense forest understories and along riverbanks. Adenia ecirrosa is well adapted to the unique biodiversity of Madagascar.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to this region due to its specific ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia ecirrosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It is often seen growing along the edges of forests and in open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become naturalized in several regions of the country.</p>
