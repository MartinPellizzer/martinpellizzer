<p>Asplenium nubilum, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often appear in a compact, cushion-like form. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
