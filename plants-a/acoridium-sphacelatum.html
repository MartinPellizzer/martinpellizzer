                <h1>Acoridium sphacelatum</h1>
<p>Acoridium sphacelatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a species of aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It has long, narrow leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that emerge from the water surface. It is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in shallow, still waters.</p>
<p>Acoridium sphacelatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoridium sphacelatum has leaves that are typically broad and strap-like, arranged in a basal rosette, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is short and stout, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unbranched. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in spikes, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium sphacelatum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with forest understories or rocky habitats. It is also present in parts of southern China and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium sphacelatum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions. This plant has spread to various regions outside its native range, including parts of the United States and Europe. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
