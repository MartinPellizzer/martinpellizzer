                    <h1>Acer hispanicum var. nevadense</h1>
<p>Acer hispanicum var. nevadense, commonly known as the Sierra Madre maple, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Spain.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, palmately lobed leaves that are typically bright green during the growing season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
