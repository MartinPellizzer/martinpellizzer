<p>Amyema wichmannii subsp.</p>
<p>purum, commonly known as the red-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southern Australia. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and reddish stems.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as eucalyptus, and derives some of its nutrients from the host. It produces small white or pale green flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its unique parasitic growth habit.</p>
