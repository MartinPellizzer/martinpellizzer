Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and often producing spores. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many ancient and primitive angiosperms with diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes many plants with distinctive floral arrangements and often contains species adapted to arid environments. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, a family of flowering plants commonly known as the leadwort family, characterized by their often blue or purple flowers and specialized seed structures. Its genus is Acantholimon, a genus of flowering plants in the family Plumbaginaceae, typically characterized by succulent leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon auganum, a specific plant within the genus Acantholimon, known for its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon auganum is primarily native to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Tadzhikistan, and the West Himalaya.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in alpine and subalpine regions, growing in rocky and gravelly soils. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often in mountainous areas with cool and moist conditions. The species is part of the Caryophyllaceae family and is adapted to the harsh climate of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific regions, reflecting its ecological preferences and environmental constraints.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
