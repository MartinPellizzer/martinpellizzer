<p>Actinotus moorei, commonly known as the Moore's star flower, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden winds. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder.</p>
<p>Actinotus moorei is a low-growing perennial that thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinotus moorei has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, and has a smooth, greyish-brown bark. Its flowers are clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and attracting insects for pollination. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in its rocky or sandy habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinotus moorei is primarily native to Tasmania.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the southern and eastern regions of the island, particularly in areas with moist, temperate climates. It typically grows in forested areas and along stream banks. Actinotus moorei is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of Tasmania's native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to specific habitats within the state.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinotus moorei was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the northern and central regions of the country. This plant thrives in coastal and lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. It is often seen growing in open habitats such as dunes and coastal scrub.</p>
<p>Actinotus moorei is valued for its ornamental appeal and has become a part of the local flora in its introduced range.</p>
