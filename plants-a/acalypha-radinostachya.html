Its class is Equisetopsida, which consists of a group of vascular plants that includes horsetails and includes species with jointed stems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is characterized by a wide range of floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a diverse group of flowering plants that includes many species with unique floral and leaf structures. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with a wide variety of growth forms and often contains toxic compounds. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "caper spurge," characterized by their often hairy leaves and showy inflorescences.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha radinostachya, a specific plant within the genus Acalypha that is known for its distinctive floral structure and is native to certain regions of Africa.</p>
