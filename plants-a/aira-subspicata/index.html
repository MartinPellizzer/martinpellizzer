                            <h1>Aira Subspicata</h1>
<p>Aira subspicata is a small, flowering plant native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is commonly known as the basket grass due to its distinctive, spike-like inflorescence. This species is often found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Its delicate flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Despite its modest appearance, Aira subspicata plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems.</p>
