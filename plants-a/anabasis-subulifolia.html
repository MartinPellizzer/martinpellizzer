                    <h1>Anabasis subulifolia</h1>
<p>Anabasis subulifolia, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub with small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Anabasis subulifolia is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
