                <h1>Adonis sachalinensis</h1>
<p>Adonis sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin adonis, is a perennial herb native to the Russian Far East and northern Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis sachalinensis has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and covered with fine hairs, growing upright with a branching pattern near the base. Its flowers are yellow, consisting of five petals and five sepals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis sachalinensis is primarily native to Sakhalin.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of this island, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant is adapted to the cold climate and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is a rare and endangered species, with a limited geographic range.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect its natural habitat and ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis sachalinensis was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the United States and Canada, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, showy flowers.</p>
<p>It was first introduced in the late 19th century and has since spread to various regions, especially in the Pacific Northwest. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges. Despite its beauty, it has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
