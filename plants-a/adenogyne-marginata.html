                <h1>Adenogyne marginata</h1>
<p>Adenogyne marginata, commonly known as the marginate adenogyne, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves with serrated margins and showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or white. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenogyne marginata has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elongated, serrated leaflets that range from 5 to 10 cm in length, exhibiting a dark green color with a slight variegation.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to dry conditions by storing water efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogyne marginata is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and swampy areas where the climate is humid and the soil is rich in organic matter. This plant thrives in shaded environments and is often associated with the understory vegetation in these ecosystems. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats that provide the necessary moisture and light conditions for its growth.</p>
<p>Adenogyne marginata is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogyne marginata was mainly introduced to new habitats in the Pacific Islands through human activity, such as intentional planting for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>It has since spread across various coastal and lowland areas, thriving in disturbed soils and open environments. The plant's rapid growth and ability to reproduce through both seeds and vegetative propagation have contributed to its widespread distribution. It is now considered an invasive species in several regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact on local ecosystems.</p>
