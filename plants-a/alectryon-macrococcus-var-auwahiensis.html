<p>Alectryon macrococcus var. auwahiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian Christmasberry, is a small shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright red, fleshy berries that resemble Christmas ornaments, hence its common name. The plant has simple, alternate leaves and produces small white flowers that are visited by various pollinators. It thrives in coastal and lowland habitats, often found in dry to mesic forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation efforts.</p>
