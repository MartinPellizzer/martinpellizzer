<p>Azaola betis, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in saline environments.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which allow it to absorb oxygen from the air in waterlogged soils. The plant's leaves are alternate and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and filtering pollutants from water.</p>
<p>Azaola betis is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in the Americas.</p>
