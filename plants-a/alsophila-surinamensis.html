<p>Alsophila surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a rhizome that grows underground, supporting the upright stem and anchoring the plant in soil. Its fronds are typically dark green and can reach lengths of up to several meters, contributing to its striking appearance in forest understories.</p>
<p>Alsophila surinamensis plays a role in tropical ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
