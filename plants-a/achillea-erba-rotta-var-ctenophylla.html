                <h1>Achillea erba-rotta var. ctenophylla</h1>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta var. ctenophylla, commonly known as the featherleaf yarrow, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feathery leaves that give it its common name, and it produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta var. ctenophylla has leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a grayish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta var. ctenophylla is a variant of the yarrow plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, particularly in the Alps.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Austria, Switzerland, and southern Germany, where it thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. This plant prefers well-drained soils and is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas, though it remains relatively stable in protected alpine environments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta var. ctenophylla is a hardy perennial known for its fern-like foliage and delicate white flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or slugs, which can be managed with organic controls.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta var. ctenophylla is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, contributing to local biodiversity. This plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other species in a mixed garden or wildflower meadow. Its dense foliage also helps with erosion control by stabilizing soil in open areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers shelter and habitat for small insects and invertebrates, enhancing the overall ecological balance of its environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta var. ctenophylla is a lesser-known variant of the yarrow plant, primarily valued for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Historically, it has been used in traditional medicine to treat wounds, inflammation, and digestive issues due to its anti-inflammatory and astringent qualities. While not widely cultivated for culinary use, its essential oils may find applications in the fragrance and cosmetic industries. Its association with healing and protection has given it symbolic significance in various cultures.</p>
<p>However, due to its limited cultivation and research, its industrial and economic potential remains largely unexplored.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta var. ctenophylla has several popular cultivars such as 'Avalanche' and 'The Pearl,' which are prized for their dense, silvery foliage and vibrant flower colors.</p>
<p>This variety is also involved in the creation of hybrids that combine its ornamental traits with those of other yarrow species, enhancing garden versatility. Its horticultural importance lies in its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in full sun, making it a valuable addition to rock gardens and borders. The plant's compact growth habit and long blooming period further contribute to its popularity among gardeners.</p>
<p>Overall, it plays a significant role in modern horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ease of cultivation.</p>
