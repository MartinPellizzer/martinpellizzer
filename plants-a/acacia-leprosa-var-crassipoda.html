                    <h1>Acacia leprosa var. crassipoda</h1>
<p>Acacia leprosa var. crassipoda, commonly known as the broad-leaved wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow flowers and compound leaves with phyllodes that are broader and more robust compared to other acacia species. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for honeyeaters and supporting various insect populations.</p>
<p>The varietal distinction is primarily based on the broader phyllodes and slightly different growth form.</p>
