                <h1>Acosta calolepis</h1>
<p>Acosta calolepis, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant features showy, five-petaled flowers that are usually bright yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a hairy texture.</p>
<p>Acosta calolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta calolepis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures, and it grows in a creeping or ascending manner. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta calolepis is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude areas, typically between 2,500 and 4,000 meters above sea level. This plant thrives in rocky soils and is often associated with paramo ecosystems. It is well adapted to the cold and humid conditions of the Andes.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and localized in its distribution.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta calolepis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in temperate climates, particularly in the southern United States and parts of South America. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
