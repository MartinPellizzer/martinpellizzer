                <h1>Adesmia lihuelensis</h1>
<p>Adesmia lihuelensis, commonly known as the Lihuel bush, is a shrub native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features small, compound leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by animals.</p>
<p>Adesmia lihuelensis is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia lihuelensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white or pale pink petals, and they bloom during the spring season; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia lihuelensis is primarily native to Argentina Northeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the northeastern region of Argentina, specifically in the provinces of Corrientes and Misiones. This plant typically grows in humid, subtropical environments with well-drained soils. It is commonly observed in native grasslands and along riverbanks in this area.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to this specific region, making it a characteristic flora of the northeastern Argentine ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia lihuelensis was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile, as part of ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its introduction has led to its spread beyond its original range, sometimes becoming invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is now considered an important species for soil stabilization and biodiversity in some areas.</p>
