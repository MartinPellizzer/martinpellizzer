                    <h1>Actinostachys plana</h1>
<p>Actinostachys plana, commonly known as the flat-stemmed clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that are typically covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces strobila, which are cone-like structures that contain the sporangia for spore production. Actinostachys plana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and ancient lineage make it an important subject in the study of early land plant evolution.</p>
