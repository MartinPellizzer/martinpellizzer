                <h1>Aconitum murrianum</h1>
<p>Aconitum murrianum, commonly known as the Japanese monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It features striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble the shape of a hand. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often grown in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum murrianum has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, typically green with a slightly hairy texture, and can reach up to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hollow, and covered with a smooth, dark green to brown bark, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in dense clusters, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through wind dispersal, and the seeds are small, winged, and light.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous, fibrous, and capable of storing nutrients for the plant's survival.</p>
