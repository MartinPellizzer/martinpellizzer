<p>Acoridium edentulum, commonly known as the slender swamp lily, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and establish in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Acoridium edentulum plays a role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
