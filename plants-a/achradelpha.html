                    <h1>Achradelpha</h1>
<p>Achradelpha, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a white or pale green center. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Achradelpha is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
