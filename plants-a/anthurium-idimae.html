<p>Anthurium idimae, commonly known as the Idimae arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>

The plant produces bright red spadices, which are the inflorescences that house the tiny, white flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Anthurium idimae is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and air-purifying qualities.</p>
