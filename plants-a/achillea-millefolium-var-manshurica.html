<p>It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are gray-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. manshurica has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are narrow and linear, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, branching, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark, growing in a compact, bushy pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in flat-topped umbels, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene enclosed in a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. manshurica is a variant of the common yarrow that is native to the Russian Far East, specifically the Primorsky and Khabarovsk regions.</p>
<p>It is now found in parts of eastern Russia and has been introduced to other areas, including parts of China and Korea. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>The conservation status of this variant is currently listed as least concern, although it remains relatively rare and localized in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. manshurica is a hardy perennial known for its feathery foliage and bright yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a dormant winter growth cycle, blooming in early summer and going dormant in late fall.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering help maintain its vigor. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. manshurica is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering shelter and habitat within its dense foliage. This plant acts as an effective companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its ability to suppress weeds and improve soil structure. Additionally, it plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its presence also contributes to biodiversity by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. manshurica is a variant of yarrow known for its diverse uses across various fields.</p>
