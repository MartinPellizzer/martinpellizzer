<p>Anabasis triandra, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Anabasis triandra is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine and landscaping in dry climates.</p>
