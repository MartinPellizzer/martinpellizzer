<p>Anisophyllum congenerum, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, feathery fronds that are usually less than a foot in length. Its rhizomes are short and often form dense clusters, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>Anisophyllum congenerum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shady garden settings.</p>
