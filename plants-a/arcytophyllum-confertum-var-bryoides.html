                    <h1>Arcytophyllum confertum var. bryoides</h1>
<p>Arcytophyllum confertum var. bryoides, commonly known as the dwarf sagebrush, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are densely packed, providing a dense cover that helps reduce soil erosion. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. It is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of its native habitat's flora.</p>
