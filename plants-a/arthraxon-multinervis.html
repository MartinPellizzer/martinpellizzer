<p>Arthraxon multinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense stands in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, three-ranked flowers, and it produces three-nerved, boat-shaped fruits.</p>
