<p>Acalypha tenuis, commonly known as the narrowleaf beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale purple to white flowers. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Acalypha tenuis typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and thickets.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha tenuis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, and a bright green color that may turn slightly reddish in some varieties.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and slightly woody, with a smooth texture and a light green to brownish color, growing upright with a somewhat branching pattern. The flowers are small and clustered in spikes, with a greenish-white color, blooming during the summer months, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-winged capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, allowing the plant to spread over short distances.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha tenuis is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other tropical and subtropical regions around the world. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth and along stream banks. It typically grows at altitudes between 0 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its natural habitat faces threats from deforestation and habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha tenuis is a small, flowering shrub native to tropical regions, known for its vibrant, fuzzy leaves and showy bracts.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites.</p>
