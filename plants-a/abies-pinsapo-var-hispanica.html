                        <h1>Abies pinsapo var. hispanica</h1>
<p>Abies pinsapo var. hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the Sierra de Cazorla in southern Spain.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally along the branches. The tree produces cones that are typically 5â€“8 centimeters long, containing winged seeds for wind dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, often growing in rocky or mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss.</p>
