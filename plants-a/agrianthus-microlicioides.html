<p>Agrianthus microlicioides, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as oaks and pines, and derives its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white in color. Its berries, which are typically red or black, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Agrianthus microlicioides plays a significant role in forest ecosystems, influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
