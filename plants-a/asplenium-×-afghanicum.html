                    <h1>Asplenium × afghanicum</h1>
<p>Asplenium × afghanicum, commonly known as the Afghan spleenwort, is a hybrid fern species native to regions of Central and South Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow in dense clusters. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which release spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique genetic makeup, it is of interest to botanists studying hybridization in ferns.</p>
