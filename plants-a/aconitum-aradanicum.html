                <h1>Aconitum aradanicum</h1>
<p>Aconitum aradanicum, commonly known as the Armenian monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It features striking purple to blue flowers arranged in a spire-like inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply veined and covered in a soft, hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum aradanicum has large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure up to 30 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and typically has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petals and a spurred shape, blooming in summer and pollinated primarily by bees. The plant produces follicles as its fruit, containing small, black seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are thick, fleshy, and extensively branched, helping it to store nutrients and survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
