                <h1>Acer oliverianum subvar. formosanum</h1>
<p>Acer oliverianum subvar. formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan maple, is a deciduous tree native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The species is relatively rare and is considered an important component of the local flora in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum subvar. formosanum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and arranged in upright clusters, blooming in early spring, and are primarily wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's natural habitat in mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum subvar. formosanum is a rare and critically endangered maple species native to the mountainous regions of Taiwan.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to the central and southern parts of the island, where it grows in humid, temperate climates. Currently, its distribution is restricted to a few isolated populations, primarily in the Central Mountain Range. It thrives in shaded, moist environments at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum subvar. formosanum is a small, ornamental tree known for its delicate, lace-like foliage and autumn coloration.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering more reliable results. The growth cycle involves a slow development, reaching maturity in 10–15 years, with a preference for cool, moist climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires consistent watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from scale or aphids.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-tolerant species like ferns or hostas can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum subvar. formosanum is a valuable native plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and promoting the growth of other native flora. Its dense foliage helps in erosion control, especially along riverbanks and slopes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and offers habitat for birds and other forest-dwelling organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum subvar. formosanum is a lesser-known species of maple native to Taiwan, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its wood has been historically utilized in local crafts and small-scale industries. In traditional medicine, it has been employed for its potential anti-inflammatory properties, though scientific validation remains limited. Culturally, it holds symbolic importance in Taiwanese flora, representing regional biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting local ecosystems and promoting environmental awareness also highlights its ecological and economic value in conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum subvar. formosanum has a limited number of recognized varieties, but it is more commonly appreciated through its cultivars and hybrids.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Variegatum', which are valued for their striking foliage colors. Hybrids involving this species are often created to enhance ornamental traits such as leaf color and growth form. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden settings.</p>
<p>They are widely cultivated in temperate regions for their ornamental value in parks and private landscapes.</p>
