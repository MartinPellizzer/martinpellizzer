<p>Angorkis filangis, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a shimmering appearance under moonlight. The plant produces small, pale green spore cones that are clustered along the undersides of its fronds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires indirect sunlight to prevent leaf scorching.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is highly sought after by botanists and plant enthusiasts alike.</p>
