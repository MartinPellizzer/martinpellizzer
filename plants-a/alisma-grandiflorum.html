<p>It features arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers with six petals, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in shallow water and moist soil.</p>
<p>Alisma grandiflorum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians.</p>
