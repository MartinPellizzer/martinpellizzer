                    <h1>Arundo vallatoria</h1>
<p>Arundo vallatoria, commonly known as the narrowleaf reed, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has long, slender leaves that are often narrower than those of its close relatives, such as Arundo donax. It produces tall, cylindrical flower spikes that release lightweight seeds for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can be both ecologically beneficial and invasive in certain environments.</p>
