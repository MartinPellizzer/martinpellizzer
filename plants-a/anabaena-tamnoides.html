<p>Anabaena tamnoides, commonly known as the blue-green alga, is a type of cyanobacteria that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems. The plant forms filamentous colonies composed of cylindrical cells connected by cross-walls. It often appears as a green to blue-green scum on the surface of ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Anabaena tamnoides plays a significant role in both ecological and biotechnological applications due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.</p>
