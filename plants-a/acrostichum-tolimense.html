                <h1>Acrostichum tolimense</h1>
<p>Acrostichum tolimense, commonly known as the Tolima fern, is a tropical plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats on forest floors.</p>
<p>The Tolima fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum tolimense has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, measuring up to 30 cm in length and 10 cm in width, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, grayish bark that has a slight ridged texture. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind once it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant in wet, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum tolimense is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as humid forests and riverbanks. This fern thrives in areas with high humidity and rich, well-drained soil. It is often associated with cloud forests and lowland tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a regionally endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum tolimense was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and degraded forests. This plant has been reported in various ecological studies due to its adaptability and rapid growth rate. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, more research is needed to fully understand its ecological impact.</p>
