                <h1>Acronychia brassii</h1>
<p>Acronychia brassii, commonly known as the broad-leaved acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to northern Australia, particularly Queensland, and is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or yellow-green in color. Acronychia brassii is often found in rainforest or coastal areas, growing as an understory plant.</p>
<p>Its wood is valued for its durability and is used in traditional crafts and construction.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia brassii has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grayish-brown in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, blooming during the wet season, and is pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in nutrient-poor soils, contributing to its resilience in tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia brassii is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in the eastern and western regions. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich soil. The plant is commonly encountered in lowland and montane forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to New Guinea, with no known presence on other continents.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia brassii was mainly introduced to Australia as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in various regions across the country, particularly in coastal and subtropical areas. Despite its ornamental value, it has shown potential to become invasive in some environments if not managed properly. The plant's spread is often linked to human activities such as landscaping and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists regarding its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
