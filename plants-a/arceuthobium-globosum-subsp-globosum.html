<p>Arceuthobium globosum subsp.</p>
<p>globosum, commonly known as the sticky seed bladder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its small, inflated, bladder-like structures that contain its seeds.</p>
<p>The plant is typically found parasitizing the roots of various woody plants, particularly in forested areas. Its unique reproductive strategy involves the release of sticky seeds that adhere to the fur of animals or the feet of humans.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a minor role in ecosystem dynamics but remains an intriguing subject in botanical studies.</p>
