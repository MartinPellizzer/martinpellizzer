                <h1>Acinodendron theiforme</h1>
<p>Acinodendron theiforme, commonly known as the threadleaf acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Acinodendron theiforme thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it an important component of local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron theiforme has leaves that are simple, alternate, and ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, ranging in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron theiforme is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland forests where it can receive ample sunlight and moisture. This plant is commonly found in primary and secondary tropical rainforests, often growing as an understorey species. It is also known to occur in parts of the Philippines and parts of New Guinea.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed outside of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron theiforme was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can grow in both full sun and partial shade.</p>
<p>Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists in New Zealand.</p>
