<p>Angraecum fournierae, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences bearing white, star-shaped flowers with a distinctive red lip. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot. It is adapted to seasonal rainfall patterns and can go dormant during dry periods.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings.</p>
