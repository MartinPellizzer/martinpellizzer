                <h1>Adenocalymma kerere</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma kerere, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branching.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma kerere is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma kerere has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels off in thin layers. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, with four petals and a tubular structure, blooming during the winter months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma kerere is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grassland and savanna ecosystems, often growing in well-drained soils. This plant is adapted to the dry and semi-arid conditions of its native habitat. It is often used in traditional medicine by local communities.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of suitable grazing lands and water sources.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma kerere was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal regions and along the edges of forests. The plant spreads rapidly through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water. It competes with native vegetation, leading to a decline in biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it requires ongoing management to control its spread.</p>
