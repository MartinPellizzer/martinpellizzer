                    <h1>Acrocentron</h1>
<p>Acrocentron, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are native to the Americas. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and yellow composite flowers that resemble dandelions. Acrocentron species typically grow in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands.</p>
<p>They are often mistaken for true dandelions due to their similar appearance, but they differ in their leaf structure and flowering behavior.</p>
