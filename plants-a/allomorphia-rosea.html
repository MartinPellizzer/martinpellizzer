<p>Allomorphia rosea, commonly known as the pink-flowered allomorph, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking pink petals that bloom in late spring, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has slender, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and requires partial shade to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, Allomorphia rosea is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
