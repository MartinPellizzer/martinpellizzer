<p>Acantholimon laxiflorum, commonly known as the slender-flowered stonecress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves and small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in open habitats such as dunes or gravelly slopes.</p>
<p>Acantholimon laxiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local insect populations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acantholimon laxiflorum has narrow, linear leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a basal rosette, and range in length from 5 to 15 centimeters.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a pale greenish-brown bark that becomes woody with age.
