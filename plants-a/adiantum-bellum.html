                <h1>Adiantum bellum</h1>
<p>Adiantum bellum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a silvery sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced.</p>
<p>Adiantum bellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum bellum has fern-like leaves that are bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, arranged in a pinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically small, ranging from 10 to 20 centimeters in length, with a dark green color that turns bronze in autumn. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a compact, bushy pattern.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum bellum is primarily native to Bermuda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils throughout the island. This fern thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often seen growing in rock crevices and along the edges of dunes.</p>
<p>Adiantum bellum plays an important ecological role in Bermuda's coastal ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum bellum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. This plant is often seen as an ornamental species due to its delicate, fern-like appearance. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
