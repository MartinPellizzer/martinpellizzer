                <h1>Acosta micranthos</h1>
<p>Acosta micranthos, commonly known as the narrow-flower acosta, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of silky hair.</p>
<p>Acosta micranthos is often found in moist, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta micranthos has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or poor soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta micranthos is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems. This plant is commonly associated with rocky soils and mountainous terrain, often growing at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. It is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta micranthos was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 1960s and has since spread throughout the North Island. The plant is now considered a weed in several regions, particularly in agricultural areas. It thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and prevent further ecological impact.</p>
