                <h1>Achyrocline crassiceps</h1>
<p>Achyrocline crassiceps, commonly known as the thick-headed achyrocline, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and saline environments. Its leaves are usually thick and fleshy, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline crassiceps has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged oppositely along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered with a rough, hairy texture, and has a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline crassiceps is primarily native to Colombia and Venezuela.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often in forested areas. Its distribution is closely linked to the humid climate and diverse ecosystems of the Andes and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the local flora in these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline crassiceps was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, vacant lots, and agricultural fields. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common weed in these areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to its widespread distribution across coastal regions of the southeastern U.S. Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some local ecosystems.</p>
