                <h1>Actephila dispersa</h1>
<p>Actephila dispersa, commonly known as the scattered actephila, is a flowering plant species belonging to the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant typically grows as a small shrub or perennial herb, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are usually opposite, elliptical in shape, and have a glossy surface.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and often display a combination of white, yellow, and red hues.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila dispersa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a glossy dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly woody with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, spreading across the soil surface to absorb nutrients and moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila dispersa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland forests and moist habitats. This species thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil, often growing in shaded areas under the canopy. It is also present in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines, where it contributes to the biodiversity of the region's flora.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can be found in a variety of ecological niches within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila dispersa was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has established itself in various regions outside its native range, often thriving in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant's ability to spread via seeds and vegetative reproduction contributes to its successful distribution. It is commonly found in temperate and subtropical areas where it competes with native flora.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, Actephila dispersa has become a concern in some regions as an invasive species.</p>
