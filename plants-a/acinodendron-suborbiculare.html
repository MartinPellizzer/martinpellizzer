                <h1>Acinodendron suborbiculare</h1>
<p>Acinodendron suborbiculare, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by round, fleshy fruits containing smooth, black seeds. It is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron suborbiculare has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>The leaves are medium-sized, typically measuring 5â€“8 cm in length, and are arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern. The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, and have a white to pale yellow color, blooming during the dry season and being pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron suborbiculare is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid lowland forests and is commonly found in the island of Borneo. This species is also present in parts of the Philippines and Singapore. It prefers well-drained soils and is often associated with secondary growth areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its distribution has become fragmented in recent years.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron suborbiculare was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become a problematic invasive species in certain regions of the country. The plant spreads rapidly through seeds and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the risks associated with bringing non-native species into new ecosystems.</p>
