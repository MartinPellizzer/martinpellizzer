                <h1>Acmella flavicaulis</h1>
<p>Acmella flavicaulis, commonly known as the yellow pincushion, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that resemble small pincushions. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
<p>Acmella flavicaulis prefers well-drained soil and full sun exposure for optimal growth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella flavicaulis has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth, dark green surface and a slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and green in color, with a slightly ridged texture and a creeping growth pattern. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella flavicaulis is primarily native to Central and South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Peru, and Colombia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, often growing in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and wetlands. This plant thrives in humid climates and is typically associated with disturbed or secondary growth habitats. It is also known to occur in parts of the Caribbean, including the islands of Cuba and Hispaniola.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and medicinal properties, it has been the subject of botanical and ethnobotanical studies in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella flavicaulis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its bright yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and as a decorative plant in coastal areas. The distribution includes parts of Australia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
