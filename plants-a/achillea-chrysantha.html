<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and feathery leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. It produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea chrysantha has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-gray color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and smooth, with a pale green color and a growth pattern that is mostly erect. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, capsule that contains small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea chrysantha is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed in the coastal and inland regions of these states, often found in dry, rocky habitats. This species thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is commonly found in chaparral and coastal sage scrub environments. It grows at elevations ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Achillea chrysantha is listed as a species of concern in some areas due to habitat loss and limited distribution, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea chrysantha is a hardy perennial known for its bright yellow flowers and drought tolerance.</p>
