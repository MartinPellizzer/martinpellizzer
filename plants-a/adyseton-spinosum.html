                <h1>Adyseton spinosum</h1>
<p>Adyseton spinosum, commonly known as the spiny adyseton, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers in late spring, followed by elliptical, edible berries that are a food source for various wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a subject of ecological study.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adyseton spinosum has compound leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with elongated leaflets that are elliptical in shape, varying in size from 2 to 5 cm, and are usually a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is grayish-brown in color, and it exhibits a sprawling growth pattern with multiple branches. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that contains numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
