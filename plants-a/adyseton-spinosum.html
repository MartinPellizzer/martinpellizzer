                    <h1>Adyseton spinosum</h1>
<p>Adyseton spinosum, commonly known as the spiny adyseton, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers in late spring, followed by elliptical, edible berries that are a food source for various wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a subject of ecological study.</p>
