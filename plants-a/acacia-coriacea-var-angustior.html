                <h1>Acacia coriacea var. angustior</h1>
<p>Acacia coriacea var. angustior, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces yellow flower spikes that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia coriacea var. angustior has narrow, angular leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown to gray in color. The flowers are yellow, clustered in dense cylindrical inflorescences, and bloom during the dry season, being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a pod that splits open to release small, elongated seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture from the arid environment.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia coriacea var. angustior is a variant of the acacia tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of northern Australia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Queensland and the Northern Territory, where it thrives in sandy soils. This plant typically grows in open woodlands and shrublands, often near water sources such as rivers or ephemeral streams. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and degradation, it is considered a species of concern in some areas, though it is not currently listed as endangered at the national level.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia coriacea var. angustior is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a period of cold stratification for optimal germination. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often reaching maturity within several years, and prefers well-drained soil with moderate watering.</p>
<p>Fertilization should be minimal, using a balanced fertilizer during the growing season, while pruning is best done in early spring to shape the plant and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with legumes can enhance soil nitrogen levels, supporting the acacia's growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acacia coriacea var. angustior is a hardy shrub that provides food and shelter for a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers and nectar. The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil and benefiting surrounding vegetation. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it serves as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, promoting biodiversity and sustainable land use.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acacia coriacea var. angustior is a versatile plant with a range of uses and applications.</p>
