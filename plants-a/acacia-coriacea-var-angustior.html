                        <h1>Acacia coriacea var. angustior</h1>
<p>Acacia coriacea var. angustior, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and narrow, dark green leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The species is often used in revegetation projects due to its resilience and ability to fix nitrogen.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia coriacea var. angustior is primarily native to northern Australia, including parts of Queensland and the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>This variant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. It thrives in open woodlands and shrublands, often growing in association with other drought-tolerant species. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native range, with a deep root system and thick foliage to conserve water.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia coriacea var. angustior was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the northern and western parts of the country. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber due to its hardy nature. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its invasive potential in certain environments.</p>
<p>However, it also plays a role in supporting local wildlife and providing habitat in degraded landscapes.</p>
