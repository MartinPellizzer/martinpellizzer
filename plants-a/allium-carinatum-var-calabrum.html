<p>Allium carinatum var. calabrum, commonly known as the Calabrian leek or wild leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs, which are smaller than those of regular leeks, are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky or woodland soils and is valued both for its culinary uses and ornamental appeal.</p>
