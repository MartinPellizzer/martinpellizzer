<p>It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and covered with a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Asplenium stuhlmannii is often found in shaded, humid environments where it can thrive without direct sunlight.</p>
