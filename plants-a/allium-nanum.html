                    <h1>Allium nanum</h1>
<p>Allium nanum, commonly known as the dwarf garlic or mountain garlic, is a small, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a cluster of small, white or pale purple flowers on a slender stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Allium nanum is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value and mild garlic scent.</p>
