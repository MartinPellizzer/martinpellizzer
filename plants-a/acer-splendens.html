<p>Acer splendens, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn brilliant shades of red, orange, and yellow during autumn. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>Acer splendens thrives in a variety of soil types and is adaptable to different light conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
