                <h1>Actephila thomsonii</h1>
<p>Actephila thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's actephila, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Actephila thomsonii is often found growing on rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila thomsonii has leaves that are opposite in arrangement, ovate in shape, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are white with five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that releases seeds through wind dispersal, and the seeds are tiny, dry, and have a slight appendage to aid in their spread.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila thomsonii is primarily native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the central and eastern regions of the country. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within the rainforest. It is often seen in the understory of dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within Madagascar's unique ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila thomsonii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along trails.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soil conditions. This plant is often found in the understory of forests or in grasslands where it can receive sufficient light. Its introduction has been documented in several regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by its preference for specific environmental conditions and competition with native vegetation.</p>
