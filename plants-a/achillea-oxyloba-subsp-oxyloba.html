                <h1>Achillea oxyloba subsp. oxyloba</h1>
<p>Achillea oxyloba subsp.</p>
<p>oxyloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features basal rosettes of linear, gray-green leaves and produces small, clustered white flowers.</p>
<p>The plant has a strong aromatic scent due to its high concentration of essential oils. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Its floral structure is typical of the Asteraceae family, with composite flower heads made up of numerous tiny florets.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea oxyloba subsp.</p>
<p>oxyloba has basal leaves that are lanceolate to linear, with a silvery-gray underside, arranged in a rosette, and ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length. The stem is upright, hairy, and reddish-brown, growing from the base and branching sparingly.</p>
<p>Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets and pale yellow disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing for vegetative propagation.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea oxyloba subsp.</p>
<p>oxyloba is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees, Alps, and Carpathian Mountains. Its current distribution includes parts of France, Italy, Spain, and Austria, though it is now rare and considered critically endangered in many of these areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, dry grasslands and open woodlands, often growing in well-drained soils. This subspecies typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea oxyloba subsp.</p>
<p>oxyloba is a perennial plant known for its ornamental value and hardiness. It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with the latter method being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. The plant has a typical biennial growth cycle, thriving in cool seasons and going dormant in summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring supports growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea oxyloba subsp.</p>
<p>oxyloba is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering shelter and habitat in its dense foliage.</p>
<p>This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic compounds. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea oxyloba subsp.</p>
<p>oxyloba is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Europe and Asia, known for its ornamental value in gardens and landscaping. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its essential oils may have potential in the fragrance and perfume industries.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, it has been used for its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties, though scientific validation remains limited. Culturally, it is sometimes associated with symbolism related to resilience and healing.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems also contributes to its economic value through biodiversity conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea oxyloba subsp.</p>
<p>oxyloba has several varieties that are valued for their ornamental qualities and adaptability to different garden conditions. Popular cultivars include 'Aurea' and 'Paprika', which are known for their vibrant yellow and orange foliage, respectively.</p>
<p>While there are few hybrids specifically developed for this subspecies, it is often crossed with other Achillea species to create new cultivars with enhanced traits. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in rocky soils and its long-lasting, daisy-like flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>This subspecies is a favorite among gardeners for its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal in perennial borders.</p>
