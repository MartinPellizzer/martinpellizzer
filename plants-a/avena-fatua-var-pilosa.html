                    <h1>Avena fatua var. pilosa</h1>
<p>Avena fatua var. pilosa, commonly known as hairy wild oat, is a perennial grass species characterized by its hairy stems and leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe but has been naturalized in many parts of the world, including North America. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, with small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in bracts and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in agricultural settings.</p>
