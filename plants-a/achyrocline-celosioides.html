                <h1>Achyrocline celosioides</h1>
<p>Achyrocline celosioides, commonly known as the sweet rocket, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pink to purple in color, and it produces small, spherical fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Achyrocline celosioides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline celosioides has simple, opposite leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 2-5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, hairy, and slightly woody, with a light green to brownish bark that develops a rough texture as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale blue, with five petals and a tubular corolla, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by small bees. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline celosioides is primarily native to Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the Andean regions of these South American countries. It thrives in humid, tropical, and subtropical climates at higher elevations. The species is often associated with rocky soils and mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Its natural distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of the Andes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline celosioides was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was first discovered in the late 19th century and has since spread throughout various regions of the island. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, pastures, and coastal areas. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it poses a significant threat to the local ecosystem and biodiversity.</p>
