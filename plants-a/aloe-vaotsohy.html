                    <h1>Aloe vaotsohy</h1>
<p>Aloe vaotsohy, commonly known as the Madagascar aloe, is a succulent plant native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain water in its arid environment. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is used in traditional medicine and skincare products.</p>
<p>Aloe vaotsohy is well adapted to survive in hot, dry climates with minimal water.</p>
