                <h1>Acinodendron mourae</h1>
<p>Acinodendron mourae, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant typically grows to a height of 20â€“30 meters and has compound leaves with opposite arrangement. Its flowers are small and clustered, often white or pale pink, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in many regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron mourae has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes rougher with age, growing in a climbing or shrub-like pattern. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron mourae is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, specifically countries such as Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, lowland forest areas and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and is not typically found in dense primary rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron mourae was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant spreads through seeds dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting management efforts to control its spread.</p>
