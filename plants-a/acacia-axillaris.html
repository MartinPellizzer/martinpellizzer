                        <h1>Acacia axillaris</h1>
<p>Acacia axillaris, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are arranged along the stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are typical of many acacia species. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Acacia axillaris plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various coastal wildlife.</p>
