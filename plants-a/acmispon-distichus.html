                <h1>Acmispon distichus</h1>
<p>Acmispon distichus, commonly known as the slender needlepod, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. Its seeds are enclosed in slender, two-lobed pods, which are adapted for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Acmispon distichus is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmispon distichus has leaves that are opposite in arrangement, ovate in shape, and typically range from 1 to 3 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, erect, and often branched, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with yellow petals and a distinct yellow center, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a slender legume that turns brown when mature, containing small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to thrive in sandy or disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon distichus is primarily native to Mexico Northwest.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of this area. The plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. It is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of the region.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of northern Mexico, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon distichus was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It was initially brought in for its potential as a forage crop for livestock due to its high nutritional value. The plant has since become naturalized in various habitats, including disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in dry conditions have contributed to its spread.</p>
<p>However, it is now considered a weed in some areas, posing challenges for agricultural and ecological management.</p>
