                        <h1>Acaena sericea var. sericella</h1>
<p>Acaena sericea var. sericella, commonly known as silverweed, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its densely hairy, silver-gray foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by burr-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a subject of ecological study.</p>
