                <h1>Actinea quinquesquamata</h1>
<p>Actinea quinquesquamata, commonly known as the five-armed sea star, is a marine echinoderm belonging to the class Asteroidea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its five distinct arms, each with a unique arrangement of radial plates and ambulacral grooves. The body is covered in a calcareous endoskeleton, providing structural support and protection. It inhabits shallow coastal waters and is often found in rocky substrates.</p>
<p>This species plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by controlling prey populations and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinea quinquesquamata has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 2â€“5 cm in length and arranged spirally along the stem. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly furrowed with age. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in early summer and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that disperses its seeds by wind after splitting open.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea quinquesquamata is primarily native to the southern United States, including parts of Texas, Louisiana, and Florida.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This species is commonly found in the southeastern region of the country, where the climate supports its growth in moist, acidic soils. It is often associated with areas that have high humidity and abundant water sources.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in these wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea quinquesquamata was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high soil moisture and partial shade. The plant spreads through its rhizomes, forming dense mats that can outcompete native vegetation. It has been reported in several regions of the United States, particularly in the southeastern states.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas, it is considered a potential weed in certain ecosystems.</p>
