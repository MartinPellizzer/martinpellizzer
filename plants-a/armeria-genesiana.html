<p>Armeria genesiana, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves and produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species.</p>
