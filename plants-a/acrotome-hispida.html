                <h1>Acrotome hispida</h1>
<p>Acrotome hispida, commonly known as the rough acrotome, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for gardeners in arid regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotome hispida has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a dull green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with short, stiff hairs, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to poor soil conditions and aiding in the plant's survival in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotome hispida is primarily native to Eswatini, Free State, KwaZulu-Natal, and Northern Provinces.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in these regions across southern Africa. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and rocky areas. The species is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its ecological significance in these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotome hispida was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since become established in various regions across the country. Although it is not considered a major invasive species, it has the potential to spread in certain ecological conditions. The plant is typically found in coastal and urban areas, where it thrives in disturbed soils and sunny environments.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the role of human activity in the dispersal of non-native species.</p>
