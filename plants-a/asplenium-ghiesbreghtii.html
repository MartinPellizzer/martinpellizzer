<p>Asplenium ghiesbreghtii, commonly known as the Ghiesbreght's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rock crevices or on the bark of trees. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium ghiesbreghtii is a rare species, native to specific regions in South America, and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
