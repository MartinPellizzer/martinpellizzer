                <h1>Acinodendron squamulosum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron squamulosum, commonly known as the scaly acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, scaly texture, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand prolonged drought conditions.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in pod-like fruits, which are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron squamulosum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, bark that is grayish-brown in color and exhibits a fissured texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron squamulosum is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within these regions. The plant is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing along riverbanks and in secondary vegetation. Its distribution is closely associated with areas that have rich biodiversity and undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its natural range has become increasingly fragmented in recent decades.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron squamulosum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions such as Hawaii, Guam, and the Mariana Islands.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. However, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
