                <h1>Acourtia palmeri</h1>
<p>Acourtia palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils in desert regions. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in the spring, and it has narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>Acourtia palmeri is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia palmeri has small, narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a smooth, slightly succulent texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and upright, with a greenish-gray bark that is smooth and somewhat woody. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green structures arranged in dense clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the arid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia palmeri is primarily native to Mexico Northwest.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of northern Mexico, particularly in the states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Durango, and Sinaloa. This plant thrives in rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and limestone habitats. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native range.</p>
<p>Acourtia palmeri is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia palmeri was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in desert environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. This plant is well adapted to arid conditions and can survive with minimal water. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
