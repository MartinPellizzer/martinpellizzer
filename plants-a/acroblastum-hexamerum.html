                <h1>Acroblastum hexamerum</h1>
<p>Acroblastum hexamerum, commonly known as the six-rayed acroblast, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of six rays or bracts that radiate from a central axis. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are compound and have a distinctive, finely divided structure that aids in light capture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Acroblastum hexamerum is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acroblastum hexamerum has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that exhibits a slight woody texture as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbel-like inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroblastum hexamerum is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in regions of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, coastal dunes, and disturbed soils. This plant is commonly found in areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. It is often associated with sandy or gravelly soils and can be seen in coastal scrub and chaparral ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroblastum hexamerum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and horticultural trade.</p>
<p>It thrives in disturbed soils and can quickly colonize areas with poor vegetation. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread via seeds make it an invasive species in non-native regions. It often outcompetes native plants for resources, leading to ecological imbalances.</p>
<p>Efforts to control its spread include manual removal and the use of herbicides in affected areas.</p>
