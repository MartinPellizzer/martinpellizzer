<p>Acroblastum hexamerum, commonly known as the six-rayed acroblast, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of six rays or bracts that radiate from a central axis. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are compound and have a distinctive, finely divided structure that aids in light capture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Acroblastum hexamerum is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health.</p>
