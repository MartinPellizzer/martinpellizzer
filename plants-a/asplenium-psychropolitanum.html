<p>Asplenium psychropolitanum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and elusive species of fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that appear almost ethereal, often giving the impression of being semi-transparent. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in dense tropical forests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Asplenium psychropolitanum is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection.</p>
