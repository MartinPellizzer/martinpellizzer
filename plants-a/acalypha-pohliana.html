<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse morphological features.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many species with unique adaptations such as specialized leaves and flowers. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse forms and some containing toxic compounds. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cupplant," characterized by their showy flowers and often hairy foliage.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha pohliana, a specific plant within the genus Acalypha that is native to certain regions and is recognized for its unique botanical features.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha pohliana is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with rainforests or secondary growth habitats. It is also present in parts of Malaysia and Indonesia, where it grows in shaded understory conditions.</p>
<p>Acalypha pohliana is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha pohliana was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscapes in countries such as Australia, the United States, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have led to its establishment in some natural habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in certain areas where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
