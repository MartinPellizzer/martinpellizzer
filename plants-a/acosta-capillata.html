                <h1>Acosta capillata</h1>
<p>Acosta capillata, commonly known as the slender acosta, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Acosta capillata is typically found in grasslands and open areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta capillata has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slightly hairy, and has a light green to grayish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in spike-like inflorescences, with pale blue to purple petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta capillata is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude environments, including mountainous areas and rocky slopes. This plant typically thrives in temperate climates with cool temperatures and moderate precipitation. It is often associated with grasslands and open habitats in the Andes.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, its distribution is relatively limited to these geographic areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta capillata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, pastures, and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. Its introduction has led to its spread in native grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
