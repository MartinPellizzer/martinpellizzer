                <h1>Acinodendron rugosum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron rugosum, commonly known as the rough acinodendron, is a member of the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its rough, bark-like texture and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing minute seeds. Native to tropical regions of Africa, it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron rugosum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a rough, hairy texture and a dark green upper surface that turns reddish underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically gray to brown in color, and it grows in a shrub-like form. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale yellow, with five petals and stamens, and they bloom during the dry season, likely relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by animals feeding on the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron rugosum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often in humid tropical climates. This plant thrives in shaded undergrowth and is typically associated with secondary growth forests. It is also present in parts of southern Thailand and western New Guinea.</p>
<p>Due to its limited geographic range, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron rugosum was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, quarries, and abandoned agricultural fields. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions make it a preferred choice for land rehabilitation projects.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential has raised concerns in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
