                <h1>Aegiphila trifida</h1>
<p>Aegiphila trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with three distinct lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila trifida has leaves that are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, with a lanceolate shape, alternate arrangement, and a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a rough, grayish-brown bark with a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soils it inhabits.</p>
