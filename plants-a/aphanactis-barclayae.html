                    <h1>Aphanactis barclayae</h1>
<p>Aphanactis barclayae, commonly known as the Barclay's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically pale green or white, with a distinctive, almost translucent appearance. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it requires a humid, shaded environment to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Aphanactis barclayae is considered critically endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws.</p>
