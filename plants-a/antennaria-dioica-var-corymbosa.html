                    <h1>Antennaria dioica var. corymbosa</h1>
<p>Antennaria dioica var. corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountain meadows.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a characteristic species of harsh, cold climates.</p>
