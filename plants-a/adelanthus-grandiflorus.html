                <h1>Adelanthus grandiflorus</h1>
<p>Adelanthus grandiflorus, commonly known as the grandiflorous stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. It grows in compact, low forms, often forming dense mats or small clumps.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil and minimal water.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelanthus grandiflorus has small, needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a leathery texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with yellow petals and a greenish center, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the arid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelanthus grandiflorus is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and parts of Baja California. This species typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in desert or semi-arid environments. It is commonly seen in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Adelanthus grandiflorus is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelanthus grandiflorus was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowers.</p>
<p>It has since been reported in parts of southern Europe, including Spain and Italy, where it has established populations in disturbed soils and rocky areas. The plant is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its rapid spread and potential ecological impact.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor and control its spread to prevent further invasion of native habitats.</p>
