<p>Adelanthus grandiflorus, commonly known as the grandiflorous stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. It grows in compact, low forms, often forming dense mats or small clumps.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil and minimal water.</p>
