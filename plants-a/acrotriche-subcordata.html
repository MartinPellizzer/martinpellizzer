<p>Acrotriche subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, succulent perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acrotriche subcordata is adapted to withstand extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient species in harsh desert environments.</p>
