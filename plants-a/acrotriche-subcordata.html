                <h1>Acrotriche subcordata</h1>
<p>Acrotriche subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, succulent perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acrotriche subcordata is adapted to withstand extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient species in harsh desert environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotriche subcordata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a subcordate base, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a dull green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in inflorescences, with a pale yellow to greenish color, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soils in which the plant thrives.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotriche subcordata is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater and Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and rocky habitats, particularly on the islands of Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing on cliffs or in sandy soils. It is also present in some regions of South America, such as Venezuela and Colombia.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotriche subcordata was mainly introduced to the eastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the southeastern coastal regions.</p>
<p>It was originally native to South America, specifically Brazil and Paraguay. This plant was introduced as an ornamental due to its attractive, succulent foliage and unique appearance. It has since become naturalized in some areas, thriving in sandy soils and coastal environments.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited compared to other invasive species in the region.</p>
