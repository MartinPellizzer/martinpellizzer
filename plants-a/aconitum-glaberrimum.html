                <h1>Aconitum glaberrimum</h1>
<p>Aconitum glaberrimum, commonly known as the glabrous aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with serrated edges, and are often covered in a fine, waxy coating.</p>
<p>Aconitum glaberrimum contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum glaberrimum has compound, doubly pinnate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, arranged alternately along the stem, with leaflets that are ovate to elliptic in shape and can reach up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and somewhat hollow, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, growing in a straight, unbranched pattern. Its flowers are showy, blue to violet in color, arranged in racemes, and consist of five petal-like sepals and two smaller petals, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and small size.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients and water in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum glaberrimum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This species is adapted to cold climates and is typically found at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its distribution is closely linked to the presence of well-drained soils and sufficient sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum glaberrimum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and horticultural trade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and moist environments, often near roadsides or in urban areas. This plant has adapted well to a variety of climates, allowing it to spread beyond its native range. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered a non-native species with limited ecological impact in most regions.</p>
