                    <h1>Arundo fera</h1>
<p>Arundo fera, commonly known as wild reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its flowering spikes produce small, greenish flowers that are clustered in panicles, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
<p>Arundo fera is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in basket-making and thatching.</p>
