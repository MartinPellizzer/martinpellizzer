                <h1>Achillea inundata</h1>
<p>Achillea inundata, commonly known as the water yarrow, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, spoon-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant thrives in moist or waterlogged soils, often found in marshes, streambanks, and other wet habitats. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Achillea inundata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea inundata has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, slightly hairy, and have a reddish-brown color, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets and brown disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea inundata is a flowering plant native to the western Himalayas, primarily found in regions of India and Nepal.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Achillea inundata is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea inundata is a hardy perennial plant known for its vibrant yellow flowers and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rootstock or by sowing seeds in early spring. The plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering occurring in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning after flowering help maintain its health and shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like rosemary or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
