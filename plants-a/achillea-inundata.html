                <h1>Achillea inundata</h1>
<p>Achillea inundata, commonly known as water yarrow, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and in marshy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability to waterlogged conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea inundata has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a serrated margin and a grayish-green color, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, herbaceous, and often have a slightly hairy texture, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk florets surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and colonize moist habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea inundata is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in parts of southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited, with populations primarily restricted to specific coastal areas in Spain and Portugal. It thrives in saline and coastal environments, often growing on dunes or in salt marshes. This species is typically found at low altitudes, usually below 100 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Achillea inundata is considered vulnerable, and its conservation status is of concern for botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea inundata is a hardy perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in the spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or slugs, which can be managed with organic controls.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like thyme or rosemary can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea inundata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both nectar and habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant in wetland ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a healthy ecological balance. It also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system, which stabilizes soil along water bodies.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea inundata contributes to the overall health of wetland environments by improving water quality and providing shelter for aquatic and terrestrial species.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea inundata is a plant that has limited known uses and applications due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements.</p>
<p>It is not commonly used in culinary applications, as it is not widely cultivated or consumed. In medicinal contexts, there is limited documented evidence of its use, though it may share properties with other members of the Asteraceae family. Industrially, it does not play a significant economic role, as it is not harvested for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in certain regions, though this is not well-documented in mainstream literature.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea inundata has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Pink Frost' and 'Silver Queen', which are appreciated for their fluffy, silvery foliage and delicate flowers. Hybrids of Achillea inundata are often developed to enhance traits such as flower color, plant size, and drought tolerance. These cultivars and hybrids play an important role in horticulture, particularly in landscaping and garden design.</p>
<p>Their versatility makes them a favored choice for both residential and commercial gardens.</p>
