                    <h1>Aniba simulans</h1>
<p>Aniba simulans, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces oval, dark blue berries that are edible but have a sharp, peppery taste. Its dense foliage and ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates make it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ecological impact.</p>
