                <h1>Acer orientale f. ovale</h1>
<p>Acer orientale f. ovale, commonly known as the oval-leaf maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically pale green and turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The foliage provides seasonal color changes, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer orientale f. ovale has ovate to elliptical leaves that are glossy green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem, with a size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, with a wind pollination method. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer orientale f. ovale is a rare and ornamental maple variety native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Turkey.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to cultivation in botanical gardens and private collections, as it is no longer found in the wild. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted natural habitat and rarity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to prevent further decline.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer orientale f. ovale is a striking ornamental maple known for its vibrant foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with cuttings offering a more reliable and faster method. The growth cycle of this plant involves a slow initial development, followed by a period of rapid growth in spring and summer, with dormancy occurring in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and annual pruning to shape the plant and remove dead wood are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its ornamental value and promote a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer orientale f. ovale is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and promoting the growth of other native species. Its dense canopy helps in erosion control by reducing soil runoff during heavy rains.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration, supporting overall environmental health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer orientale f. ovale is a decorative plant primarily valued for its ornamental use in gardens and landscapes due to its attractive foliage and unique growth form.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas in certain regions.
