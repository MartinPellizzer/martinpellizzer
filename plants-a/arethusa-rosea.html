<p>Arethusa rosea, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pinkish-purple pouch-like flower that resembles a slipper, with a distinctive central spur.

Its leaves are broad and oval, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>Arethusa rosea is considered endangered due to habitat loss and is protected in many states.</p>
