<p>Alchemilla vulgaris subsp.</p>
<p>acutiloba, commonly known as the sharp-lobed lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are sharply lobed, giving it its subspecific name.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
