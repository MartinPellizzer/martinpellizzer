<p>Adonanthe coerulea, commonly known as the blue hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or violet petals, which are unique among hibiscus species. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adonanthe coerulea blooms during the summer months, producing showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonanthe coerulea has alternate, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers.
