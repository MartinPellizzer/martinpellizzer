<p>Atriplex leucophylla, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, reflective hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant has small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent and often have a waxy coating, adaptations that help it survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Atriplex leucophylla is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
