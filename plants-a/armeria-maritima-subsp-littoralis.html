<p>Armeria maritima subsp.</p>
<p>littoralis, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes.</p>
