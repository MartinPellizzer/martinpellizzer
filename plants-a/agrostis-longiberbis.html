                    <h1>Agrostis longiberbis</h1>
<p>Agrostis longiberbis, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Agrostis longiberbis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining ecological balance in grassland ecosystems.</p>
