                <h1>Achillea cuneatiloba</h1>
<p>Achillea cuneatiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with a grayish-green hue. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties have been historically recognized, though it is less commonly cultivated than other yarrow species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea cuneatiloba has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a bluish-gray color, and are arranged in a rosette pattern, typically measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, slender, and covered with fine hairs, growing from the base to form a compact shrub. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea cuneatiloba is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in countries like Italy, France, and Spain.</p>
<p>Currently, it is found in similar alpine and subalpine habitats across these regions, though its distribution has become more restricted due to habitat loss. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and open grasslands, often growing in sunny environments. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and threats from habitat degradation, Achillea cuneatiloba is classified as a vulnerable species in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea cuneatiloba is a hardy perennial plant known for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the roots in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in mild climates and often entering dormancy during harsh winters.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and regular pruning to control its spread and encourage new growth are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot in poor conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or chamomile can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea cuneatiloba is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both food and shelter. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through shared resources. It also contributes to erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea cuneatiloba offers ecological benefits by promoting biodiversity and supporting a healthy ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea cuneatiloba is a lesser-known plant with limited documented uses in culinary or medicinal contexts.</p>
<p>It is primarily of interest in botanical research due to its unique morphological characteristics and potential ecological roles. While it may not have significant industrial or economic applications, it contributes to biodiversity in its native habitats. Its cultural or symbolic significance remains largely unexplored in traditional practices.</p>
<p>Further study is needed to fully understand its potential contributions across various fields.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea cuneatiloba has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Pink Beauty' and 'Snow White,' which are prized for their delicate, lace-like foliage and long-lasting blooms. Hybrid forms have been developed to enhance traits such as flower color, compact growth, and disease resistance. These plants are widely used in horticulture for their ability to thrive in sunny gardens and their contribution to biodiversity in landscape design.</p>
<p>Their versatility makes them a favored choice among gardeners and landscapers.</p>
