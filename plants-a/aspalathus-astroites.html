<p>Aspalathus astroites, commonly known as the silver cotyledon, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, silver-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes.</p>
