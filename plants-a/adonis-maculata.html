                <h1>Adonis maculata</h1>
<p>Adonis maculata, commonly known as the spotted crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are typically divided into lobes and produces showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive black spot at the base of each petal. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Adonis maculata is also known for its toxic properties, containing compounds that can be harmful to both humans and animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis maculata has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are dark green with a silvery underside, each leaflet being lance-shaped and measuring approximately 2-4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and reddish-brown in color, with a branching growth pattern that emerges from a short, thick rootstock. The flowers are showy, yellow with dark red to purple spots, and have five petals arranged in a radial symmetry, blooming in late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, helping the plant survive in dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis maculata is primarily native to the western United States, including parts of California, Nevada, and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is also found in some areas of Baja California, Mexico. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands, chaparral, and open woodlands. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in areas with full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Adonis maculata is commonly associated with the California Floristic Province, where it thrives in Mediterranean climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis maculata was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It was brought in for its ornamental value due to its showy, yellow flowers. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native plant species. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in open habitats.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
