<p>Acaena sarmentosa var. longiuscula, commonly known as the slender mat grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features small, spiny fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals. The plant has wiry, persistent stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, often with a bluish-gray coloration.</p>
<p>This species thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
