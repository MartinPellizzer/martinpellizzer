<p>Andrachne phyllanthoides, commonly known as the silverleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and covered in fine, white hairs that contribute to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Andrachne phyllanthoides is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
