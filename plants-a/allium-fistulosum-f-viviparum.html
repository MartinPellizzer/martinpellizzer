                    <h1>Allium fistulosum f. viviparum</h1>
<p>Allium fistulosum f. viviparum, commonly known as the garlic chive or Chinese chive, is a variant of the common garlic chive that exhibits vivipary, a rare reproductive trait where the seedlings develop while still attached to the parent plant.</p>
<p>This plant is a perennial herb native to Asia, characterized by its long, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible leaves and bulbs.</p>
<p>The viviparous nature of this variety makes it unique among allium species, as it can produce viable seedlings without the need for traditional seed germination.</p>
