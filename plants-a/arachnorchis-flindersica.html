<p>Arachnorchis flindersica, commonly known as the Flinders Island spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, slender sepals and petals that resemble the legs of a spider. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in coastal areas, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance, and bloom during the cooler months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
