                    <h1>Anaphrenium abyssinicum var. salicinum</h1>
<p>Anaphrenium abyssinicum var. salicinum, commonly known as the Abyssinian sandmat, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, ribbed leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments.</p>
