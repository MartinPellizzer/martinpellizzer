<p>Adonis fulgens, commonly known as the golden crowfoot, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces, and it produces striking yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its delicate, nodding flowers that bloom on tall, slender stems. Adonis fulgens thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>It is noted for its ornamental value and has been cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis fulgens has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, smooth, and slightly woody, with a reddish-brown color and a branching growth pattern that rises upright. Its flowers are showy, with bright yellow petals and a prominent central red stigma, blooming in early summer and pollinated primarily by bees. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their small size and light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis fulgens was mainly introduced to areas with suitable climate and soil conditions, particularly regions with well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It has been observed in various regions across the United States, especially in the western states. The plant is often found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, open fields, and along riverbanks.
