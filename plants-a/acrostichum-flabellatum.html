                <h1>Acrostichum flabellatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum flabellatum, commonly known as the broadleaf hibiscus, is a member of the Malvaceae family and is native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>The plant's foliage and flowers are often used in ornamental gardening due to their vibrant appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum flabellatum has large, feather-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with a bright green color and a smooth surface, arranged in a dense, upright rosette.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a creeping or climbing pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dark brown, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind when it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively along the ground.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum flabellatum is primarily native to the tropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangrove forests, and wetlands where it thrives in saline or brackish water conditions. This plant is also present in some islands of the Caribbean, such as the Bahamas and the Lesser Antilles. It prefers humid climates with well-drained soils and is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize shorelines.</p>
<p>Its native range extends from southern Florida through the Caribbean to northern South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum flabellatum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist environments such as swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. This plant is often found in disturbed sites, including urban and agricultural areas. Its introduction has been associated with human activities like land clearing and landscaping.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
