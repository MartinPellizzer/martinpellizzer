<p>Acrostichum lingua, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
