                <h1>Acrostichum lingua</h1>
<p>Acrostichum lingua, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lingua has large, elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a deep green color and a smooth, waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a dense, clumping form. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically yellow or green, which bloom in late summer and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lingua is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangrove swamps, and wetlands where it thrives in saline and brackish water conditions. This plant is well adapted to humid climates and often grows in dense stands along riverbanks and estuaries. Its distribution includes countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Acrostichum lingua plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lingua was mainly introduced to coastal areas and disturbed sites in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, riverbanks, and sandy soils where it thrives in humid conditions. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system and rapid growth rate. It has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential remains a concern in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
