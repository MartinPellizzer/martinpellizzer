                    <h1>Asplenium africanum</h1>
<p>Asplenium africanum, commonly known as the African spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern native to Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. Its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the leaves, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Asplenium africanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
