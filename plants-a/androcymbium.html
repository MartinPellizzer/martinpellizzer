                    <h1>Androcymbium</h1>
<p>Androcymbium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale green or white flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for nutrient absorption, making it a hemiparasitic species. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often resembling a ghostly or ethereal shape.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and endangered status, it is highly sought after in conservation efforts.</p>
