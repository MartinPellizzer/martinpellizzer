<p>Abies faxoniana, commonly known as the Faxon's fir, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of central China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil, often found in forested areas at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
