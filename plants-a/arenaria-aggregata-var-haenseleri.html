                    <h1>Arenaria aggregata var. haenseleri</h1>
<p>Arenaria aggregata var. haenseleri, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>It features small, pale green to blue-gray leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers are usually pink to purple, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems, and bloom in early spring. This variant is adapted to rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight in alpine and coastal regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions and ecological restoration projects.</p>
