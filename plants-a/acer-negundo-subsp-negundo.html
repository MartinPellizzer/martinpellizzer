                <h1>Acer negundo subsp. negundo</h1>
<p>Acer negundo subsp.</p>
<p>negundo, commonly known as the box elder, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, typically divided into three to seven leaflets, which are opposite in arrangement.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins during the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near rivers, wetlands, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>The species is relatively fast-growing and adaptable, making it a common sight in urban and rural landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer negundo subsp.</p>
<p>negundo has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to cordate in shape, with serrated margins, and range in size from 4 to 10 cm in length. The leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, turning yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and straight, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a rapid growth pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in cymes, which bloom in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two wings, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted for rapid growth in moist, disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer negundo subsp.</p>
<p>negundo is a fast-growing deciduous tree native to eastern North America, specifically the United States and Canada. While it was originally found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in open woodlands, its current distribution includes parts of Europe, Asia, and Australia due to human introduction.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is typically found at low to moderate altitudes, often near water sources. Although it is not considered threatened in its native range, it is classified as invasive in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its adaptability has led to its widespread presence in both natural and urban environments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer negundo subsp.</p>
<p>negundo is a fast-growing, deciduous tree known for its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and rapid establishment. It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or layering, with seedlings often showing quick growth under favorable conditions.</p>
<p>The tree has a typical temperate growth cycle, shedding its leaves in autumn and regrowing them in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants like legumes can improve soil fertility and support its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer negundo subsp.</p>
<p>negundo is a versatile deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, while its seeds are consumed by birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It acts as an effective erosion control plant due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil. The tree also serves as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing biodiversity and supporting ecological balance.</p>
<p>Its presence contributes to overall habitat structure and supports a wide range of ecological functions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer negundo subsp.</p>
<p>negundo is a versatile plant with a range of uses and applications. In culinary contexts, its young leaves can be consumed as a leafy green, though it is less commonly used in cooking compared to other maple species.</p>
<p>Medicinally, it has been traditionally used in some cultures for its potential diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, its wood is valued for its strength and durability, making it suitable for furniture and construction.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is often associated with resilience and adaptability, symbolizing endurance in various regions where it grows.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer negundo subsp.</p>
<p>negundo has several popular cultivars such as 'Autumn Flame' and 'Crimson King', which are favored for their vibrant fall colors and compact growth. It also has hybrids with other maple species, contributing to the diversity of ornamental maples in gardens.</p>
<p>These cultivars and hybrids are widely used in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various climates. They are particularly valued for their ability to thrive in urban environments.</p>
<p>Their horticultural importance lies in their role as decorative trees and shrubs in landscaping and public spaces.</p>
