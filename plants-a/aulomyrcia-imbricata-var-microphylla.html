The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
