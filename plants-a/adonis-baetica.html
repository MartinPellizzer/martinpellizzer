                <h1>Adonis baetica</h1>
<p>Adonis baetica, commonly known as the Spanish globeflower, is a perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, globe-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis baetica has alternate, basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and somewhat woody with a rough, grayish-brown bark, growing in a branching pattern. The flowers are bright yellow, with showy, cup-shaped structures composed of five petals, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the limestone soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis baetica is primarily native to the Iberian Peninsula, specifically southern Spain and parts of Portugal.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, including areas such as Andalusia and the Baetica region, which is where its name originates. This plant thrives in rocky soils and open habitats, often growing in mountainous or coastal areas. It is particularly associated with the Sierra de CÃ³rdoba and the Sierra de Almagrilla.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis baetica was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, showy flowers.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes across southern Europe, including Spain, Italy, and parts of France. However, its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have raised questions about its ecological impact.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, careful management is recommended to prevent it from outcompeting native flora.</p>
