<p>Anabasis pulcherrima, commonly known as the desert rose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, spiny leaves. Its leaves are typically small, narrow, and arranged oppositely along the stems.</p>
<p>Anabasis pulcherrima is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
