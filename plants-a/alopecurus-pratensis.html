<p>Alopecurus pratensis, commonly known as meadow foxtail, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and wetlands, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences with small, greenish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various insects and birds.</p>
