                    <h1>Agave serrata</h1>
<p>Agave serrata, commonly known as the narrowleaf agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The leaves have a serrated edge, giving the plant its scientific name, and are covered in a layer of wax to reduce water loss. It produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear clusters of white or pale green flowers.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
