<p>Aizoon theurkauffii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that thrives in hot, dry environments with well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Aizoon theurkauffii is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can tolerate periods of drought.</p>
