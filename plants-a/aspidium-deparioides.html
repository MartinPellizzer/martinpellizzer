<p>Aspidium deparioides, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lobed fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive, undulating margin. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches itself to submerged rocks or vegetation. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically near the base.</p>
<p>Aspidium deparioides plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
