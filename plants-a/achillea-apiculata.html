                <h1>Achillea apiculata</h1>
<p>Achillea apiculata, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its narrow, silver-gray leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers make it a distinctive and hardy perennial.</p>
<p>Achillea apiculata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea apiculata has leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, with a dull green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and somewhat hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of pale yellow ray florets and yellow disk florets, blooming in summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a cylindrical achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to the presence of a pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea apiculata is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean area, including countries like Spain, Italy, and Greece.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of southern Europe and has been introduced to other regions, though it is not widely cultivated. It thrives in open, sunny environments such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and woodland edges. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Achillea apiculata is considered to be of conservation concern, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea apiculata is a hardy perennial plant known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and bright yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that involves a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its compact form. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and attract beneficial pollinators.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea apiculata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other native species to enhance soil health and promote ecological balance. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea apiculata offers ecological benefits by supporting a wide range of organisms within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea apiculata is a flowering plant known for its medicinal properties, often used in traditional remedies to treat wounds and inflammation due to its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, some parts of the plant may be incorporated into local recipes in certain regions. Industrially, it contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitats, supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some communities, representing resilience and healing.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems highlights its importance in sustaining natural environments.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
