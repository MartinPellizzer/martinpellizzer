                    <h1>Avenula requienii</h1>
<p>Avenula requienii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada grass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, upright stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Avenula requienii thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of high-elevation ecosystems.</p>
