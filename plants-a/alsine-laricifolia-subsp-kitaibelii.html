<p>Alsine laricifolia subsp.</p>
<p>kitaibelii, commonly known as the silverleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, silver-gray leaves that reflect sunlight and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its succulent leaves are adapted to store water, making it well-suited for harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats.</p>
