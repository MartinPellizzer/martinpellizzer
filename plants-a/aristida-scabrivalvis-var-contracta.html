                    <h1>Aristida scabrivalvis var. contracta</h1>
<p>Aristida scabrivalvis var. contracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture. The plant produces small, spikelike inflorescences that bear tiny, three-awned spikelets, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a ornamental plant in dry landscapes.</p>
