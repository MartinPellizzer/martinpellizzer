<p>Astragalus hirsutus subsp.</p>
<p>alindanus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through its root nodules, making it valuable in soil enrichment. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands, where it contributes to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
