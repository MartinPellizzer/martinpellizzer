                        <h1>Acacia loxophylla var. nervosa</h1>
<p>Acacia loxophylla var. nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined acacia, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves with finely divided, narrow leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia loxophylla var. nervosa is primarily native to northern Australia, particularly in the tropical and subtropical regions of Queensland and the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>This variant is commonly found in open woodlands, savannas, and rocky outcrops where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is adapted to the hot, dry climate and can tolerate periodic drought conditions. The plant is also sometimes found in southern New Guinea, extending its native range into that region.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various native animals.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia loxophylla var. nervosa was mainly introduced to South Australia and parts of New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, sandy soils along coastal areas and inland regions. This plant is often used in revegetation projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for native wildlife. It has also been introduced to some regions of Victoria and the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by its preference for specific environmental conditions.</p>
