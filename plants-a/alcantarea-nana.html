                    <h1>Alcantarea nana</h1>
<p>Alcantarea nana, commonly known as the dwarf alcantara, is a compact, low-growing plant native to the coastal areas of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage composed of thick, waxy leaves that can store water. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
