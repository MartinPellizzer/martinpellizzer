                    <h1>Alisma natans</h1>
<p>Alisma natans, commonly known as floating arrowhead, is a water-loving plant native to wetlands and shallow waters across North America.</p>
<p>It has narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with roots submerged in the mud. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Alisma natans plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
