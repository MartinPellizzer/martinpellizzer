                    <h1>Adiantum trifoliatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum trifoliatum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that resemble the feathers of a bird, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum trifoliatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting.</p>
