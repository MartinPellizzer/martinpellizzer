                <h1>Aegilops loretii</h1>
<p>Aegilops loretii, commonly known as the Loretti's wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Aegilops loretii is often found in rocky or disturbed soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments.</p>
<p>Its seeds are adapted for dispersal by wind, contributing to its distribution across arid and semi-arid regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops loretii has leaves that are narrow, grass-like in appearance, with a parallel venation pattern, and they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and has a smooth, greenish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, pale green to brown florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a caryopsis, and the seeds are dispersed primarily by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in dry, disturbed soils.</p>
