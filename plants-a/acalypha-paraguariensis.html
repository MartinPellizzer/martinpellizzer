<p>Acalypha paraguariensis, commonly known as ñandú or ñandú bristle, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, and often colorful bracts that surround its small flowers. The plant thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and clustered.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha paraguariensis has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually 5–10 cm long, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, and a serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, somewhat woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with some branching. The small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green, with stamens longer than petals, and they bloom from late winter to early spring, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed schizocarp, releasing three triangular seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha paraguariensis is a flowering plant native to South America, specifically found in parts of Paraguay, Brazil, and Argentina.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes regions of the Amazon Basin and surrounding areas, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. This species prefers moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and riverbanks. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its habitat is threatened by deforestation and land conversion, which may impact its long-term survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
