                <h1>Adenanthera malayana</h1>
<p>Adenanthera malayana, commonly known as the Malayan burr bean, is a leguminous plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive pod-like fruits that contain small, hard seeds. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in open woodlands and disturbed soils. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment.</p>
<p>The seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthera malayana has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are cylindrical, smooth, and somewhat woody, with a pale brown bark that peels off in thin layers. Its flowers are small and clustered in racemes, featuring yellow petals and a prominent red stigma, blooming during the dry season and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a pod that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera malayana is primarily native to Borneo, Malaya, and Sumatera.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical rainforests of these regions. The plant thrives in humid and warm climates with well-drained soil. It is often seen growing in lowland areas and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its natural range is limited to Southeast Asia, particularly within the Indonesian archipelago.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera malayana was mainly introduced to South Africa as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, showy flowers.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in various regions, particularly in coastal areas and along roadsides. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, which has contributed to its spread. It is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its ecological impact, it remains popular for its aesthetic value in gardens.</p>
