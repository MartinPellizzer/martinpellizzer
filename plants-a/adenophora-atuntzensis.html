                <h1>Adenophora atuntzensis</h1>
<p>Adenophora atuntzensis, commonly known as the Korean bellflower, is a perennial herb native to Korea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched.</p>
<p>Adenophora atuntzensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora atuntzensis has basal leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and slightly woody with a grayish-brown bark that becomes more fibrous with age. Its flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in umbels, with pale blue to purple petals that bloom in late summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora atuntzensis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan, Hubei, and Hunan.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, often in areas with cool, moist climates. This species is adapted to the unique ecological conditions found in these regions, including well-drained soils and moderate temperatures. It is commonly found in alpine meadows and is part of the local flora in these mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora atuntzensis was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and full to partial sunlight. This plant is commonly spread through seed dispersal by wind and animals. It has been noted in several regions of China and has occasionally been introduced to neighboring countries.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely influenced by human activities and environmental conditions.</p>
