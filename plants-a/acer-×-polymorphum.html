<p>Acer × polymorphum, commonly known as the variable maple, is a hybrid deciduous tree resulting from the cross between *Acer saccharum* (sugar maple) and *Acer rubrum* (red maple).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variable leaf shape, which can range from oval to deeply lobed, depending on the parentage. The tree typically produces small, red or yellow flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more fissured with age.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in eastern North America, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
