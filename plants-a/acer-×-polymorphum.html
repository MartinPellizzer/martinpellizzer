                <h1>Acer × polymorphum</h1>
<p>Acer × polymorphum, commonly known as the Red Maple, is a hybrid species within the maple genus, native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in autumn, which makes it a popular ornamental tree. The plant typically grows to a height of 20–30 meters, with a broad, rounded canopy. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with finely toothed edges, and turn striking shades of red, orange, and yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, winged seeds called samaras, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer × polymorphum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5–8 cm in length, with a serrated margin and a vibrant green color during summer, turning yellow to orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and grows upright, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in upright panicles, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer × polymorphum is a hybrid maple species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China and Korea.</p>
<p>While it was originally found in specific high-altitude habitats, its current distribution includes cultivation in temperate regions worldwide. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often growing in forest understories. This species typically occurs at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its natural habitat faces threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer × polymorphum is a hybrid maple known for its vibrant autumn foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering more reliable results. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity within 5 to 10 years, and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun.</p>
<p>Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or ornamental grasses enhances its aesthetic appeal and supports a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer × polymorphum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring blossoms and supports birds and small mammals with its seeds and canopy. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil health and promoting the growth of other plant species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing habitat for a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer × polymorphum is a decorative tree known for its striking red and orange foliage, making it a popular choice in ornamental landscaping and urban forestry.</p>
<p>While it is not typically used in culinary applications, its aesthetic value contributes to the beauty of gardens and public spaces. In traditional medicine, it has been used in some cultures for its potential anti-inflammatory properties, though scientific validation is limited. The tree also plays a role in cultural symbolism, often representing autumn and the changing seasons in art and literature.</p>
<p>Economically, it supports the horticulture industry by being a sought-after ornamental species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer × polymorphum has a variety of cultivars that are highly valued for their unique leaf colors and growth habits, including 'Autumn Flame' and 'Sundance,' which are popular for their vibrant autumn displays.</p>
<p>It is also a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Acer ginnala and Acer negundo, contributing to its genetic diversity. These hybrids are known for their adaptability to different climates, making them a favored choice for landscaping. Horticulturally, Acer × polymorphum is important for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a range of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its cultivars and hybrids are widely used in gardens and public spaces, enhancing landscape diversity.</p>
