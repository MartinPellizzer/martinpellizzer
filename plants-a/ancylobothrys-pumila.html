<p>Ancylobothrys pumila, commonly known as the small-leafed bladderworts, is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habit.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it can capture small aquatic organisms using its specialized bladder-like structures. The plant has simple, often submerged or floating leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-white in color, and are borne in clusters.</p>
<p>Ancylobothrys pumila plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
