<p>Androcymbium irroratum, commonly known as the silver-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru, it thrives in high-altitude cloud forests. The plant is characterized by its delicate, silver-veined leaves and its unique, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. Its inflorescence consists of several showy, white to pale pink flowers with intricate patterns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Androcymbium irroratum is considered an endangered species, making it a subject of conservation interest.</p>
