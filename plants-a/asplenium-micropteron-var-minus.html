                    <h1>Asplenium micropteron var. minus</h1>
<p>Asplenium micropteron var. minus, commonly known as the small-leaf maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
