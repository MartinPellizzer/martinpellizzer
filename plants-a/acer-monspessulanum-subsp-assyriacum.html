                <h1>Acer monspessulanum subsp. assyriacum</h1>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>assyriacum, commonly known as the Assyrian maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive red or orange coloration during the autumn season.</p>
<p>The tree typically grows to a height of 10–15 meters and has smooth, light gray bark. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>assyriacum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and clustered in cymes, with greenish-yellow petals, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>assyriacum is a rare and relict species native to southern Iraq and parts of Turkey. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Zagros Mountains of Iran and the Kurdish region of northern Iraq.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, rocky, and limestone-rich environments, often growing in open woodlands or along stream banks. This subspecies is typically found at altitudes ranging from 800 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, it is classified as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts to prevent its extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>assyriacum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The tree grows slowly, reaching maturity over several decades, and thrives in temperate climates.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization should be light, and pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and encourage healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other native trees or shrubs can enhance its growth and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>assyriacum is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in hedgerows, enhancing biodiversity and supporting ecosystem stability. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along riverbanks and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological benefits of the habitat by offering habitat structure and promoting a balanced ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum subsp.</p>
<p>assyriacum is a rare and ornamental tree known for its distinctive copper-colored leaves and historical significance. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its aesthetic value makes it a popular choice in ornamental gardening and landscape design.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, it has been used in some cultures for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, it contributes to local biodiversity and supports ecological balance in its native habitats.</p>
