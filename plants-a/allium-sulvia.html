                    <h1>Allium sulvia</h1>
<p>Allium sulvia, commonly known as the purple garlic or wild garlic, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and clusters of small, purple flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures similar to garlic, though they are typically smaller and less pungent than those of Allium sativum. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Allium sulvia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>
