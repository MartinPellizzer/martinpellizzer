<p>Ariocarpus trigonus var. minor, commonly known as the "cactus mouse ear," is a rare and striking cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spiny, globular shape and small, fleshy leaves that are often mistaken for mouse ears. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise desolate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after by collectors and conservationists alike.</p>
