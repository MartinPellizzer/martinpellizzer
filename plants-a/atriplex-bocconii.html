<p>Atriplex bocconii, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to poor, saline soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Atriplex bocconii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
