                    <h1>Abies ferreana var. longibracteata</h1>
<p>Abies ferreana var. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are closely packed along its branches. The plant produces distinctive bracted cones, which are longer and more prominent than those of typical fir species, giving it its specific variety name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
