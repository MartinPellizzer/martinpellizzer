                    <h1>Allium incisum var. araxanum</h1>
<p>Allium incisum var. araxanum, commonly known as the Araxanum leek, is a rare botanical variant native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, making it a potential candidate for culinary use.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
