                            <h1>Aceras Longibracteatum Var. Gallica</h1>
<p>Galician bellflower, scientifically known as Aceras longibracteatum var. gallica, is a rare and beautiful flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Galicia in Spain. This variant of the bellflower is distinguished by its striking violet-blue petals and compact, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, coastal environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Atlantic climate. Despite its aesthetic appeal, the Galician bellflower is considered endangered due to habitat loss and human encroachment. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique botanical treasure for future generations.</p>
