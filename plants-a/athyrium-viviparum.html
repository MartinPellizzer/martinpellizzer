                    <h1>Athyrium viviparum</h1>
<p>Athyrium viviparum, commonly known as the creeping fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground and form dense mats. The plant has feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent, contributing to its unique appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its reproductive strategy involves the production of spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
