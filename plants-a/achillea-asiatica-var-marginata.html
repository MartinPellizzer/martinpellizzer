                <h1>Achillea asiatica var. marginata</h1>
<p>Achillea asiatica var. marginata, commonly known as the Asian yarrow, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The leaves are typically gray-green and finely divided, giving the plant a feathery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea asiatica var. marginata has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-gray color and a hairy texture, measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, herbaceous, and have a slightly rough texture, growing from the base to form a compact plant. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their small size and feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea asiatica var. marginata is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of western China and has been introduced to some regions in Europe and North America. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, and gravelly soils, often growing in open habitats like steppes and slopes. It typically occurs at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, it is listed as least concern by the IUCN, but its habitat is threatened by land-use changes and overgrazing.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea asiatica var. marginata is a hardy perennial known for its vibrant yellow flowers and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seeds sown in late summer. This plant has a long growing season, blooming from late spring to early autumn, with a dormant period in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilize it lightly in spring and prune spent flower stalks to encourage rebloom. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot if conditions are too moist.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea asiatica var. marginata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit offers shelter and habitat for small insects and birds, contributing to local biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its allelopathic properties. Additionally, its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>This plant also plays a role in improving soil health by attracting beneficial microorganisms that aid in nutrient cycling.</p>
