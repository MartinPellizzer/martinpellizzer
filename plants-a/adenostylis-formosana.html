<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family. The plant is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, erect stems and small, clustered inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, and it often grows in wet or marshy habitats.</p>
<p>Adenostylis formosana plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostylis formosana has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly glossy surface.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a brownish-gray color, exhibiting an erect growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostylis formosana is a rare and endemic plant species native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat is primarily found in the mountainous regions of central and southern Taiwan. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Adenostylis formosana is listed as critically endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenostylis formosana is a rare and ornamental plant native to Taiwan, known for its unique rosette structure and striking blue-green foliage.</p>
