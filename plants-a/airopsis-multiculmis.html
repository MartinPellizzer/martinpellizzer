<p>Airopsis multiculmis, commonly known as the many-branched sea whip, is a marine colonial organism belonging to the class Anthozoa.</p>
<p>It forms dense, branching structures that provide habitat for various marine species. The plant's body is composed of a central axis with multiple branches, each covered in tiny polyps. These polyps are responsible for filter feeding, capturing plankton from the water.</p>
<p>Airopsis multiculmis thrives in shallow, warm waters and is often found in coral reef environments.</p>
