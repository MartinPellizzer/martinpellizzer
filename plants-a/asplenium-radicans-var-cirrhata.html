                    <h1>Asplenium radicans var. cirrhata</h1>
<p>Asplenium radicans var. cirrhata, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground or climb over rocks and trees. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a dark green color and a slightly curled appearance. This variety is notable for its ability to form dense mats, often found in forest floors or on the bark of trees.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a common indicator species in humid, temperate regions.</p>
