                        <h1>Acacia californica</h1>
<p>Acacia californica, commonly known as the California acacia, is a shrub native to coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It features narrow, gray-green leaves that are trifoliate, with three small leaflets arranged along a central stem. The plant produces yellow, spherical flower clusters that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are often covered in a layer of white, waxy bloom, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Acacia californica is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant for coastal and Mediterranean climates.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia californica is primarily native to coastal regions of California and southern Oregon.</p>
<p>It thrives in a variety of habitats including coastal bluffs, grasslands, and chaparral. This plant is commonly found in areas with mild, wet winters and dry summers. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the western United States.</p>
<p>Acacia californica is an important species in its native ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia californica was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, open woodlands, and disturbed sites. The plant has adapted well to the local climate and soil conditions. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
