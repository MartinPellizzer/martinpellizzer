                    <h1>Acacia californica</h1>
<p>Acacia californica, commonly known as the California acacia, is a shrub native to coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It features narrow, gray-green leaves that are trifoliate, with three small leaflets arranged along a central stem. The plant produces yellow, spherical flower clusters that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are often covered in a layer of white, waxy bloom, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Acacia californica is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant for coastal and Mediterranean climates.</p>
