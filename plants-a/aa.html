<p>Aa, commonly known as the Hawaiian silversword, is a unique plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and striking, spiky flower heads. The plant thrives in the volcanic soils of Hawaii's high elevations, where it has adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It plays a significant role in the local ecosystem and is considered a symbol of the islands' natural heritage.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and invasive species, the silversword is also a conservation concern.</p>
