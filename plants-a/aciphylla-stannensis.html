                <h1>Aciphylla stannensis</h1>
<p>Aciphylla stannensis, commonly known as the Stann Creek aciphylla, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant features dense, silver-gray foliage that helps it conserve water in its arid habitat. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciphylla stannensis has small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, forming a dense rosette at the base of the plant, with a grayish-blue color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a dark brown, fibrous bark that grows upright from the ground. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and typically white or pale blue, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant to anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla stannensis is primarily native to New Zealand North and New Zealand South.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the alpine and subalpine regions of both the North and South Islands. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often growing in open habitats such as hill tops and ridges. Aciphylla stannensis is well adapted to the cold and harsh climate of New Zealand's highland areas.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in these environments, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla stannensis was mainly introduced to the data as a rare and endemic species found in the Stannard Range of South Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is typically found growing on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils, where it forms dense clumps. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and monitor its population.</p>
