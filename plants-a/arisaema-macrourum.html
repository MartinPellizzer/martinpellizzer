                    <h1>Arisaema macrourum</h1>
<p>Arisaema macrourum, commonly known as the long-tongued arisaema, is a striking member of the Araceae family native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and a distinctive, spadix-like inflorescence. The plant produces a unique, elongated spadix that is often covered in small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by the presence of a modified leaf called a spathe, which encloses the spadix.</p>
<p>Arisaema macrourum is typically found in moist, shaded environments and is valued in horticulture for its dramatic appearance.</p>
