<p>Acronia somnolenta, commonly known as the sleepy acronia, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid understory of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, waxy leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pale pink and white, which bloom at night. Its unique pollination mechanism involves nocturnal moths that are attracted to its scent and nectar.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Acronia somnolenta is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
