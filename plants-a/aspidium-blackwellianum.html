<p>Aspidium blackwellianum, commonly known as the Blackwell's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are typically borne on long, wiry stalks. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Aspidium blackwellianum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
