                <h1>Actinea ursina</h1>
<p>Actinea ursina, commonly known as the bear's buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae, which includes many showy and often toxic plants. The plant features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a central cluster of stamens, typical of the genus Actinea. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Actinea ursina thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinea ursina has leaves that are palmately lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. It produces small, white flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in early summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a cluster of small berries that turn red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea ursina is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern and central Europe, including parts of the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and forested areas, often growing in shaded, moist environments. This plant is commonly found in countries such as Romania, Slovakia, and Ukraine. It is well adapted to the cooler climates and nutrient-poor soils of these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to these specific habitats across Europe.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea ursina was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly during the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
<p>It was initially brought as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness. The plant has since spread into natural habitats, often thriving in disturbed soils and shaded areas. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains relatively localized compared to other invasive species.</p>
