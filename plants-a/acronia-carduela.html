                <h1>Acronia carduela</h1>
<p>Acronia carduela, commonly known as the Spanish thistle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in dry, rocky soils. The plant features a spiny, spherical stem with dense, silver-gray foliage. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters at the top of the plant.</p>
<p>Acronia carduela is known for its hardy nature and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia carduela has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color on top, contrasting with a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia carduela is primarily native to the Mediterranean Basin, including regions in southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky habitats such as scrublands and coastal areas. This plant thrives in sunny environments with well-drained soils. It is particularly associated with the Iberian Peninsula and parts of the Balearic Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in certain areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia carduela was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soil, making it adaptable to a variety of ecosystems. This plant is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, such as southern Europe and parts of North Africa. Its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native species, raising concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, Acronia carduela is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens and landscapes.</p>
