                    <h1>Airopsis lagascae</h1>
<p>Airopsis lagascae, commonly known as the glass sponge or sea sponges, is a marine organism that belongs to the phylum Porifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique skeletal structure composed of spicules made of silica. These spicules provide structural support and are responsible for its translucent, glass-like appearance. Airopsis lagascae typically inhabits shallow coastal waters and is often found in coral reefs.</p>
<p>Its simple body structure and filter-feeding mechanism make it an important part of marine ecosystems.</p>
