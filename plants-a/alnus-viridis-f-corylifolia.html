                    <h1>Alnus viridis f. corylifolia</h1>
<p>Alnus viridis f. corylifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically 5â€“10 cm in length, with a smooth or slightly hairy upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are typical of the Betulaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes nitrogen fixation through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria, enriching the soil for other plants.</p>
