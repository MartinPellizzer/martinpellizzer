                    <h1>Acacia cloncurrensis</h1>
<p>Acacia cloncurrensis, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure.</p>
<p>Acacia cloncurrensis is often used in coastal stabilization due to its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
