                    <h1>Acaulimalva steinbachii</h1>
<p>Acaulimalva steinbachii, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy stems and broad, woolly leaves. The plant produces showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and water-storing tissues.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems and a subject of study in plant adaptation.</p>
