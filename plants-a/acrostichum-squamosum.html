                <h1>Acrostichum squamosum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum squamosum, commonly known as the scaly fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a scaly appearance on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can spread to form dense mats.</p>
<p>Acrostichum squamosum is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum squamosum has large, broad, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stems are upright and woody, with a rough, scaly bark that becomes more fissured with age. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers that bloom in late spring, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after ripening in summer.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and anchor itself in wet, swampy environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum squamosum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangrove swamps, and along riverbanks where it thrives in humid, saline environments. This plant is particularly associated with the Caribbean islands, where it grows in wetland and brackish water habitats. It is also present in parts of Florida and along the Atlantic coast of the United States.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for specific ecological conditions, its distribution is limited to these warm, coastal regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum squamosum was mainly introduced to coastal and wetland areas where it can thrive in saline and waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in mangrove swamps and estuarine environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing shorelines. The plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to changes in local ecosystems, affecting biodiversity and habitat structure.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive nature, it is also valued for its ability to reduce erosion and provide habitat for certain wildlife species.</p>
