                <h1>Acrostichum alatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum alatum, commonly known as the broadleaf brake, is a perennial fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy areas or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>The plant's unique structure and adaptability make it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum alatum has large, feather-like leaves that are elongated, narrow, and arranged in a pinnate pattern, typically ranging from 1 to 3 meters in length and varying in color from dark green to a lighter green on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and upright, with a rough, fibrous bark that is usually brown in color, and it grows in a clumping pattern. The plant produces inconspicuous, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, blooming during the late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed drupe that contains one or two seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum alatum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangroves, and wetlands where it thrives in saline or brackish water conditions. This plant is also present in parts of the Caribbean, including the islands of the Greater and Lesser Antilles. It prefers sandy or muddy soils and is often associated with estuaries and tidal flats.</p>
<p>Its wide distribution along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts makes it a characteristic species of coastal ecosystems in the New World.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum alatum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and partial shade, such as along riverbanks and in wetlands. This plant has been introduced to parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its establishment in some native ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it has been introduced.</p>
