                <h1>Aegilops persica</h1>
<p>Aegilops persica, commonly known as Persian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is closely related to wheat and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Aegilops persica is also valued for its potential role in agricultural research due to its genetic relationship with cultivated wheat species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops persica has narrow, elongated leaves that are alternate in arrangement, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green bark that grows straight upward. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to white flowers, which bloom in early spring and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed spike that disperses its seeds by wind once matured.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or dry soils.</p>
