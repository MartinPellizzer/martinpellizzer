                <h1>Adenia rumicifolia</h1>
<p>Adenia rumicifolia, commonly known as the sour fig or African sour fig, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its hairy, often reddish stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by edible, fleshy fruits with a sour taste. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a distinctive, serrated appearance.</p>
<p>Adenia rumicifolia is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia rumicifolia has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a rough, pubescent texture and a dark green upper surface contrasting with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and they grow as shrubs or small trees. The flowers are large, showy, and clustered in panicles, featuring yellow petals and red stamens, blooming during the wet season and pollinated by birds and insects. The fruit is a fleshy, red drupe that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia rumicifolia is primarily native to Angola, Benin, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Gulf of Guinea Is., Ivory Coast, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sudan-South Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along riverbanks. Adenia rumicifolia is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its wide distribution reflects its adaptability to diverse ecological conditions within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia rumicifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and spreads rapidly through its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
