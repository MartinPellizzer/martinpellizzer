                <h1>Avenastrum umbrosum</h1>
<p>Avenastrum umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or brown and appear in late summer.</p>
<p>Avenastrum umbrosum is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
