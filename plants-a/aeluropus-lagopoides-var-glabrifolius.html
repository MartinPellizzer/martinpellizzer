<p>Aeluropus lagopoides var. glabrifolius, commonly known as the smooth-leaved saltbush, is a halophytic grass native to coastal and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant thrives in sandy or muddy soils with high salinity, often found in estuaries and tidal flats. Its flowering spikes are usually borne on short, upright stems, producing small, spikelet-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to coastal conditions, making it an important component of salt marsh ecosystems.</p>
