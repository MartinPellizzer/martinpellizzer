                <h1>Aconitum balcanicum</h1>
<p>Aconitum balcanicum, commonly known as Balkan aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed divisions, and the plant has a reputation for containing potent alkaloids.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum balcanicum has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a rough texture and a width of about 10â€“20 cm.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and usually dark purple or reddish-brown, growing in a single, unbranched pattern. The flowers are blue to violet, arranged in dense spike-like inflorescences, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies; they bloom in late summer. The fruit is a follicle that releases small, winged seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for storage and anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum balcanicum is primarily native to the Balkan Peninsula, including countries such as Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous regions and alpine environments, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. This species thrives in temperate climates and is typically associated with forested areas and rocky slopes. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited geographic range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in parts of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum balcanicum was mainly introduced to Europe through horticultural trade in the 19th century.</p>
<p>It was initially cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking blue-violet flowers. The plant has since been naturalized in several regions, particularly in the British Isles and parts of southern Europe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native flora and posing a risk to ecological balance.</p>
