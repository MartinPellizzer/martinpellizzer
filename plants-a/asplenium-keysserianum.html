<p>Asplenium keysserianum, commonly known as the Keyser's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of moss-like tissue. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Asplenium keysserianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
