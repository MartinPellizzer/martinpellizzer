                <h1>Actinocephalus ithyphyllus</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus ithyphyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the base of its stems, and it produces small, white or pale green flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis. Its berries are usually red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by supporting bird populations and contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus ithyphyllus has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus ithyphyllus is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the western and eastern regions of the country. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal areas. It is also present in parts of Namibia and Mozambique.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus ithyphyllus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is an invasive plant species that has spread rapidly in the region. This plant is known for its ability to outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological disruption. It thrives in disturbed soils and can colonize a variety of habitats.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
