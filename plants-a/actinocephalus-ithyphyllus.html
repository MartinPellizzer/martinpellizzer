                    <h1>Actinocephalus ithyphyllus</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus ithyphyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the base of its stems, and it produces small, white or pale green flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis. Its berries are usually red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by supporting bird populations and contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem.</p>
