<p>Angraecum megalorrhizum, commonly known as the giant root angraecum, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescence and large, showy white flowers with a distinctive purple throat. The plant possesses a robust root system that helps it thrive in its native habitat, which includes rocky and arid environments. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by moths, a relationship that highlights its adaptation to nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region.</p>
