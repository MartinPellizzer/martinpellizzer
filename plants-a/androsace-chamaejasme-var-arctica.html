                    <h1>Androsace chamaejasme var. arctica</h1>
<p>Androsace chamaejasme var. arctica, commonly known as Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, often clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with limited growing seasons.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of tundra and mountain ecosystems.</p>
