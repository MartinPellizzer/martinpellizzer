                    <h1>Alluaudia dumosa</h1>
<p>Alluaudia dumosa, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features small, spiny leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to minimize evaporation.</p>
<p>Alluaudia dumosa is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and resilience to harsh conditions.</p>
