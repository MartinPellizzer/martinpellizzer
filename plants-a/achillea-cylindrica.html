                <h1>Achillea cylindrica</h1>
<p>Achillea cylindrica, commonly known as narrowleaf yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, cylindrical stems and finely divided, gray-green leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in flat-topped clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties have been historically used for their anti-inflammatory and astringent qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea cylindrica has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-gray color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark, growing in a compact, low-growing pattern. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green composite flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea cylindrica is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and scattered, with populations primarily found in southern France, Spain, and possibly Turkey. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky soils and open grasslands, often growing in coastal or mountainous regions. This species typically occurs at altitudes ranging from sea level up to approximately 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Achillea cylindrica is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea cylindrica is a perennial plant known for its compact, spire-like flowers and drought-tolerant nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. The growth cycle involves a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal watering, preferring full sun. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper air circulation and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and attract beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea cylindrica is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts beneficial insects and wildlife, contributing to biodiversity in its habitat. This plant acts as a companion plant, often growing well alongside other flowering species to enhance garden diversity. Its dense growth habit helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers shelter and food for small insects and birds, playing a vital role in maintaining ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea cylindrica is a perennial plant known for its medicinal properties, often used in traditional remedies to treat ailments such as inflammation and skin conditions.</p>
<p>It has also been explored for its potential in industrial applications, particularly in the development of natural dyes and biodegradable materials. While not widely used in culinary practices, some cultures have incorporated it into herbal teas or infusions. Culturally, it has symbolic significance in various regions, often associated with healing and resilience.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems also makes it valuable for supporting biodiversity in natural habitats.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea cylindrica has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Himelblau' and 'Caucasica', which are known for their vibrant blue to purple flower heads and compact growth habit. Hybrids of Achillea cylindrica are often bred to enhance disease resistance and extend the flowering period. These plants are of significant horticultural importance due to their adaptability to various soil types and their ability to thrive in full sun.</p>
<p>They are widely used in gardens for their ornamental value and low maintenance requirements.</p>
