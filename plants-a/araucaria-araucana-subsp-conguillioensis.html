<p>Araucaria araucana subsp.</p>
<p>conguillioensis, commonly known as the Huilliche Araucaria, is a coniferous tree native to southern Chile and southwestern Argentina. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of needle-like leaves and its conical shape.</p>
<p>The species is closely related to the more widely known Araucaria araucana, but it exhibits distinct morphological and genetic differences. It thrives in temperate rainforests and is adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
