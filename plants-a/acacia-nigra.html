                        <h1>Acacia nigra</h1>
<p>Acacia nigra, commonly known as the black wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and long, slender phyllodes that are usually green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by flat, woody pods. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions.</p>
<p>Acacia nigra is also known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia nigra is primarily native to the southern regions of Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and parts of Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in savannah and woodland areas, particularly in regions with a dry climate. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or sandy landscapes. Acacia nigra is also present in some parts of southern Arabia, extending its native range slightly into the Middle East.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia nigra was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or loamy soils and a warm, temperate climate.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This plant is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites due to its adaptability. It has been introduced to several parts of the world, including Australia and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it a valuable plant for soil stabilization and reforestation efforts.</p>
