<p>Artemisia umbelliformis subsp.</p>
<p>eriantha, commonly known as the woolly golden aster, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flower clusters, or umbels, that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant adapted to harsh, semi-desert conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in xeriscapic gardens.</p>
