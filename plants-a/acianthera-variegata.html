                <h1>Acianthera variegata</h1>
<p>Acianthera variegata, commonly known as the variegated acianthera, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and strikingly colored flowers, which often display a mix of white, yellow, and green hues. The plant typically features lance-shaped leaves with a waxy texture, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It produces small, fragrant blossoms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Acianthera variegata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera variegata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color that often has a faintly variegated pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth texture and a light greenish-brown color, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with a delicate white or pale pink color, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera variegata is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the humid tropical regions of this area. The plant thrives in the dense forests and shaded understories of the region. It is often associated with rocky outcrops and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the specific microclimates of the southeastern Brazilian forests.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera variegata was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was primarily brought in through horticultural trade as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, colorful flowers. The distribution has expanded beyond its original introduction sites due to its adaptability to various soil types and climate conditions. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California.</p>
<p>However, its spread is still limited compared to other invasive species in the area.</p>
