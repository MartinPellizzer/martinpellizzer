                <h1>Acinos purpurascens</h1>
<p>Acinos purpurascens, commonly known as the purple mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces showy, purple to pinkish flower heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions makes it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos purpurascens has alternate, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color, with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and branched, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, pinkish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky and dry environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos purpurascens is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky, open habitats such as chaparral, grasslands, and coastal bluffs. This species thrives in dry, sunny environments with well-drained soils. It is often associated with coastal and inland mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Acinos purpurascens is also found in parts of Nevada and southern Oregon.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos purpurascens was mainly introduced to areas with dry, rocky soils and open habitats, such as mountain slopes and meadows.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high elevations and is often found in areas with limited soil nutrients. This plant is typically associated with the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada. Its introduction to new areas has been primarily through human activity, including seed dispersal by animals or wind.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it can establish itself in disturbed or degraded landscapes.</p>
