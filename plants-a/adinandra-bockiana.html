                <h1>Adinandra bockiana</h1>
<p>Adinandra bockiana, commonly known as the Bock's adenium, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweed and related plants. The plant is characterized by its thick, succulent stem and waxy leaves, adaptations that help it survive in arid environments. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow.</p>
<p>Adinandra bockiana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra bockiana has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a dark green color with a slightly glossy surface.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, with a rough, bark-like texture that is reddish-brown in color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra bockiana is primarily native to China South-Central, China Southeast, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This species is found in the mountainous regions of these areas, where it thrives in humid and subtropical climates. It is commonly associated with forest understory habitats, growing in shaded environments with well-drained soil. The plant is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage.</p>
<p>Its natural range reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecological conditions of Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra bockiana was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil, making it suitable for coastal and lowland regions. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and secondary forests. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including the movement of plants for ornamental or agricultural purposes.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native flora.</p>
