<p>Asplenium × bavaricum nothosubsp.</p>
<p>protoadulterinum, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium bavaricum and another related species. It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, featuring delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive dark green color and a glossy texture.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its fronds are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
