                <h1>Acridocarpus prasinus</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus prasinus, commonly known as the green sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale green bark and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits containing winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus prasinus has simple, alternate, lanceolate leaves that are bright green and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a smooth surface and slightly serrated edges.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly woody, and has a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in nutrient absorption and soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus prasinus is primarily native to Angola, Cabinda, DR Congo, Gabon, and Uganda.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical rainforests of these regions. It thrives in humid and warm climates with high rainfall. The species is commonly associated with lowland and montane forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse habitats of Central and Southern Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus prasinus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The species has since naturalized and is now found in various regions across the country. It is commonly grown in gardens and parks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily.</p>
