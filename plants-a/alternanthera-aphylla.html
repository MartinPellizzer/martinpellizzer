<p>Alternanthera aphylla, commonly known as the red-leaf iron plant, is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red or purple foliage, which becomes more vibrant in low light conditions. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, well-draining soil and is often grown as a decorative plant in water gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies primarily in its foliage rather than its flowers.</p>
