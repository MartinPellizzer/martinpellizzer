                        <h1>Acacia verricula</h1>
<p>Acacia verricula, commonly known as the dwarf acacia, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, feathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in winter, which are clustered in spherical heads and attract various pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are adapted for dispersal by animals or through fire.</p>
<p>Acacia verricula is well-suited to dry conditions and is often used in revegetation projects due to its hardy nature.</p>
