<p>Asclepias tunicata, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green stems and leaves, which provide a unique texture and appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism.</p>
<p>Asclepias tunicata is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, playing a vital role in supporting local ecosystems.</p>
