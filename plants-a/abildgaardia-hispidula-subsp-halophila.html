                        <h1>Abildgaardia hispidula subsp. halophila</h1>
<p>Abildgaardia hispidula subsp.</p>
<p>halophila, commonly known as the saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and erect, branching stems.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in coastal areas and saline soils, demonstrating high tolerance to salt stress. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish or reddish in color.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of ecological importance in stabilizing soils in arid and coastal regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abildgaardia hispidula subsp.</p>
<p>halophila is primarily native to coastal areas of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. It is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils along the Atlantic coastline.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in saline and arid environments, often growing in dunes or on rocky outcrops. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats that provide the necessary salt tolerance and drainage.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the coastal vegetation in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abildgaardia hispidula subsp.</p>
<p>halophila was mainly introduced to coastal and brackish water environments. It thrives in saline conditions and is commonly found in estuaries and tidal flats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used for stabilizing shorelines due to its salt tolerance. It has been introduced to several regions with similar coastal climates.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to areas where it can tolerate high salinity and fluctuating water levels.</p>
