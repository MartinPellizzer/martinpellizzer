                <h1>Adiantum gingkoides</h1>
<p>Adiantum gingkoides, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Adiantaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its rhizomes are short and produce a rosette of sterile fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum gingkoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum gingkoides has fern-like leaves that are finely divided, with a lace-like appearance, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure around 10â€“20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a delicate, papery texture. The stem is slender, upright, and slightly hairy, with a light brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures rather than true flowers, and it does not produce showy flowers or fruits.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum gingkoides is primarily native to Laos and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This fern species is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Adiantum gingkoides is often associated with humid climates and is typically found in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific regions within Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum gingkoides was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and high humidity, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forest understories and along stream banks in its native range. This plant has been introduced to several parts of the world, including North America and Europe, often as an ornamental species. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some non-native areas, though it is not considered invasive in most regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate fronds and adaptability, it is popular among gardeners seeking shade-tolerant plants.</p>
