                <h1>Acrostichum lepidoglossum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum lepidoglossum, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The fronds are composed of numerous small, lance-shaped pinnae, giving it a lush, feathery appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lepidoglossum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are broad and lance-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and sturdy, with a smooth, dark brown bark that grows in a clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind after maturing in the fall.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively through underground runners.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lepidoglossum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. This plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often associated with riparian zones. Its distribution extends from Mexico through parts of the Caribbean to northern Argentina.</p>
<p>It is also occasionally found in Southeast Asia, though this may be due to human introduction rather than natural range expansion.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lepidoglossum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments and is commonly found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. This plant is often associated with disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in such conditions. Its introduction has sometimes led to the displacement of native vegetation in certain regions.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some parts of the world.</p>
