                <h1>Acnistus sideroxyloides</h1>
<p>Acnistus sideroxyloides, commonly known as ironwood acnistus, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Acnistus sideroxyloides is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus sideroxyloides has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, while the underside is lighter in color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus sideroxyloides is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with humid climates and is often seen growing in secondary forests or disturbed habitats. Its distribution extends into parts of the Pacific Islands as well.</p>
<p>It is not native to Africa or the Americas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus sideroxyloides was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as an ornamental plant or for erosion control.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along streambanks. The plant spreads through its prolific seed production and can establish quickly in new environments. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
