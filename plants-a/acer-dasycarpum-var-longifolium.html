                <h1>Acer dasycarpum var. longifolium</h1>
<p>Acer dasycarpum var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, serrated leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, red or orange samaras that are distinctive in shape and color. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with suitable growing conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum var. longifolium has leaves that are elongated and ovate, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length; they are bright green in summer and turn yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a bushy growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum var. longifolium is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of central China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it is now also found in parts of northern Vietnam, likely due to human introduction. This plant thrives in temperate climates, growing in moist, well-drained soils within forested areas. It typically occurs at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered a vulnerable species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum var. longifolium is a slow-growing, deciduous tree known for its striking ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The tree follows a typical temperate growth cycle, shedding its leaves in autumn and entering dormancy during winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot under poor conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or ornamental grasses can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum var. longifolium is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil structure and supporting the growth of other native species. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in carbon sequestration, supporting overall climate regulation in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum var. longifolium is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use but is occasionally employed in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in industrial applications, its wood may be utilized in small-scale woodworking due to its durability. Culturally, it holds significance in certain regions of its native habitat, where it may be appreciated for its ornamental value. However, due to its rarity and limited research, its economic and medicinal applications remain underexplored.</p>
<p>Overall, its role is more ecological and aesthetic than practical in modern contexts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum var. longifolium has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, such as 'Aconitifolium' and 'Crimson King,' which showcase striking foliage colors.</p>
<p>It is also known to hybridize with other maple species, producing cultivars that exhibit a range of leaf shapes and colors. These hybrids often display enhanced cold hardiness and unique foliage patterns, making them attractive for horticultural use. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its ability to add visual interest to gardens with its vibrant autumn colors and distinctive leaves.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids are increasingly sought after by landscapers and gardeners for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
