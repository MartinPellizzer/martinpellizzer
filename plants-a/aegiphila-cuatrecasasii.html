                <h1>Aegiphila cuatrecasasii</h1>
<p>Aegiphila cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas' aegiphila, is a shrub native to the cloud forests of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila cuatrecasasii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that has a slight ridged texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white to pale pink petals, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in arid and rocky environments.</p>
