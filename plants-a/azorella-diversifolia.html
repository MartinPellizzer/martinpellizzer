<p>Azorella diversifolia, commonly known as the Andean cushion plant, is a perennial plant native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing cushions of foliage, which help it survive in harsh, cold, and windy conditions. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted for water storage in arid environments.</p>
<p>Azorella diversifolia is also known for its ability to form extensive mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat.</p>
