                <h1>Achillea multifida</h1>
<p>Achillea multifida, commonly known as yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features feathery, finely divided leaves and flat-topped clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its aromatic foliage, which contains compounds such as achilleine and volatile oils. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, also known as the daisy or sunflower family.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea multifida has compound, feathery leaves that are finely divided, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a gray-green color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and somewhat woody at the base, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more fibrous with age. The flowers are small, clustered in flat-topped umbels, with white to pale yellow petals and yellow centers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, allowing wind dispersal of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, enabling the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea multifida is primarily native to Bulgaria, NW.</p>
<p>Balkan Pen., and Turkey. It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of these areas.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It is well adapted to the temperate climate of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the southeastern parts of Europe.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea multifida was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, feathery foliage and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in various regions, particularly in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant's ability to thrive in a wide range of soil types and climates has contributed to its spread. However, it is considered invasive in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological impacts of non-native species in new environments.</p>
