                <h1>Achillea multifida</h1>
<p>Achillea multifida, commonly known as yard broom, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features wiry, branched stems and finely divided, feathery leaves. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in summer, forming dense clusters.</p>
<p>It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea multifida has leaves that are deeply lobed, with a feathery appearance, and are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically gray-green in color, with a rough, hairy texture, and they range in size from 5 to 15 centimeters in length. The stem is erect, hollow, and has a greenish-brown color, growing in a branching pattern. The flowers are yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, and bloom from late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea multifida is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is now widely distributed in temperate regions around the world, often as an introduced species. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as threatened, its introduction to new areas can sometimes lead to ecological concerns.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea multifida is a hardy, drought-tolerant perennial known for its feathery foliage and delicate white flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing established clumps in early spring or fall. The growth cycle involves a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea enhances its ornamental value and supports beneficial pollinators.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea multifida is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, which contribute to the overall health of the ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea multifida contributes to biodiversity by offering shelter and habitat for small insects and animals.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea multifida is a flowering plant known for its various uses and applications across different domains.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, it is occasionally used as a spice or flavoring agent due to its aromatic properties.
