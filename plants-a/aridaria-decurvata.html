                    <h1>Aridaria decurvata</h1>
<p>Aridaria decurvata, commonly known as the curled arid grass, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and narrow, curling leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, adapted to pollination by wind or limited insect activity. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Aridaria decurvata is well-suited to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
