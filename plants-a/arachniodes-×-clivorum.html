<p>Arachniodes × clivorum, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a hybrid plant that combines traits from its parent species, Arachniodes and Clivopus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that give it a distinctive, almost spider-web-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate regions of Asia. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of silvery hair, which contributes to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Arachniodes × clivorum is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
