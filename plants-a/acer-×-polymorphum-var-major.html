                <h1>Acer × polymorphum var. major</h1>
<p>Acer × polymorphum var. major, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental species. The tree typically grows to a height of 20–30 meters and has a broad, spreading crown. Its leaves are palmately lobed with serrated edges and turn striking shades of red, orange, and yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and reddish-brown when young, becoming more fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer × polymorphum var. major has palmately compound leaves that are ovate to triangular in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer × polymorphum var. major is a hybrid maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, particularly in areas of Sichuan and Hubei provinces.</p>
<p>While it was originally found in specific high-altitude environments, its current distribution is limited due to its rarity and limited natural habitat. It typically grows in temperate forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve this unique plant.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer × polymorphum var. major is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster and more reliable results. This tree grows slowly to medium speed, reaching maturity over several decades, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to shape the tree and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer × polymorphum var. major is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. This tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity through its interactions with other plant species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land and protecting water quality.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing habitat for a wide range of organisms.</p>
