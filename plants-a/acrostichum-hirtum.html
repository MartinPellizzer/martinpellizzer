                <h1>Acrostichum hirtum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum hirtum, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with a rough texture due to the dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Acrostichum hirtum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum hirtum has large, compound leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, and can reach up to 2 meters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, growing in a climbing or trailing manner. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, with greenish-white petals, blooming during the spring and summer months, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and anchor itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum hirtum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of rivers and lakes where there is abundant moisture. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with disturbed or flooded soils. Its native range includes countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in these habitats by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum hirtum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and moist soil conditions. The plant is often used in landscaping and restoration projects due to its hardy nature. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range due to human activity and climate change.</p>
