                    <h1>Athyrium × lobatocrenatum</h1>
<p>Athyrium × lobatocrenatum, commonly known as the hybrid lace fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Athyrium filix-femina and Athyrium crenatum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and shaded landscapes.</p>
