                    <h1>Atraphaxis seravschanica</h1>
<p>Atraphaxis seravschanica, commonly known as the Karakum sand thorn, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia, particularly found in the deserts of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>It is a shrub-like plant adapted to arid and saline environments, with small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it resilient to extreme drought conditions.</p>
<p>Atraphaxis seravschanica plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat.</p>
