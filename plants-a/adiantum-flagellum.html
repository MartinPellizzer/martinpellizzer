                <h1>Adiantum flagellum</h1>
<p>Adiantum flagellum, commonly known as the mottled maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, bi-lobed fronds that are typically a mix of green and silver hues, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with each leaflet being narrow and tapering.</p>
<p>Adiantum flagellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum flagellum has fern-like leaves that are bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem, and typically measure 15-30 cm in length, displaying a pale green to bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and slightly hairy, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows in a clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-yellow in color, appearing in early spring, and are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a globose, spore-bearing capsule that disperses spores through wind, and the roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum flagellum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forests and along streams. This fern is commonly found in the Himalayan foothills and parts of Southeast Asia. It prefers humid climates with well-drained soil and partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to these specific geographic areas where the climate supports its growth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum flagellum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>It is commonly associated with regions that have high humidity and moderate temperatures. This plant thrives in areas with rich, organic soil and consistent moisture levels. Its introduction has been observed in several regions beyond its native habitat, including parts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>Adiantum flagellum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its delicate, fern-like foliage.</p>
