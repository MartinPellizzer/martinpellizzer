                <h1>Achras chartacea</h1>
<p>Achras chartacea, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and produces a fruit that is botanically classified as a syncarp, formed from the fusion of multiple berries. The plant has a sturdy trunk with a thick, fibrous bark and can grow up to 20 meters in height. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically green or yellow, and it is dioecious, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants.</p>
<p>The fruit, which is rich in carbohydrates, is a vital food source in many island communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras chartacea has large, palmate leaves that are typically 30â€“60 cm in diameter, with a smooth, waxy surface and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and succulent, with a grayish-brown bark that is smooth and sometimes fissured, growing in a solitary, upright form. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a large, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the plant to store water and anchor it in arid soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras chartacea is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Amazon rainforest and other humid lowland areas. This plant thrives in warm, moist environments with rich soil. It is often seen growing in shaded undergrowth near rivers and in swampy areas.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat supports a wide variety of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras chartacea was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential economic use.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with warm climates, such as parts of Southeast Asia, the Caribbean, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is often cultivated for its large, spiky leaves and its ability to thrive in coastal environments. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is now considered a potential weed in some regions.</p>
