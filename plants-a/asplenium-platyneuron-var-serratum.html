                    <h1>Asplenium platyneuron var. serratum</h1>
<p>Asplenium platyneuron var. serratum, commonly known as the serrated shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its preferred habitat.</p>
