<p>Arenaria rostrata, commonly known as the rostrate sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of tiny white or pink flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. It is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where temperatures are low and the growing season is short.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
