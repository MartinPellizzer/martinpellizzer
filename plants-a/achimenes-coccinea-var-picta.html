<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range from red to orange and yellow, often with intricate patterns. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are glossy and arranged in whorls around the stems. It thrives in warm, humid environments and prefers well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners and florists alike.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes coccinea var. picta has heart-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they are typically 5â€“8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slightly woody at the base, and has a smooth, reddish-brown bark with a slightly hairy texture. The flowers are tubular with a vibrant red corolla, often with a contrasting yellow throat, and bloom from late spring to early autumn, primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and establish itself in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes coccinea var. picta is a striking ornamental plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>While it was originally found in the humid lowland forests of the Amazon Basin, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including Southeast Asia, Africa, and the United States. This species thrives in warm, moist environments with high humidity and partial to full shade. It typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 500 meters, in areas with rich, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as threatened, its wild populations are becoming less common due to habitat destruction and over-collection.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achimenes coccinea var. picta is a striking tropical plant known for its vibrant, showy flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant has a summer-growing cycle, thriving in warm, humid conditions and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and consistent watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to encourage branching and remove dead foliage are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but can be affected by aphids or powdery mildew if conditions are too damp.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or geraniums can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
