<p>Sea thrift, scientifically known as Armeria maritima var. splendens, is a hardy coastal plant that thrives in harsh, saline environments. With its dense clusters of pink or white flowers, it adds vibrant color to rocky shores and dunes. This variety is prized for its resilience and ability to withstand strong winds and salt spray. Native to the Atlantic coast of Europe and North America, it has become a popular choice for gardeners seeking durable landscaping plants. Its striking appearance and ecological benefits make it a valuable addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes.</p>
