                <h1>Aechmea pendulispica</h1>
<p>Aechmea pendulispica, commonly known as the hanging bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces long, pendulous inflorescences that bear vibrant, showy flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its foliage is thick and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Aechmea pendulispica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, indirect light conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea pendulispica has rosette-shaped leaves that are typically narrow, strap-like, and arranged in a compact circle, with a waxy, dark green color and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, instead having a short, thick base that resembles a pseudobulb, covered in a fibrous, rough-textured bark. Its flowers are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence, featuring showy, brightly colored bracts that range from yellow to red, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the air, typical of epiphytic growth.</p>
