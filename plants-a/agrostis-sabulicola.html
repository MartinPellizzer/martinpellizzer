                    <h1>Agrostis sabulicola</h1>
<p>Agrostis sabulicola, commonly known as beach grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal regions of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects.</p>
