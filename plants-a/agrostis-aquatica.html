                    <h1>Agrostis aquatica</h1>
<p>Agrostis aquatica, commonly known as watergrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, lakes, and riverbanks. The plant has slender, tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often coated with a fine layer of wax. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Agrostis aquatica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
