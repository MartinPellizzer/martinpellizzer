                <h1>Acer pseudoplatanus var. erythrocarpum</h1>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. erythrocarpum, commonly known as the red-fruited maple, is a variant of the common maple tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red or orange-red fruits, which differ from the typical green or brown samaras of the standard species. The leaves are usually palmately lobed, with a serrated margin, and exhibit a vibrant green color during the growing season. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This variety is less common in the wild and is primarily appreciated for its unique fruiting characteristics.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. erythrocarpum has palmate leaves that are typically 5-7 lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>The stems are straight and slender, with a smooth, light grey bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a red, spherical samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. erythrocarpum is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy, particularly in the Apennines.</p>
<p>While its original range was limited, it has been introduced to other parts of Europe, including the British Isles and parts of France, where it is now cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections. This variant thrives in temperate climates, typically found in moist, well-drained soils in mixed forests or along stream banks. It is generally found at altitudes between 600 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural occurrence and restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. erythrocarpum is a unique variant of the maple tree known for its striking red fruits and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The growth cycle includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil with regular watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. erythrocarpum is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The dense growth of the plant acts as a companion plant, offering protection to smaller plants in its vicinity. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it supports ecological benefits by improving soil structure and enhancing habitat diversity in forest edges and woodland areas.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. erythrocarpum is a lesser-known variant of the maple tree that has limited direct culinary use due to its small, bitter fruits.</p>
<p>While not widely used in traditional medicine, it may have potential in phytochemical research for its antioxidant properties. Its ornamental value contributes to its role in horticulture and landscape design, supporting the ornamental plant industry. Culturally, it is not as symbolically significant as other maple species, but it can be appreciated for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications are more ecological and horticultural than culinary or medicinal.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus var. erythrocarpum has several popular cultivars that are highly valued in horticulture, such as 'Crimson King' and 'Sutherlandii', known for their striking autumn foliage.</p>
<p>It also serves as a parent in various hybrids, including the widely cultivated 'Autumn Flame' and 'Crimson Sentinel', which combine the ornamental traits of different maple species. These hybrids often exhibit enhanced coloration and growth habits, making them desirable for landscaping. The variety's horticultural importance lies in its ability to contribute to the genetic diversity of ornamental maples.</p>
<p>Its unique characteristics make it a valuable addition to both public gardens and private collections.</p>
