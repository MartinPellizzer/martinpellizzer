<p>Athyrium iseanum, commonly known as the Japanese maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and have a graceful, arching appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are covered by a kidney-shaped indusium. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it requires careful cultivation to maintain its health and vigor.</p>
