                <h1>Abutilon ellipticum</h1>
<p>Abutilon ellipticum, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, lantern-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and blooms. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Abutilon ellipticum is also known for its hairy stems and its ability to produce seeds in abundance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon ellipticum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes rougher as the plant matures, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are showy, with five petals that are yellow or orange in color, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, aiding in water absorption and anchoring the plant in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon ellipticum is a flowering plant native to the island of Socotra, located in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely restricted to Socotra, although it has been introduced to some botanical gardens and collections in other parts of the world. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, typically growing in rocky soils and coastal areas. Abutilon ellipticum is found at altitudes ranging from sea level up to approximately 600 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon ellipticum is a fast-growing, ornamental shrub known for its showy, lantern-shaped flowers and fuzzy foliage.</p>
