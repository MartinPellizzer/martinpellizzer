                <h1>Adiantum odorum</h1>
<p>Adiantum odorum, commonly known as the fragrant maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its unique ability to emit a subtle fragrance has made it a subject of botanical interest.</p>
<p>Adiantum odorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and sensory qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum odorum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, arranged in a rosette pattern, and typically measure around 10-20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a vibrant green, turning coppery red in the autumn. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a smooth, light green bark that grows from the base upward. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, appearing in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, spore-bearing structure that disperses spores through wind, and the roots are fibrous and well-developed for anchoring and nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum odorum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Japan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments like forests and rocky crevices. This species thrives in humid climates and is often associated with mountainous areas. Its distribution extends to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Adiantum odorum is well adapted to grow in partial shade and requires consistent moisture in the soil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum odorum was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its delicate fronds and attractive appearance.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become established in various habitats across the country. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in forested areas and along stream banks. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has raised concerns due to its potential to invade native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species.</p>
