                        <h1>Acacia sieberi</h1>
<p>Acacia sieberi, commonly known as the Sieber's wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Acacia sieberi is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other parts of the world.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia sieberi is primarily native to eastern Australia, including regions such as Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open forests, woodlands, and rocky areas. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with sclerophyllous vegetation. It is also present in some parts of southern New Guinea.</p>
<p>Acacia sieberi is an important plant in the ecological systems of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia sieberi was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
<p>It was originally introduced for its ornamental value and as a source of fodder for livestock. However, its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation have led to ecological concerns. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is now considered a weed in many areas of its introduction.</p>
