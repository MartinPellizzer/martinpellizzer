                <h1>Acer sanguineum</h1>
<p>Acer sanguineum, commonly known as the maple or bloodtwig dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ornamental red stems that become more pronounced in winter, adding visual interest to gardens. The plant typically has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges. It produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries.</p>
<p>Acer sanguineum thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer sanguineum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length; they are bright green in summer and turn red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures, and it grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and clustered in cymes, with a greenish-white color, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a paired samara with winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, acidic soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer sanguineum is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, including countries such as Italy, France, and Spain.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited due to habitat loss and climate change. It thrives in temperate climates, often growing in rocky soils and at higher elevations. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and declining populations, Acer sanguineum is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer sanguineum is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant red bark and maple-like leaves, commonly cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining specific cultivar traits. The growth cycle of Acer sanguineum involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry spells but avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases, though aphids and scale insects may occasionally pose a threat.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or rosemary can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer sanguineum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its early spring blossoms attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local ecosystems. It acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing biodiversity and soil health. Additionally, its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing slopes.</p>
<p>This plant also contributes to nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil and promoting the growth of other plants in the surrounding area.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer sanguineum is a species of maple tree known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its flowers and young leaves can be used in some traditional dishes. In medicinal practices, it has been historically used to treat ailments such as fever and inflammation. Industrially, its wood is valued for its durability and is used in furniture and construction.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty, often featured in landscaping and as a symbol of local heritage.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer sanguineum has a variety of cultivars and hybrids that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Atrosanguineum' with its deep red foliage and 'Crimson King' known for its intense coppery leaves. Hybrids such as 'Autumnalis' and 'Aureum' have been developed to enhance color variation and growth habits. These varieties are highly valued in horticulture for their vibrant autumn displays and adaptability to different climates.</p>
<p>Their aesthetic appeal makes them a popular choice for gardens and urban landscapes.</p>
