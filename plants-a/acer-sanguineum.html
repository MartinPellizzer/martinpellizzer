                <h1>Acer sanguineum</h1>
<p>Acer sanguineum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow during autumn. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, often peeling in thin, papery strips.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer sanguineum has palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, clustered flowers in early spring, with red bracts that enclose yellowish-green flowers, pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer sanguineum is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of China, Kazakhstan, and the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to isolated populations in these high-altitude areas. It thrives in cool, temperate climates with well-drained soils, typically found in forested slopes and rocky outcrops. This species grows at elevations between 2,000 and 4,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural spread, Acer sanguineum is considered a vulnerable species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer sanguineum is a deciduous flowering maple known for its ornamental value and vibrant spring blooms.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining cultivar traits. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote new growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with companion plants like lavender or heather in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer sanguineum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy pink flowers in early spring. Its roots act as an effective erosion control plant, stabilizing soil along riverbanks and slopes. The tree also serves as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a range of ecological interactions.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem by improving soil quality and offering habitat for numerous organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer sanguineum is a decorative tree known for its striking red flowers and autumn foliage, making it popular in ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>While its berries are not commonly used in culinary applications, the tree's wood has been historically used for furniture and cabinetry due to its durability. In traditional medicine, parts of the plant have been used to treat ailments such as coughs and skin conditions. Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and renewal, often featured in landscape design and public spaces.</p>
<p>Economically, it contributes to the horticulture industry by providing aesthetic value in urban and garden settings.</p>

<p>Popular cultivars include 'Orange Glow' and 'Red Sunset', which are known for their striking autumn foliage. Hybrids of Acer sanguineum are often created to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and leaf coloration. These plants hold significant horticultural importance due to their ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>They are commonly used in gardens and landscapes for their vibrant seasonal displays.</p>
