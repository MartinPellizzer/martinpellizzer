<p>Axonopus argentinus var. glabripes, commonly known as the glabrous axonopus, is a low-growing perennial grass native to South America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically glabrous, or hairless, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover in ecological restoration projects.</p>
