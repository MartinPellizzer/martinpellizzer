<p>Arenaria oscensis, commonly known as the Osca sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in coastal and inland dunes. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Arenaria oscensis plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
