<p>Armeria pseudarmeria subsp.</p>
<p>allioides, commonly known as the garlic-like sea thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its aromatic, garlic-like scent, which is characteristic of the Alliaceae family.</p>
