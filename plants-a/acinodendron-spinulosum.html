                <h1>Acinodendron spinulosum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron spinulosum, commonly known as the spinulose acacia, is a small shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and pairs of opposite, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron spinulosum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with rough, spinous protrusions, and has a dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron spinulosum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with high rainfall. It is often associated with disturbed sites and can be found along riverbanks and forest edges.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within the Indo-Malayan biodiversity hotspot.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron spinulosum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity or natural disturbances.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas, grasslands, and along roadsides where it can establish quickly. Due to its adaptability, it has spread to several regions beyond its native range.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
