                <h1>Acosta varnensis</h1>
<p>Acosta varnensis, commonly known as the Varnes' acosta, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs.</p>
<p>Acosta varnensis is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in cooler, moist conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta varnensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid environment by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta varnensis is primarily native to the Andean region of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically between 2,500 and 4,000 meters above sea level. This plant is commonly found in mountainous areas with rocky soils and cool, temperate climates. It is often associated with cloud forests and paramo ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta varnensis was mainly introduced to the Pacific coast of South America, particularly in countries such as Peru, Chile, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal dunes and sandy soils along the shoreline. This plant has adapted well to the saline and windy conditions of its new habitat. Its introduction has been largely due to human activities, including coastal development and the spread of vegetation for dune stabilization.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native flora.</p>
