<p>Atriplex prostrata subsp.</p>
<p>triangularis, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It has succulent, triangular leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in saline soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes.</p>
