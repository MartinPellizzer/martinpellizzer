                <h1>Adhatoda sericea</h1>
<p>Adhatoda sericea, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its roots and leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>Adhatoda sericea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda sericea has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, with a smooth surface and a silvery-white underside, measuring approximately 3-6 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are clustered in terminal spikes, with small, tubular structures that are typically pale blue or purple, blooming from summer to autumn and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda sericea is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant is often associated with humid forests and is frequently seen in the undergrowth of evergreen forests. Its native range extends to parts of Africa, including Tanzania and Kenya, where it thrives in similar ecological conditions.</p>
<p>Adhatoda sericea is also present in some regions of southern China and the Indian subcontinent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda sericea was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Africa. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated in gardens and along water bodies. Its distribution has expanded due to human activity and trade, leading to its presence in several non-native areas.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is introduced.</p>
