                <h1>Adhatoda sericea</h1>
<p>Adhatoda sericea, commonly known as silverleaf adhatoda, is a flowering plant native to tropical and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its silvery-gray leaves covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in moist, shaded areas. Its leaves are aromatic and have been used in traditional medicine for their medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda sericea has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, woody, and covered with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white to pale blue petals, and bloom from July to September, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda sericea is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent, particularly India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is now found in parts of Southeast Asia, including Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia, as well as some regions of Africa. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along riverbanks. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Adhatoda sericea is currently listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, indicating it is not at immediate risk of extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda sericea is a hardy, fast-growing plant commonly used in traditional medicine and ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter method yielding faster results. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to encourage bushiness are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and improve growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adhatoda sericea is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The plant acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing the growth of neighboring crops. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing degraded lands.</p>
<p>Additionally, Adhatoda sericea plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility and supporting sustainable land use.</p>
