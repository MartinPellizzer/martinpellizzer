                    <h1>Athyrium lastii</h1>
<p>Athyrium lastii, commonly known as the Japanese male fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread gradually.</p>
<p>Athyrium lastii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
