                    <h1>Arthrosolen flavus</h1>
<p>Arthrosolen flavus, commonly known as the golden liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, flat, and often yellowish-green thalloid structure, which is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, relying instead on a specialized structure called a thallus for nutrient absorption. Arthrosolen flavus is often found growing on rocks or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and ability to thrive in low-nutrient environments make it an important indicator species for certain ecological conditions.</p>
