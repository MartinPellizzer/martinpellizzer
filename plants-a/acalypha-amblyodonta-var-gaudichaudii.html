<p>It is characterized by its velvety, deeply lobed leaves that range in color from deep green to reddish-brown, depending on the season and light exposure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often hidden among the foliage. Its growth habit is compact to spreading, making it suitable for both container and in-ground planting in warm climates.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant is valued for its aesthetic appeal in horticultural settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha amblyodonta var. gaudichaudii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5–10 cm long and 3–6 cm wide, with serrated edges. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with some branching. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with greenish-white petals and stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
