                <h1>Achillea × intermedia</h1>
<p>Achillea × intermedia, commonly known as York foggrass, is a hybrid perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble clouds, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm and features finely divided, gray-green leaves. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are yellow to orange and attract a variety of pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × intermedia has compound, deeply lobed leaves that are gray-green in color, with a rough texture and a slightly hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, slender, and somewhat hairy, with a pale green color and a growth pattern that is typically clumping or spreading. The flowers are flat-topped clusters (compound umbels) of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, capsule that contains tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × intermedia is a hybrid plant native to Europe, particularly found in southern and central regions such as France, Spain, and Italy.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends to parts of North Africa and the Middle East due to human introduction and cultivation. This plant thrives in open, sunny environments such as grasslands, meadows, and rocky slopes. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its conservation status is considered stable due to its adaptability and widespread presence in suitable habitats.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea × intermedia is a hardy perennial known for its showy, daisy-like flowers and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer, though division is more reliable for maintaining cultivar traits. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering occurring in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering that can lead to root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if conditions are too wet.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or coneflower can enhance garden aesthetics and support beneficial pollinators.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea × intermedia is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts beneficial insects and wildlife, contributing to biodiversity in its ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other flowering species to enhance overall garden health. Its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers shelter and foraging opportunities for small animals and insects.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea × intermedia is a hybrid plant known for its ornamental value and historical significance.</p>
<p>It has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. While not widely used in culinary applications, it is sometimes employed in herbal teas. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to the horticultural industry by providing ornamental plants for gardens and landscaping.</p>
<p>Culturally, it has symbolic meanings in various traditions, often associated with healing and protection.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
