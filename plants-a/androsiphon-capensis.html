                    <h1>Androsiphon capensis</h1>
<p>Androsiphon capensis, commonly known as the Cape tamarisk, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, blooming in late winter to early spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Androsiphon capensis is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
