                <h1>Acmella uliginosa</h1>
<p>Acmella uliginosa, commonly known as the marshmallow plant or bog bean, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, yellow-orange flowers that resemble small sunflowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and thrives in moist, acidic soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It is a herbaceous perennial that can grow up to 30 cm tall, with a dense root system that helps stabilize soil in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Acmella uliginosa is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in treating skin conditions and inflammation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella uliginosa has leaves that are typically oval to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, with a smooth texture. The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, yellow with a distinctive red center, and are arranged in clusters; they bloom from late spring to early summer and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, oval seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella uliginosa is primarily native to Bolivia, Brazil North, Brazil Northeast, Brazil Southeast, Brazil West-Central, Colombia, Dominican Republic, French Guiana, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Leeward Is., Panam√°, Suriname, Trinidad-Tobago, Venezuela, and Windward Is.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in wetland and marshy habitats across these regions. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in nutrient-poor soils. Acmella uliginosa is known for its bright yellow flowers and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its native range spans much of South America and the Caribbean.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella uliginosa was mainly introduced to regions across Southeast Asia, South Asia, and parts of Africa, including the Andaman Islands, Assam, Benin, Borneo, Burkina, Cambodia, Cameroon, Caroline Islands, Central African Republic, Chad, China Southeast, Congo, DR Congo, East Himalaya, Equatorial Guinea, Fiji, Gabon, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, India, Ivory Coast, Jawa, Kazan-retto, Malaya, Marshall Islands, Nansei-shoto, Nepal, New Guinea, Nigeria, Ogasawara-shoto, Philippines, Queensland, Samoa, Senegal, Sri Lanka, Sulawesi, Sumatera, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, and West Himalaya.</p>
<p>This distribution suggests that the plant has been widely introduced, likely as an ornamental or for medicinal purposes. It thrives in wetland and swampy environments, which are common in many of these regions. The plant's introduction may have occurred through human activity, including trade and horticultural practices.</p>
<p>Its presence in such a diverse range of locations highlights its adaptability and potential ecological impact.</p>
