                <h1>Acmella uliginosa</h1>
<p>Acmella uliginosa, commonly known as the swamp waterplantain, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette growth habit and showy yellow flowers. The plant thrives in marshy and aquatic habitats, often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for water gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella uliginosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth texture and a bright green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a slightly hairy surface and a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a creeping or upright pattern depending on the environment. Its flowers are small, yellow with a prominent central white spot, and are arranged in clusters; they bloom from late spring to early autumn and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in wet, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella uliginosa is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia, often as an introduced species. This plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, and prefers humid, shaded conditions. It typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Despite its wide distribution, it is considered a species of least concern in terms of conservation status.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmella uliginosa is a flowering plant known for its vibrant yellow flowers and is commonly grown as an ornamental in wetland areas.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or division, with seeds typically sown in spring after stratification. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often blooming within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-draining soil and requires consistent watering to maintain humidity. Regular fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season, along with light pruning to encourage bushier growth, helps maintain its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by fungal issues if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with water-loving plants like iris or cattails can enhance its growth in wet environments.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acmella uliginosa is a wetland plant that provides food and shelter for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its vibrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in wetland ecosystems, supporting biodiversity. It also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along water bodies.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil fertility.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acmella uliginosa is a flowering plant native to South America, known for its vibrant yellow flowers and unique properties.</p>
<p>It has culinary uses, particularly in traditional medicine and as a natural dye. In medicinal applications, it is valued for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, often used to treat skin conditions and pain. Industrially, its flowers are used in the production of natural pigments and as a source of bioactive compounds.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain indigenous communities, representing resilience and beauty in harsh environments.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acmella uliginosa has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Coral Beauty' and 'Fireball', known for their vibrant orange and red flowers. Hybrids have been developed to enhance color, bloom size, and disease resistance. These plants are important in horticulture for their ability to thrive in wet conditions and their use in water gardens and bog landscapes.</p>
<p>Their striking appearance makes them a popular choice among gardeners seeking unique foliage and floral displays.</p>
