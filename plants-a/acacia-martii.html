                        <h1>Acacia martii</h1>
<p>Acacia martii, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow to golden flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Acacia martii is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and fuelwood in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia martii is primarily native to the Horn of Africa, specifically Somalia and Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, growing in rocky soils and along dry riverbeds. This species is well adapted to hot, dry climates and can thrive in areas with low rainfall. It is often seen in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Acacia martii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing shelter for wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia martii was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures, such as parts of Africa, the Middle East, and Australia. This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological impacts, including competition with native species.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive potential in some areas, Acacia martii is valued for its role in afforestation and land rehabilitation projects.</p>
