                        <h1>Acacia martii</h1>
<p>Acacia martii, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow to golden flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Acacia martii is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and fuelwood in its native habitats.</p>
