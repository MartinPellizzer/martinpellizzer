                <h1>Acronia perryi</h1>
<p>Acronia perryi, commonly known as the Perry's acronia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a hairy texture.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Acronia perryi is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia perryi has leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and slightly hairy, with a pale greenish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, blooming in late spring and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia perryi is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and consistent moisture. It is often associated with coastal regions and is adapted to tolerate brackish water conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia perryi was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks. The plant has a spreading growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded significantly in the eastern United States over the past few decades.</p>
