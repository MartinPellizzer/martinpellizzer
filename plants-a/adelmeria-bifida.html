                <h1>Adelmeria bifida</h1>
<p>Adelmeria bifida, commonly known as the twinleaf manzanita, is a shrub native to California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive two-lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its fruits are small, woody capsules that split open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Adelmeria bifida is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal and chaparral environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelmeria bifida has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub with a compact form. Its flowers are showy, with five pink petals and a yellow center, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round berry that splits open to release bright red seeds, which are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant in well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelmeria bifida is primarily native to coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>It grows in rocky, well-drained soils along cliffs and slopes. This plant is commonly found in areas with mild, Mediterranean-type climates. It thrives in sunny exposures and is often associated with chaparral and coastal scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Adelmeria bifida is a rare and endangered species, with a limited geographic range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelmeria bifida was mainly introduced to California, where it has become established in certain coastal and inland areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the coast and in open, disturbed habitats. The plant is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through human activity, such as landscaping or accidental transport.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens.</p>
