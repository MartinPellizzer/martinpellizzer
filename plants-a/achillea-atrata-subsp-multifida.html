                <h1>Achillea atrata subsp. multifida</h1>
<p>Achillea atrata subsp.</p>
<p>multifida, commonly known as the dark yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features basal rosettes of dark green, velvety leaves that are finely divided and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat, clustered heads, which bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine and its ornamental value contribute to its cultivation in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea atrata subsp.</p>
<p>multifida has compound, feathery leaves that are gray-green in color, with a finely divided structure and a soft, hairy texture; the leaves are arranged alternately along the stems. The stems are upright, branching, and have a smooth, light green to grayish bark, growing in a clump-forming pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, white to pale pink, clustered in flat-topped umbels, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea atrata subsp.</p>
<p>multifida is a perennial herb native to the western Mediterranean region, particularly in southern France, Italy, and parts of Spain. While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited and fragmented, with populations found primarily in isolated areas of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>This species thrives in dry, rocky or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as slopes, meadows, and rocky outcrops. It typically grows at elevations between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this rare plant.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea atrata subsp.</p>
<p>multifida is a hardy perennial plant known for its feathery foliage and vibrant yellow flowers. It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a dormant growth cycle, becoming active in spring and blooming in late summer to early fall.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea atrata subsp.</p>
<p>multifida is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering both nectar and shelter in its dense foliage.</p>
<p>This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. Additionally, its deep root system helps with erosion control by stabilizing soil in sandy or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It also contributes to biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea atrata subsp.</p>
<p>multifida is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its attractive, fern-like foliage and purple flowers. It has limited culinary uses, as its leaves are not commonly consumed, though some traditional practices may involve its use in herbal teas.</p>
<p>In medicinal applications, it has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and supports pollinators, enhancing ecological balance.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in local traditions, though its symbolic roles are less documented compared to other members of the Asteraceae family.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea atrata subsp.</p>
<p>multifida has several popular cultivars such as 'Herman Muir' and 'Caucasica', which are prized for their dark green foliage and showy yellow flowers. It is also commonly hybridized with other Achillea species to create plants with enhanced hardiness and extended bloom periods.</p>
<p>These hybrids often exhibit improved disease resistance and a wider range of flower colors. Horticulturally, this subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its versatility makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and border plantings.</p>
