                <h1>Acianthera miqueliana</h1>
<p>Acianthera miqueliana, commonly known as the Miquel's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in a loose cluster. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera miqueliana has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth texture and a light brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in inflorescences, displaying a pale pink to white color, blooming during the summer months, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera miqueliana is primarily native to Brazil North, Brazil West-Central, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>This orchid species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in humid environments, often growing in forest understories or along riverbanks. The plant is known for its small, showy flowers and is part of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>Its distribution spans across several South American countries, reflecting its adaptability to diverse ecological conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera miqueliana was mainly introduced to the Greater Mekong region of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It was first documented in Vietnam and has since spread to neighboring countries such as Cambodia and Laos. The plant is commonly found in moist, shaded habitats within tropical forests. Its introduction is believed to be due to both natural dispersal and human activities.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
