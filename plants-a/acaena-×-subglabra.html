                <h1>Acaena × subglabra</h1>
<p>Acaena × subglabra, commonly known as the New Zealand spinach or the silverweed, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, fuzzy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that give way to fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acaena × subglabra has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically 2–5 cm long and 1–2 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, somewhat woody, and have a rough, fibrous bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom in spring; they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a spherical achene enclosed in a persistent, bristly calyx, and seeds are dispersed by wind due to the hairy structures on the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena × subglabra is a hybrid plant native to New Zealand, specifically found in the South Island.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes both its native range and areas where it has been introduced, particularly in regions with similar climates. It thrives in a variety of environments, including grasslands, shrublands, and rocky slopes. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its natural occurrence and limited spread, it is generally considered to be of low conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acaena × subglabra is a low-growing perennial plant known for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the roots in early spring. The growth cycle of this plant is slow, with dense foliage appearing in late spring and flowering in summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning is typically limited to removing dead or damaged foliage.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs, and it benefits from companion planting with herbs like thyme or rosemary.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acaena × subglabra is a low-growing shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local pollination networks. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting ecosystem resilience. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acaena × subglabra helps improve soil health by fixing nitrogen, benefiting surrounding vegetation.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acaena × subglabra is a hybrid shrub native to New Zealand, known for its small, edible berries that have been traditionally used in Māori cuisine.</p>
<p>The berries are often consumed fresh or cooked and are valued for their nutritional content, including high levels of antioxidants.
