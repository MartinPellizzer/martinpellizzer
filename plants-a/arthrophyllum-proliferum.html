<p>Arthrophyllum proliferum, commonly known as the clustered featherplant, is a unique member of the fern family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, delicate fronds that are typically green and covered in fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Arthrophyllum proliferum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of forest understories.</p>
