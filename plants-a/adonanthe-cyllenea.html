                <h1>Adonanthe cyllenea</h1>
<p>Adonanthe cyllenea, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a star-shaped pattern, which bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has long, narrow leaves that help it absorb moisture from the air, typical of its epiphytic growth habit. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media.</p>
<p>Adonanthe cyllenea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonanthe cyllenea has leaves that are elongated, lanceolate in shape, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonanthe cyllenea is primarily native to the eastern and southeastern United States, including states such as Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and parts of Alabama.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams. This species is also present in some areas of northern Mexico, where it grows in similar wetland environments. It is often associated with pine flatwoods and cypress swamps, where it forms part of the understory vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Adonanthe cyllenea is considered a rare and endangered plant in many parts of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonanthe cyllenea was mainly introduced to new habitats in the Mediterranean region due to its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in gardens and public spaces across southern Europe, particularly in countries like Spain, Italy, and Greece. The plant thrives in sunny locations with well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in some regions, raising concerns about its potential impact on native flora.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, efforts are being made to monitor its spread and manage its presence in sensitive ecosystems.</p>
