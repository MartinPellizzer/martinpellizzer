                <h1>Achras tchicomame</h1>
<p>Achras tchicomame, commonly known as the African oil palm, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that develop into woody fruits. The plant's fruit contains a high oil content, making it economically important for oil production. It thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and high yield, it is widely cultivated in various parts of Africa.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras tchicomame has large, palmately compound leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a broad, palm-like shape and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grayish-brown in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a large, spiny capsule that splits open to release smooth, black seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant anchor itself in poor soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras tchicomame is primarily native to Central America, specifically Belize and Guatemala.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in lowland areas with well-drained soil. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is known for its large, spiny fruits and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The species is also found in parts of northern South America, including parts of Venezuela and Colombia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras tchicomame was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions where its ornamental value is appreciated.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, and parts of Central America. The plant is often cultivated for its large, striking fruits and its ability to thrive in warm, humid environments. Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other parts of the world with similar climatic conditions.</p>
<p>However, its introduction outside its native range has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
