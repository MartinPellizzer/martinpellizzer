                <h1>Acrostichum aureonitens</h1>
<p>Acrostichum aureonitens, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, glossy, golden-yellow fronds that are highly ornamental. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with numerous pinnae that contribute to its lush appearance.</p>
<p>Acrostichum aureonitens is valued in horticulture for its striking color and ability to add a tropical flair to gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum aureonitens has large, pinnately compound leaves that are bright green and shiny, with a smooth texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat fibrous, with a light green to brownish bark that becomes rougher with age. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a dark brown, three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping it spread and establish in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum aureonitens is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangroves, and swampy environments where it thrives in moist, saline conditions. This plant is also present in parts of the Caribbean, including the islands of the Greater and Lesser Antilles. It prefers warm, humid climates and is often associated with brackish or freshwater wetlands.</p>
<p>Its native range includes countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and the Bahamas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum aureonitens was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in landscaping and restoration projects due to its rapid growth and dense foliage. The plant thrives in wet or poorly drained soils, making it suitable for swampy or marshy areas. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its introduction has had both beneficial and potentially harmful ecological impacts depending on the region.</p>
