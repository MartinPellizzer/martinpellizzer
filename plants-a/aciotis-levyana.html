<p>Aciotis levyana, commonly known as the Levantine dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in temperate climates. It produces yellow flowers that develop into fluffy seed heads, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Aciotis levyana is often found in grasslands and along the edges of woodlands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis levyana has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown color, growing upright and branching sparingly. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring tubular petals in shades of yellow and orange, blooming during the summer months, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in dry, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis levyana is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, specifically found in Cuba and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Greater Antilles, though it is now considered rare. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. This species is typically found at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 300 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Aciotis levyana is listed as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aciotis levyana is a flowering plant native to South America, known for its vibrant blooms and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. The growth cycle of Aciotis levyana typically spans several months, with flowering occurring in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and occasional pruning to maintain shape and encourage blooming are recommended. It is relatively pest and disease resistant but may occasionally face issues with aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>
