                <h1>Aciotis levyana</h1>
<p>Aciotis levyana, commonly known as the Levantine goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Aciotis levyana is often found in open areas such as slopes and gravelly soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis levyana has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a creeping growth pattern that often forms mats. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with tubular corollas in shades of yellow to orange, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis levyana is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil.</p>
<p>It is found in the Brazilian states of Pará, Amazonas, and Maranhão. This plant typically grows in humid, tropical lowland areas with rich soils. It is commonly associated with riverine forests and floodplain vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the northern regions of Brazil within the Amazon Basin.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis levyana was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southern states, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers.</p>
<p>It has since spread into natural habitats, becoming a potential invasive species in some regions. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns. Its introduction is often associated with horticultural trade and accidental dispersal through human activities.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor and control its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
