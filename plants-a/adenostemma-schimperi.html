                <h1>Adenostemma schimperi</h1>
<p>Adenostemma schimperi, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in cymes. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which is a common feature among plants in the milkweed family.</p>
<p>Adenostemma schimperi is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, thriving in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma schimperi has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and are usually green in color.</p>
<p>The stems are cylindrical, slightly hairy, and have a reddish-brown bark that peels off in thin layers. The flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, with tubular petals that are typically pink or purple, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma schimperi is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Mozambique.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands, open woodlands, and disturbed areas with well-drained soils. This plant thrives in regions with a tropical or subtropical climate and is often associated with dry to semi-arid environments. It is typically found at elevations ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Adenostemma schimperi is often used in traditional medicine and has ecological significance in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma schimperi was mainly introduced to new areas through human activities such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. This plant has become a common weed in regions where it has been introduced. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a challenging invasive species to control.</p>
<p>It is particularly prevalent in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
