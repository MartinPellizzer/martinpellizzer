                <h1>Adenogramma diffusa</h1>
<p>Adenogramma diffusa, commonly known as the yellow adenogramma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, opposite leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Adenogramma diffusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenogramma diffusa has alternate, simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually 2–5 cm long and 1–2 cm wide, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in terminal panicles, blooming from March to May, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or arid soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogramma diffusa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil, often growing along stream banks or in shaded undergrowth. It is also present in parts of India and Sri Lanka, where it is known for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Adenogramma diffusa is an evergreen shrub that plays a role in local ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogramma diffusa was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in ecological restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is often found in areas with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure. Its introduction has helped in rehabilitating arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to avoid becoming invasive in non-target habitats.</p>
