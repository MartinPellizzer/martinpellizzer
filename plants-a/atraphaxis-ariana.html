<p>Atraphaxis ariana, commonly known as the Armenian sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with small, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Atraphaxis ariana is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
