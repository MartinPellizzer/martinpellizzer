                    <h1>Aldama ovatifolia</h1>
<p>Aldama ovatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf aldama, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its woody stems are often branched and can grow up to several meters in height.</p>
<p>Aldama ovatifolia is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
