                <h1>Aconitum luparia</h1>
<p>Aconitum luparia, commonly known as the alpine aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed leaflets that are covered in a fine, waxy coating.</p>
<p>Aconitum luparia thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum luparia has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and upright, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, arranged in a raceme, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, black seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, tuberous, and serve as storage organs for nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum luparia is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe, including countries such as Austria, Germany, Italy, and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in rocky soils at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. This plant is commonly found in open meadows, grasslands, and forest edges within these regions. It is well adapted to the cooler climate and shorter growing season of its native environment.</p>
<p>Aconitum luparia is part of the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae) and is known for its striking blue to purple flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum luparia was mainly introduced to North America through human activities such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland and meadow habitats. The plant is often cultivated for its attractive blue or purple flowers, which bloom in the summer. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to prevent its overgrowth in native ecosystems.</p>
