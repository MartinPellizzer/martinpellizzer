                    <h1>Anthocercis gracilis</h1>
<p>Anthocercis gracilis, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of tiny, succulent leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in spring. Its root system is extensive and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Anthocercis gracilis is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
