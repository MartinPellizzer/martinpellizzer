                <h1>Achillea millefolium var. gigantea</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. gigantea, commonly known as giant yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of basal leaves that are finely divided and fern-like, with a grayish-green hue. The plant produces tall, upright stems topped with flat, clustered flower heads composed of small white to pinkish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental and ecological landscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. gigantea has large, feathery, finely divided leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 10 to 20 cm in length, with a pale green to grayish-white color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and somewhat woody at the base, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more fibrous with age. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk florets surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. gigantea is a variant of the yarrow plant known for its large, feathery leaves and yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Native to Europe, particularly the Mediterranean region, it has a long history of cultivation and naturalization. Currently, it is found in parts of North America, especially in the western United States, where it thrives in dry, sunny environments. It typically grows at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters, often in rocky soils or open grasslands.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as threatened, its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and limited natural range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. gigantea is a striking perennial known for its large, feathery foliage and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in spring and early summer with a dormant period in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding wet conditions to prevent root rot. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and vigor. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow enhances its beauty and benefits from their shared preference for full sun and well-drained soil.</p>
