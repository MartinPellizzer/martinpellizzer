                    <h1>Arenaria rosanoi var. subglabra</h1>
<p>Arenaria rosanoi var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple, typically in late spring to early summer. The leaves are succulent and often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, setting it apart from other Arenaria species.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats at high elevations.</p>
