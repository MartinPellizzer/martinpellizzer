                    <h1>Arceuthobium verticilliflorum</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium verticilliflorum, commonly known as the winter barren, is a parasitic plant that relies entirely on its host for survival.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, making it unable to perform photosynthesis. The plant typically attaches to the roots of woody hosts such as birch and alder, drawing nutrients and water from them. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually white or greenish and appear in late winter or early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized parasitic lifestyle, it plays a unique role in forest ecosystems.</p>
