                <h1>Achyranthes ferruginea</h1>
<p>Achyranthes ferruginea, commonly known as redroot sida, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its upright stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its roots are often reddish in color, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes ferruginea has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, cylindrical, and have a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spikes during the summer months, and they are likely pollinated by wind due to their structure. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, helping the plant anchor in moist soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes ferruginea is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Indonesia, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with moist, fertile soils. The plant thrives in open woodlands, grasslands, and along the edges of forests. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands and northern Australia.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to humid climates and is often found in lowland areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes ferruginea was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as a potential ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can spread rapidly through its seeds.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to increased management efforts to control its spread and protect local biodiversity.</p>
