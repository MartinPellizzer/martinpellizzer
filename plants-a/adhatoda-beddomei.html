                <h1>Adhatoda beddomei</h1>
<p>Adhatoda beddomei, commonly known as the Indian Trumpet or Beddome's Adhatoda, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to violet. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated by insects, making it an important species in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Adhatoda beddomei is also valued for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the plant used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda beddomei has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light brown color and a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are tubular, with a violet-blue color, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensively branched, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda beddomei is primarily native to the Indian subcontinent, particularly India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and riverine areas. This plant is commonly associated with humid climates and is often seen growing along the banks of streams and in dense undergrowth. It is also present in parts of Southeast Asia, including Bangladesh and Myanmar.</p>
<p>Adhatoda beddomei is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional medicine for various health purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda beddomei was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species and prevent soil erosion in degraded lands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, waste places, and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces make it effective for land rehabilitation.</p>
<p>However, its spread can sometimes lead to competition with native flora if not managed properly.</p>
