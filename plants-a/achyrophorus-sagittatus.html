                <h1>Achyrophorus sagittatus</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus sagittatus, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus sagittatus has elongated, arrow-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and spread out near the surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb moisture.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus sagittatus is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. This plant thrives in areas with rich, organic soil and is often associated with deciduous forests. It is particularly common in the Appalachian region and the eastern seaboard.</p>
<p>Its distribution extends into the Midwest, where it grows in similar habitat conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus sagittatus was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environments. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, arrow-shaped leaves. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range due to its adaptability and rapid growth rate.</p>
