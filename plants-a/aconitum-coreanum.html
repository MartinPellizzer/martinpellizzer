                <h1>Aconitum coreanum</h1>
<p>Aconitum coreanum, commonly known as Korean monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces striking blue to purple spurred flowers that bloom in late summer. It is known for its toxic alkaloids, which make it a potentially dangerous plant to handle.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is often cultivated in gardens with caution.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum coreanum has compound, doubly pinnate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a serrated edge, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and somewhat hairy, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, clustered in racemes, with five petal-like sepals and showy spurs, blooming in late summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, adapted for absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum coreanum is primarily native to China North-Central, Inner Mongolia, Korea, Manchuria, Mongolia, and Primorye.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in mountainous regions and forested areas within these regions. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The species is often associated with rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum coreanum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and along stream banks. The plant is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid spread and competitive nature. It was likely introduced through horticultural trade or accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its presence has raised concerns among local ecologists due to its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
