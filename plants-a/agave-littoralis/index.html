                            <h1>Agave Littoralis</h1>
<p>Agave littoralis is a striking succulent native to the coastal regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States. It thrives in arid and saline environments, making it a resilient plant well adapted to harsh conditions. Known for its tall, spire-like stems and clusters of blue-green leaves, it adds a unique aesthetic to gardens and landscapes. This plant is also valued for its ability to produce edible fruits and its role in traditional medicine. Due to its hardiness and beauty, Agave littoralis has become a popular choice for xeriscaping and coastal gardening.</p>
