                    <h1>Alchemilla kvarkushensis</h1>
<p>Alchemilla kvarkushensis, commonly known as the Kvarkush stonecrop, is a perennial plant native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the summer. The plant has serrated, basal leaves that are covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies.</p>
