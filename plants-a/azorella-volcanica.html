                    <h1>Azorella volcanica</h1>
<p>Azorella volcanica, commonly known as the volcanic azorella, is a species of cushion plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing structure composed of tightly packed stems and leaves. The plant is adapted to harsh, cold environments and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. It forms a mat-like growth that helps prevent soil erosion and provides habitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>Azorella volcanica is also known for its ability to store water, which allows it to thrive in arid and high-altitude conditions.</p>
