<p>Acmispon mearnsii var. equisolensis, commonly known as the coastal burr medic, is a perennial legume native to the coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by distinctive, spiny pods that contain small, edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers.</p>
<p>This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide forage for wildlife.</p>
