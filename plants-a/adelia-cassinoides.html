                <h1>Adelia cassinoides</h1>
<p>Adelia cassinoides, commonly known as the slender senna, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2â€“5 meters. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small leaflets that give it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Adelia cassinoides is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia cassinoides has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia cassinoides is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, including dunes and sandy soils near the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. This plant thrives in well-drained, sandy habitats and is often associated with maritime environments. It is an important component of the native flora in these regions, contributing to the ecological stability of coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia cassinoides was mainly introduced to coastal areas of southern Africa, particularly in South Africa and Mozambique.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found along the shoreline. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. It has been reported in several botanical gardens and private collections in the region.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited, and it does not appear to be invasive in natural ecosystems.</p>
