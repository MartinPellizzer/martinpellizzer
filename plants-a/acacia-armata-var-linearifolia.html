                        <h1>Acacia armata var. linearifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia armata var. linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It features slender, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance.</p>
<p>The species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia armata var. linearifolia is primarily native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Namib Desert and the succulent Karoo biome. This variety is adapted to extreme drought conditions and thrives in sandy or rocky soils. It is often seen growing along coastal areas and in inland dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays an important role in stabilizing desert landscapes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia armata var. linearifolia was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions. However, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
