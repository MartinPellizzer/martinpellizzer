<p>Asclepias giffordii, commonly known as the Gifford's milkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Asclepias giffordii is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential nourishment for both larvae and adult butterflies.</p>
<p>Its milkweed sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many herbivores but beneficial for the monarch's defense mechanisms.</p>
