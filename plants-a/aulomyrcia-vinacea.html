<p>Aulomyrcia vinacea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and rich reddish color. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by orange or red fruits containing winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Aulomyrcia vinacea is now considered an endangered species in its natural habitat.</p>
