                    <h1>Ancylogyne peruviana</h1>
<p>Ancylogyne peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones rather than flowers. The plant has a robust, unbranched trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and its leaves are pinnately compound, arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
