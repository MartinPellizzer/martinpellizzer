                    <h1>Acanthophyllum tenuifolium</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf jointvetch, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, narrow leaves adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native range.</p>
