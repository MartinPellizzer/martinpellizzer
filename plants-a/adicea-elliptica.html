                <h1>Adicea elliptica</h1>
<p>Adicea elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf adicea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats.</p>
<p>Adicea elliptica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea elliptica has elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length and 2-4 cm in width.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. The flowers are small, clustered in loose inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea elliptica is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments within lowland rainforests and along riverbanks. The plant is commonly found in the understory of dense vegetation, where it receives partial sunlight. It is also present in parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia, where it grows in similar habitats.</p>
<p>Adicea elliptica is often used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea elliptica was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as a potential ornamental plant due to its attractive leaves. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant spreads rapidly through its rhizomes, making it difficult to control.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its ecological impact.</p>
