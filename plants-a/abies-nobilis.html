                        <h1>Abies nobilis</h1>
<p>Abies nobilis, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pyramidal shape, dark green needles, and distinctive cone-like structures that hang from the branches. The tree typically grows in high elevation areas, preferring cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against environmental stressors.</p>
<p>The white fir plays an important role in forest ecosystems, offering habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies nobilis is primarily native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. This species thrives in high-altitude environments, typically in mountainous areas with cool, moist climates. It is commonly associated with coniferous forests and subalpine zones.</p>
<p>The plant's natural range extends into the Sierra Nevada and other mountain ranges in the western part of North America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies nobilis was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the western United States, particularly in California, Oregon, and Washington. This species thrives in high-altitude environments where temperatures are moderate and precipitation is abundant. Its introduction has been largely due to its ornamental value and ecological importance in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is also vulnerable to climate change and pests such as the mountain pine beetle.</p>
