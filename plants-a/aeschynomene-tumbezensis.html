                    <h1>Aeschynomene tumbezensis</h1>
<p>Aeschynomene tumbezensis, commonly known as the Tumbes false indigo, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in coastal regions of Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or coastal soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale blue or violet in color, and it is adapted to tolerate saline and drought conditions. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing coastal dunes and its potential for use in phytoremediation.</p>
