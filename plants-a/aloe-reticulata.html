                    <h1>Aloe reticulata</h1>
<p>Aloe reticulata, commonly known as the netted aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are ribbed and covered in a white, powdery coating called farina. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow or orange flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are often used for their medicinal properties, though it is not as widely used as other aloe species.</p>
<p>Aloe reticulata is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-draining soil and full sun.</p>
