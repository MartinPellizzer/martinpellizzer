                <h1>Acroceras gabunense</h1>
<p>Acroceras gabunense, commonly known as the Gabon sandwort, is a flowering plant native to Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, succulent appearance. The plant features small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acroceras gabunense has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and have a pale yellow color, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that contains small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroceras gabunense is primarily native to Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Congo, DR Congo, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Nigeria, Sudan-South Sudan, Togo, and Uganda.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forested areas. Its distribution is closely linked to the biodiversity of Central and West Africa.</p>
<p>Acroceras gabunense plays a role in the ecological systems of its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroceras gabunense was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with a temperate climate, particularly in the northern hemisphere. This plant thrives in environments where there is consistent moisture but not waterlogged conditions. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate a range of soil types.</p>
<p>Its introduction has been noted in several regions where it has adapted well to local conditions.</p>
