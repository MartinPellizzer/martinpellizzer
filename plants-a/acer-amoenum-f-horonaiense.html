                <h1>Acer amoenum f. horonaiense</h1>
<p>Acer amoenum f. horonaiense, commonly known as the Korean maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras with two winged seeds. It typically grows to a height of 8â€“15 meters and prefers well-drained soil in full sun.</p>
<p>This ornamental species is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer amoenum f. horonaiense has palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a bright green color during the growing season and a striking red or orange hue in autumn.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and upright with smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters during late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, a winged structure that allows for wind dispersal of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's natural habitat in forest understories.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer amoenum f. horonaiense is a rare maple species native to the Korean Peninsula, specifically found in the mountainous regions of South Korea.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations in the southern part of the country, particularly in the Gyeonggi and Gyeongnam provinces. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. It typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat fragmentation, Acer amoenum f. horonaiense is considered to be critically endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer amoenum f. horonaiense is a rare and ornamental maple tree known for its striking red foliage and compact size, making it a popular choice for small gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being the more reliable method for maintaining the desired varietal characteristics. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 5 to 10 years, and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Regular watering is necessary during the growing season, but it should be reduced in winter to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning in late winter helps maintain its shape and remove any diseased or dead branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its visual appeal and support a diverse ecosystem in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer amoenum f. horonaiense is a unique plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, aiding in the pollination of other plants in the ecosystem. This plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of neighboring species by improving soil conditions. Its deep root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil and preventing runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in enhancing habitat structure, offering refuge for small mammals and birds.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer amoenum f. horonaiense is a rare and ornamental tree native to Japan, known for its striking red leaves and unique floral structure.</p>
<p>While it is primarily cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and parks, it has limited culinary use as its fruits are not commonly consumed. In traditional medicine, it has been used in some regions for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Its cultural significance is evident in its role as a symbol of autumn and resilience in Japanese art and literature.</p>
<p>Economically, it contributes to the horticultural industry, supporting local markets and botanical research.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer amoenum f. horonaiense has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Baildon's Blood' and 'Crimson King', which display striking red foliage.</p>
<p>This variety is also used in horticultural breeding programs to develop new hybrids that enhance color, growth habits, and cold hardiness. Hybrids involving Acer amoenum f. horonaiense often combine the vibrant autumn colors of maples with the compact growth of other species. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to add seasonal interest to gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic appeal, it remains a sought-after plant among gardeners and landscapers.</p>
