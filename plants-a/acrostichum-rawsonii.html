                <h1>Acrostichum rawsonii</h1>
<p>Acrostichum rawsonii, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for over 100 years, making it a long-lived species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests.</p>
<p>The fronds are used in traditional MƒÅori crafts and the plant holds cultural significance in New Zealand.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum rawsonii has large, pinnately compound leaves that are usually broad and green, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically broad and elliptical in shape, with a smooth texture and a dark green color. The stem is upright and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows in a clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom during the summer and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum rawsonii is primarily native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia, including Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in mangrove swamps and tidal flats. This plant is well adapted to the high salt content and fluctuating water levels of its habitat. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various species.</p>
<p>Acrostichum rawsonii is a key component of the ecological diversity in these unique and dynamic ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum rawsonii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is an invasive plant species that has spread throughout various regions of the country. This distribution is largely due to its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in coastal areas and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
