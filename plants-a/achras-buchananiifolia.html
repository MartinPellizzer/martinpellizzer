                <h1>Achras buchananiifolia</h1>
<p>Achras buchananiifolia, commonly known as the white candelabra, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feather-like leaves. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters at the top of the stem. Its fruit is a large, spiny structure that contains edible seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras buchananiifolia has palmate leaves that are typically large, with a bright green color and a rough texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale grey bark that grows upward in a straight, unbranched pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellowish-white petals and a fragrant odor, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a fibrous, spiny capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted for absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras buchananiifolia is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans across the eastern coast of Brazil. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. It is often encountered in secondary forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its natural range includes parts of Paraguay and Argentina as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras buchananiifolia was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential use in agroforestry systems.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and parts of Central America. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils and is often cultivated in home gardens and botanical collections. Its introduction has been driven by its unique appearance and adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited due to its specific habitat requirements and relatively slow growth rate.</p>
