                <h1>Acer platanoides subvar. rubrum</h1>
<p>Acer platanoides subvar. rubrum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree produces small, red samaras that disperse its seeds by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer platanoides subvar. rubrum has large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically 10-15 cm in diameter, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and grayish-brown, with a straight growth pattern and a rough texture as it matures. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer platanoides subvar. rubrum is a variant of the Norway maple that is native to Europe, particularly in regions of the Balkans and parts of Central Europe.</p>
<p>While it was historically more widespread, its current distribution is limited, with populations found mainly in isolated areas of southern Europe. It thrives in temperate climates, preferring well-drained soils in woodland edges, along stream banks, and in open forest habitats. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural spread, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its former range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer platanoides subvar. rubrum is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring cold stratification for germination. The growth cycle involves rapid initial growth, followed by a slower maturation phase, with flowering occurring in early spring.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, preferring full sun to partial shade. Fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with perennials and shrubs in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer platanoides subvar. rubrum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's health. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers aesthetic value and can improve soil quality through nutrient cycling.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer platanoides subvar. rubrum is a decorative tree known for its ornamental value in landscaping and urban forestry due to its attractive foliage and stately appearance.</p>
<p>While not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in certain traditional herbal teas.
