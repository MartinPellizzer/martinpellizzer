                <h1>Actephila reticulata</h1>
<p>Actephila reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds with a distinctive network of veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila reticulata has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and has a light green to brownish color, with a growth pattern that is usually ascending or sprawling. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in axillary inflorescences, featuring five petals and stamens, and bloom from late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and wing-like structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila reticulata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in shaded environments, often growing under the canopy of dense forests. It is also present in parts of India and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to regions with a warm, humid climate and abundant rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila reticulata was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of the United States and Europe. The plant's ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its rapid growth rate contribute to its spread. It is often found in urban areas, along roadsides, and in abandoned fields.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in non-native environments.</p>
