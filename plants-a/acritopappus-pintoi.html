                <h1>Acritopappus pintoi</h1>
<p>Acritopappus pintoi, commonly known as the Hawaiian acanthus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features spiny leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in coastal and dry forest habitats, often growing on rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acritopappus pintoi has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with four petals, arranged in clusters, blooming during the spring season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, with the seeds being tiny and winged for easy aerial transport.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acritopappus pintoi is primarily native to Brazil Northeast.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the northeastern region of Brazil, where it thrives in specific ecological conditions. It is commonly associated with disturbed soils and open habitats in this area. The species is part of the Asteraceae family and is adapted to the tropical climate of the region.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely restricted to this geographic area within Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acritopappus pintoi was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used as a biocontrol agent due to its ability to feed on certain weeds. The plant is native to South America but has been introduced to several regions for its ecological benefits. It thrives in disturbed soils and can tolerate a range of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its introduction has helped reduce the spread of harmful weeds in managed landscapes.</p>
