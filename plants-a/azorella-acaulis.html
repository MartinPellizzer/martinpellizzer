                    <h1>Azorella acaulis</h1>
<p>Azorella acaulis, commonly known as the cushion plant or desert cushion, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Andes and Patagonia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, arid environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed to reduce water loss. Azorella acaulis produces yellow to orange flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude regions.</p>
