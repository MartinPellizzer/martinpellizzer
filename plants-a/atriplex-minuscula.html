                    <h1>Atriplex minuscula</h1>
<p>Atriplex minuscula, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration, adapting it to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, typical of the Ephedraceae family. Its salt tolerance allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Atriplex minuscula also serves as a food source for various wildlife, including birds and small mammals.</p>
