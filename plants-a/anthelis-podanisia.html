                    <h1>Anthelis podanisia</h1>
<p>Anthelis podanisia, commonly known as the red-flowered ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and its striking, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on aerial roots for attachment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Anthelis podanisia is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
