                <h1>Achillea michelii</h1>
<p>Achillea michelii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and flat-topped clusters of small white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and long blooming period make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its historical use in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea michelii has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, with a gray-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged in a rosette formation and typically measuring up to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, greenish-gray bark, and grows from the base of the plant, producing a single stem that branches slightly toward the top. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal, and the seeds are released in autumn.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea michelii is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, specifically found in southern France, Italy, and parts of Spain.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other areas, including North America, where it is now cultivated in gardens and naturalized in some regions. This plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and prefers sunny, well-drained environments, often growing in mountainous or coastal areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as threatened, its limited native range and potential for invasive spread in non-native areas have led to some conservation concerns.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea michelii is a hardy perennial plant known for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, division, or cuttings, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. The growth cycle of Achillea michelii typically involves a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering that can lead to root rot. Fertilization should be done in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions, making companion planting with marigolds or chives beneficial for natural pest control.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea michelii is a hardy perennial plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers, supporting local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. Additionally, its dense growth helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It also contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and supporting a diverse range of ecosystem interactions.</p>
