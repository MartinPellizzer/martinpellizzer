                <h1>Adenostemma hirtiflorum</h1>
<p>Adenostemma hirtiflorum, commonly known as hairy-flowered adenostemma, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an herb or shrub, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered with fine pubescence.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually pink to purple in color and are arranged in spikes, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma hirtiflorum has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dull green color on the upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat hairy, and has a grayish-brown bark that becomes rough with age, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are clustered in spikes, with tubular corollas that are pink to purple in color, blooming from summer to autumn, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma hirtiflorum is primarily native to Guatemala.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country. This plant typically grows in open areas such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is well adapted to the warm and humid climate of Central America.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely confined to Guatemala, where it thrives in diverse ecological conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma hirtiflorum was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in regions with a subtropical climate.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in states such as Florida, Texas, and California. This plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often associated with roadsides and agricultural areas. It has been reported as an invasive species in some parts of its range.</p>
