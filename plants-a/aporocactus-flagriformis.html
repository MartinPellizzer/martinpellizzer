<p>Aporocactus flagriformis, commonly known as the flame cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, sprawling cactus with thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its stems are covered in small, spiny tubercles that provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Aporocactus flagriformis is well-suited for xeriscaping and requires minimal water once established.</p>
