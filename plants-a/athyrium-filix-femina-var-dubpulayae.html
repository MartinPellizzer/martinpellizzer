<p>Athyrium filix-femina var. dubpulayae, commonly known as the lady fern, is a variant of the common lady fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous fern characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, humus-rich soil. It produces small, spore-bearing clusters on the underside of its fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and woodland settings.</p>
