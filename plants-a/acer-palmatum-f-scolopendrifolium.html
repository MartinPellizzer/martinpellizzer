<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum f. scolopendrifolium has leaves that are deeply lobed, with a maple-like shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are bright green in summer and turn vibrant red or orange in autumn. The stem is slender with a smooth, reddish-bark that becomes darker and more fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, clustered in panicles, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum f. scolopendrifolium is a variant of the Japanese maple known for its distinctive, finely serrated leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Japan, where it thrives in temperate climates. Currently, it is distributed in botanical gardens and horticultural collections worldwide, though it is not found in the wild. This plant prefers shady, moist environments such as forest understories and grows at altitudes between 600 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural occurrence and cultivation, it is considered a rare plant with a conservation status of vulnerable in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum f. scolopendrifolium is a compact, ornamental maple known for its delicate, lace-like foliage and vibrant seasonal color changes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-ripe cuttings in summer or by sowing seeds in early spring, though cuttings yield more consistent results. This plant grows slowly, reaching maturity over several years, with a growth cycle that includes active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it should not be overwatered. Fertilize with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring, and prune selectively to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or heathers can enhance its aesthetic appeal and create a harmonious garden setting.</p>
