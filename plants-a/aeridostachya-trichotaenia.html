                    <h1>Aeridostachya trichotaenia</h1>
<p>Aeridostachya trichotaenia, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed flame grass, is a perennial herb native to the grasslands of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy structures, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, red-orange inflorescences that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture that contributes to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
