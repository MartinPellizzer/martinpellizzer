                <h1>Acmella decumbens</h1>
<p>Acmella decumbens, commonly known as the spiny false sunflower, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas. The plant features showy yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive spiky center, which are attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Acmella decumbens is known for its ability to thrive in moist environments and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella decumbens has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is prostrate, with a woody texture and a reddish-brown bark, growing close to the ground. Its flowers are small, yellow with a distinctive orange center, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the dry season; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella decumbens is a flowering plant native to South America, primarily found in Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is now distributed across parts of Central and South America, with some populations introduced to tropical regions outside its native range. This species thrives in humid, tropical environments, often growing in shaded understorey areas of rainforests. It typically occurs at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as threatened, its habitat is under increasing pressure from deforestation, leading to concerns for its long-term survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmella decumbens is a tropical flowering plant known for its vibrant yellow flowers and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. The growth cycle of Acmella decumbens includes a dormant phase during dry seasons, followed by rapid growth and flowering during the wet season.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to encourage bushiness are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>
