                <h1>Acmella decumbens</h1>
<p>Acmella decumbens, commonly known as the spiny sunflower, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stems. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with a distinctive central disc, typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Acmella decumbens is adapted to grow in dry, sunny environments and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella decumbens has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring around 2-5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is prostrate, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that often lies close to the ground, forming a sprawling growth pattern. Its flowers are small, yellowish with a prominent central disk, and bloom from late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases small, elongated seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella decumbens is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Argentina Northwest, Argentina South, Brazil Northeast, Brazil South, Brazil Southeast, Brazil West-Central, Paraguay, and Uruguay.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It is commonly found in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The species is well adapted to the humid climate and nutrient-rich soils of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella decumbens was mainly introduced to Cape Provinces, Germany, KwaZulu-Natal, and New Jersey.</p>
<p>This plant is native to South America but has been spread to these regions through human activity. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in non-native regions.</p>
<p>The distribution highlights the impact of global trade and ecological connectivity on plant dispersal.</p>
