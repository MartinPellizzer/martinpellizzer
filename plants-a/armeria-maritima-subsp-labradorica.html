<p>Armeria maritima subsp.</p>
<p>labradorica, commonly known as the Labrador thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the coastal regions of Labrador and eastern Canada. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh maritime environments, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are linear and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in coastal landscaping.</p>
