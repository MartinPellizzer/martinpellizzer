                    <h1>Angraecum frommianum</h1>
<p>Angraecum frommianum, commonly known as the Fromm's star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender flower stems that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale blue flowers. The plant produces nectar-rich blossoms that are adapted for pollination by specific species of hawkmoths, which have evolved to access the deep nectar tubes. Angraecum frommianum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrate to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in greenhouses to ensure its survival.</p>
