                <h1>Acourtia macrocephala</h1>
<p>Acourtia macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces showy, daisy-like blooms that are typically pink to purple in color. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal and inland regions.</p>
<p>Acourtia macrocephala is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia macrocephala has leaves that are broadly ovate to rounded, with a smooth, waxy surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a pale green to brownish bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its flowers are showy, with large, showy yellow or orange petals arranged in a terminal inflorescence, blooming from spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia macrocephala is primarily native to Mexico Northeast and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in rocky soils and is often associated with scrubland ecosystems. The distribution includes parts of the states of Nuevo León, Coahuila, and San Luis Potosí.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia macrocephala was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, pastures, and disturbed forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and parts of California. Its introduction has led to its spread in native ecosystems, often competing with indigenous plant species.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common invasive species in some regions.</p>
