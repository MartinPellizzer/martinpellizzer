<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant is often found in dry, disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun. It has a strong, bitter scent due to the presence of essential oils, particularly thujone.</p>
<p>This variety is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a companion plant in gardens.</p>
