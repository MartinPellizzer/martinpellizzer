                    <h1>Ananas sativus f. typicus</h1>
<p>Ananas sativus f. typicus, commonly known as the common pineapple, is a tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial with a rosette of fleshy, spathaceous leaves that form a crown around the base. The plant produces a terminal flower spike that develops into a multiple-fruit, or syncarp, composed of many fused berries. The leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>This species is widely cultivated for its edible fruit, which is rich in bromelain and has a distinctive sweet-tart flavor.</p>
