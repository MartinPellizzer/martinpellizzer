                    <h1>Abies cilicica var. borisii-regis</h1>
<p>Abies cilicica var. borisii-regis, commonly known as the Bosnian fir, is a rare and relict species native to the high mountain regions of the Dinaric Alps.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its conical shape, dark green needles, and distinctive, often drooping cones. This variety is closely related to the common fir but exhibits unique morphological features adapted to its alpine environment. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils, typically at elevations above 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss.</p>
