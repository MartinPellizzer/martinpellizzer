                <h1>Adhatoda sulcata</h1>
<p>Adhatoda sulcata, commonly known as the wavy-leaved adhatoda, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive wavy or corrugated leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or wetland areas.</p>
<p>Adhatoda sulcata is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its bronchodilatory effects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda sulcata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly woody, with a rough texture and a reddish-brown bark that peels off in thin layers. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white in color, with five petals and a tubular corolla, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda sulcata is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent, particularly found in regions of India, Nepal, and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Currently, it is also distributed in parts of Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Malaysia. It thrives in moist, tropical environments such as forests and shrublands. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited research, its conservation status is currently listed as vulnerable.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda sulcata is a fast-growing, ornamental plant commonly cultivated for its attractive foliage and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter method being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of Adhatoda sulcata is typically seasonal, with active growth during spring and summer, followed by a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and occasional pruning to shape the plant and encourage new growth are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but can be affected by aphids and fungal issues in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like basil or marigold can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adhatoda sulcata is a plant that provides food and shelter for various species, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, aiding in the reproduction of both itself and other nearby plants. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through shared nutrients and pest deterrence. Its dense foliage helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along riverbanks and slopes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in improving soil health by acting as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the surrounding environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
