<p>It features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has delicate, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread across shallow water areas, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to aquatic conditions, with specialized structures that aid in buoyancy and nutrient absorption.</p>
