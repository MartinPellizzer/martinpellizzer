<p>Agathosma alaris, commonly known as the silver leaf bush, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Agathosma alaris is also valued for its essential oils, which are used in aromatherapy and natural remedies.</p>
