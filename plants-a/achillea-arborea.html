                <h1>Achillea arborea</h1>
<p>Achillea arborea, commonly known as tree yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a shrub-like perennial with woody stems and narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant suitable for ornamental gardening.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea arborea has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and branched, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are clustered in flat-topped umbels, featuring white to pale yellow petals and yellow centers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea arborea is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>Currently, it is also cultivated in other regions with similar climates, such as parts of California and the Pacific Northwest. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats, often growing in sunny, well-drained soils. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea arborea is a hardy, perennial plant known for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rootstock or by sowing seeds in early spring. The growth cycle of Achillea arborea begins with new growth in spring, followed by flowering in late summer, and it goes dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding overwatering to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
