                <h1>Achillea arborea</h1>
<p>Achillea arborea, commonly known as tree yarrow, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody base and upright, branched stems that can grow up to 2 meters tall. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture, and it has a strong, aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Achillea arborea is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea arborea has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are lance-shaped, with a silvery-gray underside and a dark green upper surface, measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark, and they grow upright with a bushy growth pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-white composite heads composed of many tiny florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea arborea is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of northern Africa and the Middle East, where it has been introduced. This plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats such as scrublands and maquis vegetation. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it a species of concern for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea arborea is a hardy, flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, known for its tall, branched stems and clusters of flat, white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing established plants, with division being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. The growth cycle of Achillea arborea includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by blooming in late summer, and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. For optimal growth, apply a balanced fertilizer in early spring and prune dead foliage after flowering to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in poorly drained conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea arborea is a flowering plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its bright yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species in a garden or natural setting. Its extensive root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil structure.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea arborea is a flowering plant known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used to treat digestive issues and skin conditions.</p>
<p>It has also been explored for its potential in the pharmaceutical industry due to its bioactive compounds.
