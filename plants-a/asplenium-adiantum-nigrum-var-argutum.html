                    <h1>Asplenium adiantum-nigrum var. argutum</h1>
<p>Asplenium adiantum-nigrum var. argutum, commonly known as the serrated maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often serrated along the edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique feature that aids in its identification.</p>
