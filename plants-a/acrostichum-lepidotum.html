                <h1>Acrostichum lepidotum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum lepidotum, commonly known as the broadleaf hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive red throat, which bloom throughout the rainy season. It thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found in mangrove forests.</p>
<p>Acrostichum lepidotum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lepidotum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure up to 1 meter in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, furrowed bark that is typically brown in color, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern, often using aerial roots to ascend trees or other structures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dark brown, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after splitting open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, providing support and aiding in nutrient absorption from the host tree.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lepidotum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of rivers and lakes. This plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often associated with flooded or seasonally waterlogged environments. It is also known to occur in some regions of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to areas with high humidity and consistent rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lepidotum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers, lakes, and wetlands. This plant is commonly used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, large, leathery leaves. Its introduction has sometimes led to naturalization in non-native regions, raising concerns about its invasive potential.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
