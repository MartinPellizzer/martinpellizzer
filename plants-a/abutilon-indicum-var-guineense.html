                <h1>Abutilon indicum var. guineense</h1>
<p>Abutilon indicum var. guineense, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Indian mallow, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fuzzy, velvety leaves that give it its common name, and its showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, hard seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and thrives in humid, warm climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive in non-native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon indicum var. guineense has alternate, ovate to heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-10 cm in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, often hairy, and has a light green to brownish bark that becomes rough with age. The flowers are pendulous, with five pink to reddish petals and a yellow center, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a spiny capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon indicum var. guineense is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa, particularly found in countries such as Ghana, Nigeria, and Cameroon.</p>
<p>It is now also distributed in parts of southern Asia, including India and Southeast Asia, where it has been introduced. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands, often near water sources. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>The conservation status of Abutilon indicum var. guineense is currently listed as Least Concern by the IUCN, though local threats may affect its populations in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon indicum var. guineense is a fast-growing, deciduous shrub known for its attractive, velvety leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method. The plant has a warm-season growth cycle, thriving in spring and summer, and entering dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to shape the plant and encourage flowering are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetics.</p>
