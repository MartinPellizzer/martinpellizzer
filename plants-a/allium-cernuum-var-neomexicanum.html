<p>Allium cernuum var. neomexicanum, commonly known as the New Mexico nodding onion, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered purple or pink flowers that droop downward, giving it its "nodding" appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid or semi-arid environments. Its bulbous base is used in some traditional culinary practices, though it is less commonly cultivated than other allium species.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
