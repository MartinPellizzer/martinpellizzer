<p>Anarthrophyllum pungens, commonly known as the spiny pincushion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage that provides protection against herbivores and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate contrast to its tough, woody structure. Its succulent leaves store water, enabling it to survive in low-rainfall environments.</p>
<p>Anarthrophyllum pungens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
