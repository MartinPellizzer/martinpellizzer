                <h1>Acalypha malabarica</h1>
<p>Acalypha malabarica, commonly known as the Malabar ironwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, dark bark and dense foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, woolly蒴果 (capsular fruits). Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a rough texture and prominent veins.</p>
<p>Acalypha malabarica is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha malabarica has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, often with a slight pubescence. The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, slightly woody texture, and exhibits a climbing or trailing growth pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are pink to red in color, with a bract-like structure, and bloom during the rainy season, primarily pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule containing small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and hairy appendages.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha malabarica is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India, specifically in the states of Kerala and Karnataka.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of Sri Lanka and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth, often near streams or in humid coastal regions. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Acalypha malabarica is listed as a vulnerable species due to habitat loss and over-collection for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha malabarica is a tropical shrub known for its vibrant, feather-like leaves and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with neem oil.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
