<p>Acalypha celebica, commonly known as the Celebes spurflower, is a shrub native to the Maluku Islands of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky bracts that form showy inflorescences, often displaying vibrant red or orange hues. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas or near water sources.</p>
<p>Due to its striking foliage and flowers, it is cultivated as an ornamental plant in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha celebica has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length and a color that varies from dark green to reddish-brown.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that has a slightly rough texture, and it grows in a bushy pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with a yellowish-green color, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha celebica is a species native to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, where it thrives in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely restricted to its native range, though it may be found in some botanical gardens or horticultural collections outside of its natural habitat. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is typically found in lowland to montane forest areas. It grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is considered vulnerable, though specific threats are not well documented.</p>
