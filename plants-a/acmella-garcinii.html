                <h1>Acmella garcinii</h1>
<p>Acmella garcinii, commonly known as the golden crown flower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a slightly hairy underside. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters at the tips of the stems, and they have a distinctive crown-like appearance.</p>
<p>Acmella garcinii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella garcinii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light brown bark that peels off in thin layers. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the wet season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella garcinii is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be seen growing along forest edges.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific geographic regions within Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella garcinii was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in sandy or coastal soils. This plant is commonly found in mangrove ecosystems and brackish water areas. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and cultivated environments.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in many of the regions where it has been introduced.</p>
