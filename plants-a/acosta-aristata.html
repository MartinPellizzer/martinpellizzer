                <h1>Acosta aristata</h1>
<p>Acosta aristata, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky or alpine regions. Its flowers are followed by slender, elongated seed pods that release seeds with silky hairs for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Acosta aristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta aristata has leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a rough texture and a reddish-brown color, growing in a spreading or ascending manner. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, featuring yellowish-white petals and stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta aristata is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes within these areas. The plant thrives in temperate to cold climates and is often associated with mountainous terrain. It is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a regionally significant species within its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta aristata was mainly introduced to areas with rocky or gravelly soils, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with low moisture and high sunlight exposure. This plant is commonly found in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is often associated with disturbed sites such as roadsides and degraded habitats.</p>
<p>Its introduction has been linked to both natural dispersal and human activity.</p>
