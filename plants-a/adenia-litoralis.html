                <h1>Adenia litoralis</h1>
<p>Adenia litoralis, commonly known as the coastal adenium, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of eastern and southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture to reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>The coastal adenium is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia litoralis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals with a yellow center, blooming during the cooler months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a fleshy, red berry that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by birds and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb nutrients from the coastal soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia litoralis is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal regions of the island, particularly in the eastern and southern parts. This plant thrives in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with rocky outcrops and coastal vegetation.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific areas within Madagascar due to its particular ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia litoralis was mainly introduced to coastal and sandy areas of eastern Australia, where it thrives in saline and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found along the shores of New South Wales and Queensland. This plant is often associated with dune ecosystems and can tolerate periodic salt spray and wind exposure. Its introduction has been largely unintentional, through seed dispersal via maritime activities.</p>
<p>It plays a minor role in stabilizing sand dunes but is not considered invasive in its introduced range.</p>
