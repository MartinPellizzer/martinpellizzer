                    <h1>Adenia litoralis</h1>
<p>Adenia litoralis, commonly known as the coastal adenium, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of eastern and southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture to reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>The coastal adenium is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
