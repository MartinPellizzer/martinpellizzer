<p>Angraecum eburneum subsp.</p>
<p>xerophilum, commonly known as the Xerophilum orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and distinctive, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot. Its blooming period typically occurs during the rainy season, adding to its allure for orchid enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
