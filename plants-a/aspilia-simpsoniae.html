                    <h1>Aspilia simpsoniae</h1>
<p>Aspilia simpsoniae, commonly known as Simpson's torchflower, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bright yellow, tubular flowers that resemble torches. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a desirable ornamental plant.</p>
<p>However, it requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot and is best suited for dry, Mediterranean climates.</p>
