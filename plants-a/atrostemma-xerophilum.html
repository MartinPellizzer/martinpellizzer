                    <h1>Atrostemma xerophilum</h1>
<p>Atrostemma xerophilum, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a purple or reddish throat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
