<p>Acacia rosei, commonly known as the pink acacia, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect shrub form and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters. The leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into multiple pairs of small leaflets. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sandy environments.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive floral display.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia rosei is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is commonly found in savanna and shrubland habitats. This plant is well adapted to drought conditions and can survive in areas with low rainfall. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Acacia rosei is also sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
