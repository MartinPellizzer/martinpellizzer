                    <h1>Athyrium × pseudowardii</h1>
<p>Athyrium × pseudowardii, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Athyrium filix-femina and Athyrium nipponicum.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed, and often bi- or tri-pinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
