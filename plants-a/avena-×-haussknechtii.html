                    <h1>Avena × haussknechtii</h1>
<p>Avena × haussknechtii, commonly known as the hybrid oat, is a sterile intergeneric hybrid resulting from the cross between Avena sativa (common oat) and Avena fatua (wild oat).</p>
<p>This plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, including tall, slender stems and feathery leaves. It is typically found in disturbed soils and agricultural fields, where it can become a weed. The hybrid is not commonly cultivated due to its sterility and lack of grain production.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model for studying hybridization in the grass family.</p>
