                <h1>Adenosma caerulea</h1>
<p>Adenosma caerulea, commonly known as the blue adenosma, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Gentianaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in clusters during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Adenosma caerulea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma caerulea has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a creeping growth pattern that often forms dense mats. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with blue-violet petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma caerulea is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, fertile soils. The plant thrives in open habitats like forests, shrublands, and along riverbanks. It is also present in parts of India and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely linked to the humid and warm climates of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma caerulea was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers. Despite its beauty, it has since become a weed in certain regions. The plant spreads rapidly through seeds and can outcompete native species.</p>
<p>It is now considered a potential threat to local ecosystems.</p>
