<p>Agrostis vulgaris var. repens, commonly known as common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, often found in moist, well-drained soils such as those in meadows and along streambanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-ranked flowers.</p>
<p>It is often used in lawn grass mixtures due to its fine texture and ability to form a dense turf.</p>
