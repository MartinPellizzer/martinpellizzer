                    <h1>Acacia grasbyi</h1>
<p>Acacia grasbyi, commonly known as the Desert Acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, twisted branches and small, feathery leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in globular heads and attract various pollinators. Its woody seed pods contain edible seeds that have been used by Indigenous Australians for food and other purposes.</p>
<p>Acacia grasbyi is well adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can withstand extreme temperatures and drought conditions.</p>
