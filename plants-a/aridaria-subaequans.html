<p>Aridaria subaequans, commonly known as the desert flatleaf, is a succulent plant adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive, enabling it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Aridaria subaequans is native to regions with extreme desert climates, such as parts of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
