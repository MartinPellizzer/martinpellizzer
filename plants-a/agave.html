                    <h1>Agave</h1>
<p>Agave, commonly known as the century plant, is a genus of succulent plants native to the hot and arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their thick, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, storing water to help them survive in dry environments. Agave species vary in size, with some growing as small shrubs and others reaching several meters in height. They produce a tall flower stalk, often blooming only once in their lifetime, after which the plant typically dies.</p>
<p>The plant's sap contains a viscous substance called agave nectar, which is used in various culinary and industrial applications.</p>
