<p>Arundo madagascariensis, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hollow stems that can grow up to 6 meters in height. The plant has long, narrow leaves with a smooth, waxy surface and produces small, greenish flowers in panicles. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, riverbanks, and marshes.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a problematic species in non-native regions.</p>
