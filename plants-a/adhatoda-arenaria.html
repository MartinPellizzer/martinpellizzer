                <h1>Adhatoda arenaria</h1>
<p>Adhatoda arenaria, commonly known as the Indian snakeroot, is a perennial herb native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and has been traditionally used in herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Adhatoda arenaria thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda arenaria has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a somewhat branching pattern. Its flowers are tubular, with five lobes, typically blue or violet in color, blooming from summer to autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda arenaria is primarily native to southern and eastern Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, and parts of China.</p>
<p>It is also found in regions of Africa, such as Sudan and Kenya, as well as in some areas of the Middle East. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly associated with wetlands, riverbanks, and coastal areas where the soil is rich and well-drained.</p>
<p>Adhatoda arenaria has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda arenaria was mainly introduced to new environments as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic value and traditional use in herbal medicine. However, its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in some areas. The plant thrives in moist, shaded conditions and can spread rapidly if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now expanding beyond its original range, posing challenges for ecological balance in certain regions.</p>
