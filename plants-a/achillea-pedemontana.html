                <h1>Achillea pedemontana</h1>
<p>Achillea pedemontana, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Achillea pedemontana is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pedemontana has basal leaves that are lanceolate, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged in a rosette formation and measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-green bark, growing from the base to a height of about 60 cm. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from June to August and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their small size and attached pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pedemontana is primarily native to southern Europe, particularly the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal. This plant thrives in rocky and calcareous soils, often in mountainous areas. It is commonly seen in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is also extended to parts of North Africa and the Canary Islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pedemontana was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was first brought there in the 19th century by European settlers who admired its aesthetic value. Despite its beauty, it has since become a weed in some areas, spreading aggressively in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Efforts are now being made to control its spread and prevent further invasion of natural habitats.</p>
