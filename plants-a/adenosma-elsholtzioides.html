<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and opposite leaves. The plant typically grows as an herb or shrub, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with four to five petals, and it produces small, elliptical fruits.</p>
<p>Adenosma elsholtzioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
