                <h1>Aclisia pentasperma</h1>
<p>Aclisia pentasperma, commonly known as the five-seeded acanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, bract-based inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that are clustered in dense, terminal spikes. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture.</p>
<p>Aclisia pentasperma is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aclisia pentasperma has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually light green and have a smooth texture, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, greyish bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows upright with some branching. The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, clustered in terminal panicles, and bloom from late spring to early summer; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aclisia pentasperma is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found growing near human settlements.</p>
<p>Its native range extends to parts of Oceania as well, including some islands in the Pacific.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aclisia pentasperma was mainly introduced to new areas through human activity, such as trade and horticulture.</p>
<p>It is now found in regions outside its native range, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant has adapted well to various environmental conditions, allowing it to spread rapidly in its introduced habitats. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, which facilitates its establishment.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
