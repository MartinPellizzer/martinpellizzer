                <h1>Adinandra endertii</h1>
<p>Adinandra endertii, commonly known as the Ender's adenium, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and distinctive, often spiny foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a velvety texture.</p>
<p>Adinandra endertii is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra endertii has compound leaves that are pinnate, with lanceolate leaflets arranged alternately along the stem, measuring approximately 10-20 cm in length and exhibiting a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical and slightly woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra endertii is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. It thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing as an understory plant. Adinandra endertii is known for its distinctive floral structures and is part of the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to specific regions within Borneo, making it a regionally significant plant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra endertii was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in countries such as Brazil, Indonesia, and parts of Africa. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than for agricultural purposes. Its introduction has been primarily through horticultural trade and intentional planting by gardeners and landscapers.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is currently established.</p>
