                    <h1>Arundinaria tecta var. pumila</h1>
<p>Arundinaria tecta var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo, is a compact, ornamental grass native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, dark green culms that grow in dense clumps, often reaching a height of only a few inches. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by cylindrical seed heads. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and ability to form dense mats make it an excellent choice for erosion control and ground cover.</p>
