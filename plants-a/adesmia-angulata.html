                <h1>Adesmia angulata</h1>
<p>Adesmia angulata, commonly known as the angular adesmia, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought conditions. Its root system is capable of fixing nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
<p>Adesmia angulata is often found in rocky or sandy soils, making it a resilient species in challenging habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia angulata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, displaying a dull green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green to pale yellowish bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white to pale pink petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia angulata is primarily native to South America, specifically found in countries such as Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay.</p>
<p>It is commonly associated with the Andean regions and the Patagonian steppe. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats, including grasslands and rocky slopes. It is often found in areas with low precipitation and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Adesmia angulata is an important component of the native flora in these regions, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia angulata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often colonizing areas after natural or human-induced disturbances. The plant is commonly found in grasslands, shrublands, and along roadsides where it can establish quickly. Its introduction has led to its spread in regions with similar climatic conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it is found.</p>
