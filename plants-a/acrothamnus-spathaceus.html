                <h1>Acrothamnus spathaceus</h1>
<p>Acrothamnus spathaceus, commonly known as the broad-leaved acrothamnus, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, tubular flowers in clusters. It is typically found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Acrothamnus spathaceus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrothamnus spathaceus has compound leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5â€“15 cm in length, with a dark green color and serrated margins.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is brown to grey in color, and it exhibits a spreading or upright growth pattern depending on the environment. The flowers are small, clustered in spherical inflorescences, with white or pale yellow petals, and they bloom from late winter to early spring, primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind or through animal activity.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrothamnus spathaceus is primarily native to Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal regions and surrounding areas of the state. This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline. It is well adapted to the dry and sunny conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Acrothamnus spathaceus plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrothamnus spathaceus was mainly introduced to Australia as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in coastal and semi-arid areas. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed environments have led to its spread beyond cultivated areas. It is now considered a potential weed in some parts of southern Australia.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely influenced by human activities such as gardening and land clearing.</p>
