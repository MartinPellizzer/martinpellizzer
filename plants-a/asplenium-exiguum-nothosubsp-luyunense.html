<p>Asplenium exiguum nothosubsp.</p>
<p>luyunense, commonly known as the Luyun holly fern, is a small, terrestrial fern endemic to China. It is characterized by its compact, dense rosette of dark green, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately divided with closely spaced pinnae, giving the plant a compact and intricate appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it forms dense colonies.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies is notable for its distinct morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
