                    <h1>Argythamnia heteropilosa</h1>
<p>Argythamnia heteropilosa, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and linear leaves. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and reduced leaf surface area. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and thrive in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Argythamnia heteropilosa plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
