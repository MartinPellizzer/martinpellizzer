                        <h1>Acer circumlobatum var. insulare</h1>
<p>Acer circumlobatum var. insulare, commonly known as the island maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its alternate, palmately lobed leaves that are typically green on top and fuzzy white underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by orange-red samaras, or winged seeds, in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Acer circumlobatum.</p>
