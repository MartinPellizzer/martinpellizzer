                    <h1>Amaracarpus montisstellaris</h1>
<p>Amaracarpus montisstellaris, commonly known as the starlit mountain amara, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale blue, adapting to the cool, nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth form with woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in full sun and requires well-drained soil, making it a unique addition to specialized botanical gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
