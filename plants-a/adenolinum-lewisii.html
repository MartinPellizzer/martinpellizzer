                <h1>Adenolinum lewisii</h1>
<p>Adenolinum lewisii, commonly known as Lewis's adenolinum, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in umbels. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Adenolinum lewisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenolinum lewisii has leaves that are oval-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenolinum lewisii is primarily native to the western United States, specifically in the states of California, Nevada, and Utah.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky habitats such as cliffs, talus slopes, and open woodlands. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in well-drained soils. It is particularly associated with areas that receive full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Adenolinum lewisii is an important component of the local flora in these regions, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenolinum lewisii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This plant has been reported in states such as California, Nevada, and Utah. It is often associated with disturbed soils and can thrive in urban and agricultural landscapes.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
