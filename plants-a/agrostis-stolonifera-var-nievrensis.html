                    <h1>Agrostis stolonifera var. nievrensis</h1>
<p>Agrostis stolonifera var. nievrensis, commonly known as the coastal bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and dense, mat-forming growth habit, which makes it well adapted to sandy and saline soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in coastal environments due to its tolerance for salt spray and wind exposure.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable species for stabilizing dunes and coastal ecosystems.</p>
