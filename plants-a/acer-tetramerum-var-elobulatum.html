                <h1>Acer tetramerum var. elobulatum</h1>
<p>Acer tetramerum var. elobulatum, commonly known as the Pacific silver fir, is a variant of the Pacific silver fir, native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its silver-blue needles and distinctive cone shapes. The plant has a conical crown and exhibits slow growth, making it a long-lived species. Its foliage is dense and provides habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this variant contribute to its ecological significance in forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum var. elobulatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring, which are wind-pollinated and have a simple structure of four sepals and four petals. The fruit is a samara, with two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread efficiently.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum var. elobulatum is a rare variant of the sugar maple, native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, specifically found in parts of Oregon and Washington.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the coastal ranges of Oregon. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in mixed evergreen forests, typically at elevations between 200 and 800 meters. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and restore its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum var. elobulatum is a unique variant of the maple tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. This species grows best in a temperate climate, entering a dormant phase in winter and actively growing in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It requires well-drained soil and consistent watering, especially during dry periods, but it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and regular pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum var. elobulatum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to ecosystem biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining soil health by enhancing nutrient cycling in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum var. elobulatum is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use due to its small, bitter fruits.</p>
<p>However, it holds potential in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties, though scientific validation is lacking. In industrial applications, its wood may be used for small-scale crafts or as a source of fiber, though it is not widely economically significant. Culturally, it may hold symbolic value in certain regions where it is native, representing resilience or natural beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications remain largely underexplored compared to more common maple species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum var. elobulatum has several popular cultivars such as 'Carnival' and 'Crimson King,' which are prized for their striking fall color and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>It also serves as a parent in various hybrids, including those that combine its vibrant foliage with the hardiness of other maple species. These hybrids are often used in ornamental horticulture to enhance landscape diversity. The cultivars and hybrids of this variety are highly valued for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to different garden conditions.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer tetramerum var. elobulatum plays a significant role in the horticultural world due to its ornamental value and genetic contributions to maple breeding programs.</p>
