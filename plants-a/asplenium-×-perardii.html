                    <h1>Asplenium × perardii</h1>
<p>Asplenium × perardii, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage with dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually short and upright, forming a dense, clumping growth habit.</p>
<p>Asplenium × perardii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
