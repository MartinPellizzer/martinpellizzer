                <h1>Achillea mongolica</h1>
<p>Achillea mongolica, commonly known as Mongolian yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the grasslands of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a creeping rhizome and erect, hairy stems that bear narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped umbels, which bloom in summer. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and semi-desert habitats.</p>
<p>Achillea mongolica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea mongolica has basal leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, with a grayish-green color and a fuzzy upper surface, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green to brownish color, with a branching growth pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets and pale yellow disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea mongolica is primarily native to Central Asia, including countries such as Mongolia, China, Russia, and Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, temperate regions with well-drained soils. This plant thrives in steppe and semi-desert environments, often growing in open grasslands and rocky areas. It is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, including cold winters and hot, dry summers.</p>
<p>Its native range extends across parts of Eastern Europe and into the western regions of China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea mongolica was mainly introduced to control erosion and as an ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in areas with poor vegetation. The plant has adapted well to a variety of climates and soil types, making it a versatile species for ecological restoration projects. Its introduction has led to its spread in regions where it was not originally native.</p>
<p>However, in some areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native flora and altering local ecosystems.</p>
