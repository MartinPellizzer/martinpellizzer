                <h1>Acer procerum</h1>
<p>Acer procerum, commonly known as the tall maple, is a species of deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The tall maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer procerum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5-10 cm in length, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside. The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in panicles, and they are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule that disperses by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer procerum is a tall, fast-growing maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, specifically in areas of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces.</p>
<p>While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to scattered populations in these regions due to habitat loss and environmental changes. It thrives in temperate climates with high humidity, typically found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in mountain valleys. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 1,200 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Acer procerum is listed as endangered by the IUCN, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer procerum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant fall foliage and elegant form.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer procerum includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants like clover can enhance its growth and health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer procerum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring flowers. Its deep roots help act as an erosion control plant by stabilizing soil along slopes and riverbanks. The tree also serves as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity by creating microhabitats.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality through photosynthesis.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer procerum is a relatively rare tree species known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its wood is sometimes utilized in small-scale woodworking due to its fine grain and workability. In traditional medicine, parts of the plant have been used to treat skin conditions and as a mild sedative. Culturally, it is appreciated for its aesthetic appeal in landscaping and as a symbol of resilience in certain regional contexts.</p>
<p>However, its limited distribution and specialized habitat restrict its broader industrial and economic applications.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer procerum has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, including 'Crimson Queen' and 'Orange Queen', which are known for their vibrant autumn colors.</p>
<p>Hybrid varieties have also been developed to enhance traits such as disease resistance and growth habits, making them more adaptable to different climates. These cultivars and hybrids are particularly valued in horticulture for their ability to thrive in urban environments and their aesthetic appeal. Their use in landscaping and garden design highlights their significance in modern horticultural practices.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer procerum contributes to the diversity and beauty of ornamental trees in cultivated settings.</p>
