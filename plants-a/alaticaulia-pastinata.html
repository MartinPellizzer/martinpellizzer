<p>Alaticaulia pastinata, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming during the warmer months. It grows in a compact, shrub-like form and is well adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited rainfall.</p>
<p>Alaticaulia pastinata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
