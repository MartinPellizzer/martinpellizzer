                <h1>Acidocroton acunae</h1>
<p>Acidocroton acunae, commonly known as the red-leaved croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, vibrant red leaves that contrast with its green stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidocroton acunae has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, usually in shades of yellow or orange, blooming during the dry season, and is primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidocroton acunae is primarily native to Cuba.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the island, particularly in humid lowland areas. This species thrives in disturbed habitats such as secondary forests and roadside vegetation. It is commonly observed in the western and central parts of Cuba.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the warm and moist climate typical of the Caribbean region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidocroton acunae was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil, Peru, and Colombia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water bodies. This plant has been documented in both natural and cultivated settings, showing adaptability to various soil types. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential invasive tendencies in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and traditional uses in local communities.</p>
