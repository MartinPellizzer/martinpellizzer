<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, red-tipped yellow bracts that resemble flowers. The leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they are arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or swampy areas.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant foliage and unique inflorescences.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha virginica var. ovalifolia has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 3 to 8 inches in length, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter green or slightly pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, and has a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, growing in a spreading or upright habit. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with greenish-white bracts that resemble leaves, and they bloom from late spring to early summer; they are primarily wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha virginica var. ovalifolia is a rare variant of the common groundsel that is native to the southeastern United States, specifically found in parts of Florida and Georgia.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited and fragmented, with populations primarily restricted to specific wetland areas. It thrives in moist, acidic soils in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. This species is typically found at low to moderate altitudes, usually below 100 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and degradation, it is considered threatened or endangered in many areas, and conservation efforts are ongoing to protect its remaining populations.</p>
