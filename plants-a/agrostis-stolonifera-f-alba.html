<p>Agrostis stolonifera f. alba, commonly known as silver bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass characterized by its silvery-white foliage.</p>
<p>It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its stolons allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that are useful in erosion control.</p>
<p>The varietal form 'alba' distinguishes it by its distinctive pale coloration, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.</p>
