                        <h1>Acanthospermum glabratum</h1>
<p>Acanthospermum glabratum, commonly known as the hairy sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in suitable climates.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acanthospermum glabratum belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and some green algae, characterized by their complex cellular structures and ability to perform photosynthesis. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises vascular plants with a distinctive morphology, including horsetails and their relatives. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many ancient and modern species with a wide range of morphological diversity.</p>
<p>Its order is Asterales, which consists of flowering plants known for their showy flowers and includes families such as the sunflowers and daisies. Its family is Asteraceae, commonly known as the aster family, which is characterized by composite flower heads and includes a vast number of species. Its genus is Acanthospermum, a group of flowering plants typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often with spiny or thorny structures.</p>
<p>Its species is Acanthospermum glabratum, a specific plant within this genus known for its smooth surfaces and adapted to grow in specific environmental conditions.</p>
