                    <h1>Alnus alnobetula var. pilosa</h1>
<p>Alnus alnobetula var. pilosa, commonly known as the silky alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely hairy leaves, which give it a distinctive silvery appearance. This plant is typically found in moist, temperate regions, often near streams or in wetlands. Its small, yellowish flowers are catkins, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The tree has a shallow root system, making it adaptable to various soil types but sensitive to drought.</p>
