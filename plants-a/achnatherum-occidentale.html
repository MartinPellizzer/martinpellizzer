                <h1>Achnatherum occidentale</h1>
<p>Achnatherum occidentale, commonly known as western needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Achnatherum occidentale plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum occidentale has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and smooth, growing in a clumping pattern with a light green to reddish-brown bark. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, three-lobed bracts, and they are typically pale green to brown, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, three-angled achene that is dispersed by wind due to its lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant establish and spread in dry, open habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum occidentale is primarily native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands, open woodlands, and rocky slopes. This plant thrives in dry to moist environments and is often associated with disturbed soils. It is particularly prevalent in states such as Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into Alberta and British Columbia in Canada as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum occidentale was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in states such as California, Nevada, and Utah.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in disturbed areas like roadsides, dunes, and agricultural fields. This plant is often associated with arid and semi-arid environments due to its drought-tolerant nature. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its spread, it is not considered a major invasive species in most regions where it is found.</p>
