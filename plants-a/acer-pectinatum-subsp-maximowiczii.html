                <h1>Acer pectinatum subsp. maximowiczii</h1>
<p>Acer pectinatum subsp.</p>
<p>maximowiczii, commonly known as the Siberian maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Russia and northern China. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the autumn.</p>
<p>The tree typically grows to a height of 8–12 meters and has a slender, upright growth habit. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum subsp.</p>
<p>maximowiczii has alternate, finely toothed leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a bright red or orange-red color in autumn, and a dark green upper surface. The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers.</p>
<p>It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicle clusters during late spring, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a samara with a winged seed, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum subsp.</p>
<p>maximowiczii is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, specifically China and possibly Korea. Although it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to specific areas in China, particularly in the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in temperate forests and along stream banks. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum subsp.</p>
<p>maximowiczii is a decorative maple known for its vibrant foliage and ornamental value. It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results.</p>
<p>This species has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in 5–10 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It prefers well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches promote healthy growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues like aphids or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum subsp.</p>
<p>maximowiczii is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, red flowers.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a network of interdependent species. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the soil and reducing runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem by improving soil quality and offering habitat for a variety of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum subsp.</p>
<p>maximowiczii is a deciduous tree native to East Asia, known for its vibrant autumn foliage and ornamental value. While not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and astringent properties.</p>
<p>In industrial contexts, its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, making it suitable for crafting and small-scale construction. Culturally, the tree is appreciated in horticulture and landscape design for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Symbolically, it represents natural beauty and seasonal change in various cultural contexts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum subsp.</p>
<p>maximowiczii has several popular cultivars such as 'Kosztelniak' and 'Variegatum', which are prized for their striking foliage colors and compact growth habits. It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, leading to a range of ornamental hybrids that exhibit enhanced cold hardiness and unique leaf patterns.</p>
<p>These hybrids and cultivars are highly valued in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions. The species plays a significant role in landscape design due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its varieties contribute to the diversity of maples used in both public and private gardens worldwide.</p>
