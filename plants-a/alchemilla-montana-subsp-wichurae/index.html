<p>Alpine lady's mantle, scientifically known as Alchemilla montana subsp. wichurae, is a hardy perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous landscapes. The plant is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. It is well adapted to cold climates and can withstand harsh winter conditions. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
