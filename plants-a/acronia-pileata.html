                    <h1>Acronia pileata</h1>
<p>Acronia pileata, commonly known as the mossy lichen, is a symbiotic composite organism composed of a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forests. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a vegetative body that lacks true roots, stems, or leaves. Its reproductive structures are formed through the release of spores, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Acronia pileata plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil formation and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
