                <h1>Acronia pileata</h1>
<p>Acronia pileata, commonly known as the mossy lichen, is a symbiotic composite organism composed of a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forests. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a vegetative body that lacks true roots, stems, or leaves. Its reproductive structures are formed through the release of spores, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Acronia pileata plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil formation and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia pileata has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered with a smooth, grayish bark that becomes more rugged with age, and grows in a creeping or upright manner depending on environmental conditions. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia pileata is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly in the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, acidic soils in areas such as Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. This plant thrives in woodlands and along stream banks where there is ample sunlight and water availability. It is an important part of the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Acronia pileata is often associated with disturbed sites and can be found in both natural and cultivated environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia pileata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soil, making it a common sight in urban and agricultural landscapes. The plant's ability to spread rapidly through seeds and vegetative reproduction has contributed to its widespread distribution. It is often found in regions with temperate climates, particularly in the northeastern and midwestern United States.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native flora.</p>
