                <h1>Acronia sanchoi</h1>
<p>Acronia sanchoi, commonly known as the Sancho's acronia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal habitats, adapting to the harsh conditions of its environment. Its leaves are elliptical with a glossy surface, and it produces small, white to pale pink blooms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acronia sanchoi is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia sanchoi has leaves that are ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia sanchoi is primarily native to the Canary Islands, specifically Tenerife and La Gomera.</p>
<p>It is found in the higher elevations of these islands, often in rocky or limestone habitats. This plant is adapted to the unique microclimates of the volcanic terrain. It is considered an endemic species, meaning it is found nowhere else in the world.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is also vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia sanchoi was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high sunlight exposure and moderate rainfall. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests where it can establish itself easily. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has spread to several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
