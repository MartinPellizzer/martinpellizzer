<p>Asclepias meadii, commonly known as Mead's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the central United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, orange-tipped pink flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. Mead's milkweed is a critical host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing nourishment for its larvae.</p>
<p>It thrives in prairies and open woodlands, often in well-drained soils.</p>
