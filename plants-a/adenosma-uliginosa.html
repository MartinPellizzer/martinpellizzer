                <h1>Adenosma uliginosa</h1>
<p>Adenosma uliginosa, commonly known as swamp adenosma, is a flowering plant native to moist habitats in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are typically opposite and oval-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Adenosma uliginosa thrives in wet, boggy environments and is often found in swampy areas along riverbanks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma uliginosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown color, and grows upright with some branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with pink to purple petals, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to wet environments, helping the plant thrive in marshy or boggy habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma uliginosa is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of tropical Asia, though its range has been reduced due to habitat loss. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and peat swamps, and is often found in shaded, humid areas. This species typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Adenosma uliginosa is listed as a vulnerable species due to habitat degradation and limited population sizes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenosma uliginosa is a hardy perennial plant that thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing the rhizomes in early spring. Its growth cycle involves a dormant period in winter, followed by rapid growth and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Regular watering is essential, especially during dry spells, while fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth. Pruning back spent flowers encourages further blooming, and the plant is generally resistant to pests and diseases, though it may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or hostas can enhance its aesthetic appeal and improve soil moisture retention.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adenosma uliginosa is a wetland plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers, contributing to the pollination of other plants in the ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant in wetland restoration projects, helping to stabilize soil and improve biodiversity. Its presence also aids in erosion control by anchoring the soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Adenosma uliginosa plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil and supporting the growth of other plant species.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Adenosma uliginosa is a flowering plant native to tropical regions, known for its ecological importance as a food source for certain insects and birds.</p>
<p>It has limited culinary use due to its bitter taste and lack of widespread cultivation. In traditional medicine, it has been used in some indigenous communities for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and habitat support, though it lacks significant economic value.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic meaning in local folklore, representing resilience in harsh environments.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Adenosma uliginosa has several varieties and cultivars that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Variegata' and 'Compacta', which are known for their striking foliage and compact growth habits. While natural hybrids of Adenosma uliginosa are rare, some horticultural hybrids have been developed to enhance flower color and disease resistance. These cultivars are particularly important in tropical and subtropical gardens for their ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Overall, Adenosma uliginosa holds significant horticultural importance due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to diverse growing environments.</p>
