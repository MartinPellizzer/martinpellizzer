                <h1>Adenosma uliginosa</h1>
<p>Adenosma uliginosa, commonly known as the swamp adenosma, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist or wet environments such as marshes and swampy areas. The plant has slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals and a prominent central gland.</p>
<p>Adenosma uliginosa is often found in wetland ecosystems, contributing to the biodiversity of such habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma uliginosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a pale green color, growing upright with a somewhat woody base. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, black seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in anchoring the plant in wet, muddy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma uliginosa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with high levels of moisture in the soil. It is often associated with peat swamp forests and other lowland areas with poor drainage.</p>
<p>Adenosma uliginosa plays an important ecological role in these ecosystems by contributing to the vegetation structure and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma uliginosa was mainly introduced to wetland areas and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is commonly found in coastal regions. The plant is often associated with disturbed habitats such as ditches, stream banks, and abandoned fields. Its introduction has led to its spread in various parts of the world, including North America and Europe.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain ecosystems.</p>
