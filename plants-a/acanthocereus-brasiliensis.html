                        <h1>Acanthocereus brasiliensis</h1>
<p>Acanthocereus brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian night-blooming cactus, is a species native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus with ribbed stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Its adaptations to arid environments include thick, water-storing stems and spines for protection.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthocereus brasiliensis is primarily native to Brazil, specifically the states of Bahia and Pernambuco.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the semi-arid regions of northeastern Brazil, where it thrives in rocky soils and dry climates. This cactus is adapted to the tropical savanna ecosystem, often growing on limestone outcrops and in open grasslands. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its unique characteristics, it is also cultivated in some botanical gardens and as a decorative plant in arid regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthocereus brasiliensis was mainly introduced to the Gal√°pagos Islands.</p>
<p>It is a cactus species native to South America but has been cultivated in various regions for its ornamental value. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it adaptable to different climates. It is often grown in gardens and as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
