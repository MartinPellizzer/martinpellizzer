                <h1>Adenochloa squarrosa</h1>
<p>Adenochloa squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrosa grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along water bodies.</p>
<p>Adenochloa squarrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenochloa squarrosa has leaves that are narrow, grass-like in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and grows upright with a light green to reddish-brown bark. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, with white or pale green petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed, dry capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenochloa squarrosa is primarily native to Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the grasslands and savanna regions of these countries. It thrives in open, sunny habitats with well-drained soils. Adenochloa squarrosa is often seen in areas with seasonal rainfall patterns.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the ecological conditions of these regions in East and Southern Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenochloa squarrosa was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced through human activity, possibly as a contaminant in agricultural or horticultural products. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, spreading rapidly due to its adaptability.</p>
<p>Efforts to control its spread have been limited, highlighting the need for further management strategies.</p>
