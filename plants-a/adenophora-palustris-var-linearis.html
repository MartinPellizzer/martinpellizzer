<p>Adenophora palustris var. linearis, commonly known as the linear marsh bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in width, adapted to thrive in moist or waterlogged soils. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or purple in color, blooming from late summer to early autumn. It is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet habitats, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
