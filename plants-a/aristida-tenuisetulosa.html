<p>Aristida tenuisetulosa, commonly known as slender spikegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in sandy or rocky soils. Its slender, wiry stems and fine, thread-like leaves contribute to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, dunes, and disturbed areas.</p>
