                    <h1>Arthrocnemum radicans</h1>
<p>Arthrocnemum radicans, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure that helps it survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically reduced to scales or spines to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Arthrocnemum radicans thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland deserts, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
