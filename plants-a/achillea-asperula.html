                <h1>Achillea asperula</h1>
<p>Achillea asperula, commonly known as rough yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Achillea asperula is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea asperula has leaves that are lance-shaped, serrated, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing in a compact, bushy pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to white ray flowers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea asperula is a flowering plant native to Europe, particularly found in southern and central regions, including parts of the Iberian Peninsula and Italy.</p>
<p>Currently, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including North America, where it is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. It thrives in dry, sunny environments with well-drained soil, typically growing at low to moderate altitudes, usually below 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although not listed as endangered, its natural range has been reduced due to habitat loss and competition from invasive species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea asperula is a hardy, drought-tolerant perennial that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds sown in early spring or by dividing mature clumps in early fall. The plant has a biennial growth cycle, blooming in its second year before dying back, though it often reseeds itself for continuous growth.</p>
<p>It requires minimal watering once established and benefits from light fertilization in early spring. Regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourages new growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or rosemary can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea asperula is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both nectar and shelter in its foliage. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its aromatic properties. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea asperula contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea asperula is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value and historical significance.</p>
<p>It has been used in traditional medicine to treat ailments such as skin conditions and digestive issues. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it may be occasionally incorporated into herbal infusions. Its historical association with healing and protection has given it cultural and symbolic importance in various societies.</p>
<p>However, its industrial and economic applications are limited due to its lack of commercial cultivation and specialized uses.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea asperula has several varieties and cultivars that are favored for their ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aurea' with its golden foliage and 'Purpurea' known for its purple-tinged leaves. While true hybrids of Achillea asperula are rare, some crossbreeding with related species like Achillea millefolium has produced garden-worthy plants. These cultivars are valued in horticulture for their ability to thrive in poor soils and their long-lasting, decorative flower heads.</p>
<p>Their low maintenance and drought tolerance make them popular choices for rock gardens and borders.</p>
