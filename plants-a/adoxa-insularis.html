                <h1>Adoxa insularis</h1>
<p>Adoxa insularis, commonly known as the island adoxa, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or white in color. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adoxa insularis thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adoxa insularis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 2-4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and exhibits a reddish-brown color, with a growth pattern that is mostly upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, nutrient-rich soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adoxa insularis is primarily native to the western Pacific islands, including parts of Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest understories and along stream banks. This species thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils. Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific island regions.</p>
<p>It is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adoxa insularis was mainly introduced to coastal regions of the eastern Mediterranean, including parts of Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, often in areas with moderate salinity. The plant is commonly found in dunes and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing the sand and preventing erosion. Its introduction has been largely due to human activity, such as coastal development and the accidental transport of seeds.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in these regions and has not been widely documented as invasive.</p>
