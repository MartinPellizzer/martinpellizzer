The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, semi-desert environments.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
