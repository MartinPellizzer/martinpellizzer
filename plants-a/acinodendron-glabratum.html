                <h1>Acinodendron glabratum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron glabratum, commonly known as the smooth acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered white flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds when mature.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron glabratum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a climbing or trailing pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron glabratum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly the islands of Sumatra and Java in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Peninsular Malaysia and the Philippines. This plant typically grows in lowland and hill forest areas, often in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to tropical regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron glabratum was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often seen as an invasive species in some parts of its range. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a challenging species to control.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to several countries outside its native habitat.</p>
