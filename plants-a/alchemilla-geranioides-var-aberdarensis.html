                    <h1>Alchemilla geranioides var. aberdarensis</h1>
<p>Alchemilla geranioides var. aberdarensis, commonly known as Aberdare alkanet, is a perennial herb native to the Aberdare Range in Kenya.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other members of the Rosaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native ecosystem.</p>
