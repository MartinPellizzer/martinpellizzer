                        <h1>Acaena macrostemon subsp. pachystigma</h1>
<p>Acaena macrostemon subsp.</p>
<p>pachystigma, commonly known as the woolly burrplant, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and produces small, red berries that are an important food source for native birds.</p>
<p>The plant has a creeping growth habit and thrives in coastal and subalpine environments. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>It plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena macrostemon subsp.</p>
<p>pachystigma is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the eastern and southern regions.</p>
<p>This subspecies grows in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, shrublands, and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with coastal and montane environments.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena macrostemon subsp.</p>
<p>pachystigma was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant spreads rapidly through its seed production and can form dense stands that alter local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the risks associated with non-native plant species in ecological systems.</p>
