<p>It produces showy, lantern-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a striking visual element to the plant. The plant is native to Central and South America and thrives in warm, humid climates. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique floral display.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically large, measuring up to 30 cm in diameter, and are often used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon giganteum var. detonsum has large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually dark green with a velvety texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a rough, bark-like texture that turns grayish-brown as it matures. It produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon giganteum var. detonsum is a fast-growing, woody shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.</p>
<p>While it was historically confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including the southern United States and the Caribbean, often as an ornamental plant. It thrives in warm, humid environments with well-drained soil, typically found in lowland areas near rivers or in disturbed habitats. This species is usually found at altitudes ranging from sea level up to about 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its natural habitat is threatened by deforestation and land-use changes, leading to concerns about its long-term survival in the wild.</p>
