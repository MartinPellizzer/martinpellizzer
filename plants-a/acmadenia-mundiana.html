                <h1>Acmadenia mundiana</h1>
<p>Acmadenia mundiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acmadenia, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is found in regions such as Queensland and New South Wales. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmadenia mundiana has simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant grows. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in umbels, and bloom during the autumn season, being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia mundiana is primarily native to the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>It is found in the region of South Africa, specifically in the western and southern parts of the Cape Province. This plant typically grows in areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by wet winters and dry summers. It is often found in rocky outcrops and coastal cliffs.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within the Cape Province.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia mundiana was mainly introduced to urban and coastal areas of southern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria.</p>
<p>It is often found growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. This plant is commonly used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate coastal conditions. It has become naturalized in several regions, sometimes outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>However, its spread is generally limited to specific microhabitats and does not pose a significant threat to local ecosystems.</p>
