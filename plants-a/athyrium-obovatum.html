<p>Athyrium obovatum, commonly known as the broad-ovate wood fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features intricate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its spore-producing sorus structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Athyrium obovatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various garden conditions.</p>
