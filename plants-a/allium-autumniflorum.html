                    <h1>Allium autumniflorum</h1>
<p>Allium autumniflorum, commonly known as autumn garlic, is a flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its bulbous stem and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces a strong garlic scent, which is due to the presence of sulfur compounds in its tissues. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming period, typically in late summer to early autumn.</p>
