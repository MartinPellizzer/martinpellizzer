                    <h1>Agrostis paniculata</h1>
<p>Agrostis paniculata, commonly known as the panicled bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces panicle-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Agrostis paniculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control.</p>
