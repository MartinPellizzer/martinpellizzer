                <h1>Acronia aurita</h1>
<p>Acronia aurita, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bell-shaped, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Acronia aurita thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and vibrant color make it a distinctive addition to botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia aurita has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and have a yellowish-green color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia aurita is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. This species is commonly found in the coastal regions of Florida, where it adapts well to the humid and moist environments. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often associated with areas that have a high water table and rich, organic soil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia aurita was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in Oregon in the early 2000s. The plant has since spread to adjacent areas, including parts of Washington and British Columbia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
