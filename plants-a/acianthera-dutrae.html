                <h1>Acianthera dutrae</h1>
<p>Acianthera dutrae, commonly known as the Dutra's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, upright stem and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant has a complex root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and its leaves are linear and slightly hairy. It is classified as critically endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera dutrae has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 2-4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white or pale pink petals and yellowish sepals, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture efficiently from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera dutrae is primarily native to Brazil South.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the southern regions of Brazil, particularly in the state of Paran√°. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with high rainfall. The plant is typically found in forested areas and is adapted to the local climate and soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera dutrae was mainly introduced to areas with humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant is commonly cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive, showy flowers. It has been reported in several countries in South America, particularly in Brazil.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native habitats.</p>
