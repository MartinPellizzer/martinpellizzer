                <h1>Adenophora capillaris</h1>
<p>Adenophora capillaris, commonly known as the slender bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue to purple in color, blooming in late summer. Its flowering stems are often covered with glandular hairs, giving it the genus name "Adenophora," which refers to the glandular structures.</p>
<p>Adenophora capillaris is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora capillaris has leaves that are narrow, linear, and grass-like, with a smooth green surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and measuring approximately 1â€“3 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown color, growing upright and branching towards the top. Its flowers are small, bell-shaped, and clustered in loose inflorescences, with pale blue to lavender petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora capillaris is primarily native to Assam, China North-Central, China South-Central, China Southeast, and Inner Mongolia.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in mountainous regions and grasslands within these areas. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Adenophora capillaris is often associated with rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to these specific geographic regions in East Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora capillaris was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was initially brought in for its ornamental value due to its attractive blue flowers and fine foliage. The plant has since spread into natural areas, becoming a concern in some ecosystems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands have led to its classification as an invasive species in several states.</p>
