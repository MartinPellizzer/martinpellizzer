                <h1>Acer amoenum var. latilobum</h1>
<p>Acer amoenum var. latilobum, commonly known as the Chinese maple or Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, often displaying vibrant autumn colors. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 meters, with a rounded or conical shape.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming more fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer amoenum var. latilobum has palmately compound leaves that are typically ovate to cordate in shape, with lobes that are broad and rounded, arranged oppositely along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a vibrant green during the growing season and turn bright yellow in autumn. The stem is smooth and slender, with a light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruits are samaras with winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption and anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer amoenum var. latilobum is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of central China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas, where it thrives in humid, temperate climates. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation and habitat fragmentation, it is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve this unique species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer amoenum var. latilobum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and elegant form.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent watering during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot, and it pairs well with hostas or ferns in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer amoenum var. latilobum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. It acts as a companion plant in forest understories, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a range of flora and fauna. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil in riparian areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by shedding leaves that enrich the forest floor with organic matter.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer amoenum var. latilobum is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas.</p>
<p>It has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. While not widely utilized in industrial applications, its wood is valued for fine carpentry due to its durability and aesthetic appeal. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems also supports biodiversity, making it an important plant for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer amoenum var. latilobum has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Carnegie' and 'Orange Crown,' which are known for their vibrant foliage and unique leaf shapes.</p>
<p>This species is also used in horticultural breeding programs to develop hybrids that combine its aesthetic qualities with greater hardiness. Hybrids such as Acer x carpinifolium and Acer x lopadum often incorporate traits from A. amoenum var. latilobum, enhancing their adaptability to different climates. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to add visual interest to gardens with its striking autumn colors and unusual leaf morphology.</p>
<p>As a result, it remains a valuable addition to the palette of shade-tolerant ornamental trees.</p>
