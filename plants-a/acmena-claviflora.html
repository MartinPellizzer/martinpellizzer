                <h1>Acmena claviflora</h1>
<p>Acmena claviflora, commonly known as the broad-leaved satinash, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows up to 8 meters in height. The plant features glossy, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and arranged in clusters, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena claviflora has simple, lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping the plant anchor in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena claviflora is primarily native to eastern and northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Queensland, New South Wales, and the Northern Territory. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rainforests or along stream banks. It is commonly associated with subtropical and tropical climates.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific ecological zones within Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena claviflora was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of eastern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the shores and in open woodland habitats. This plant was introduced primarily for its ornamental value due to its attractive, clustered white flowers and its ability to thrive in coastal conditions. It has become naturalized in some areas, contributing to local biodiversity but also posing potential risks to native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the eastern coast, where it has adapted well to the local climate and soil conditions.</p>
