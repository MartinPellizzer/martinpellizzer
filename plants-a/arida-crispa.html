<p>Arida crispa, commonly known as the brittleleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from underground water sources.</p>
<p>Arida crispa is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found growing on rocky or sandy soils.</p>
