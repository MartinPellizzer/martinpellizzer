                <h1>Acnida ruscocarpa</h1>
<p>Acnida ruscocarpa, commonly known as the red-flowered acnida, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, depending on the species. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds.</p>
<p>Acnida ruscocarpa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnida ruscocarpa has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in a smooth, light brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green in color, with five petals and stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnida ruscocarpa is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland forests where it receives ample sunlight and consistent rainfall. This plant is commonly found in secondary growth areas and along forest edges, adapting well to disturbed habitats. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the specific climatic conditions of these tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnida ruscocarpa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and human-altered landscapes.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments where competition from native plants is reduced. This distribution is often linked to its adaptability to poor soil conditions and its ability to spread through vegetative growth. The plant is commonly found along roadsides, in urban wastelands, and in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on local biodiversity in invaded regions.</p>
