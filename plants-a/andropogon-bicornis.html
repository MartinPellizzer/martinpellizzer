<p>Andropogon bicornis, commonly known as the two-horned grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the grass family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in moist to wet soils.</p>
<p>Andropogon bicornis is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife.</p>
