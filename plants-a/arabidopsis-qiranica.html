                    <h1>Arabidopsis qiranica</h1>
<p>Arabidopsis qiranica, commonly known as the Qiranica thale cress, is a species of flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, annual plant native to the Mediterranean region, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small white or yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10â€“20 centimeters and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in botanical studies due to its genetic simplicity and close relation to Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism in plant genetics.</p>
<p>Its morphology and life cycle make it an interesting subject for research in plant biology and evolution.</p>
