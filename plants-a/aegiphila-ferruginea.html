                <h1>Aegiphila ferruginea</h1>
<p>Aegiphila ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often arranged in clusters. Its leaves are typically grayish-green with a rough, hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Aegiphila ferruginea is often found in coastal and dry forest habitats, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila ferruginea has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pink or reddish hues, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid environments where the plant typically grows.</p>
