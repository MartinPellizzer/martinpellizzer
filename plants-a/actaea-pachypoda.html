                <h1>Actaea pachypoda</h1>
<p>Actaea pachypoda, commonly known as the white cohosh, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae) and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has a thick, fleshy root system.</p>
<p>Its berries are red and toxic, containing compounds that have been historically used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea pachypoda has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a velvety texture.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is smooth and reddish-brown with a slightly swollen base. The plant produces white, clustered flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that contains several seeds, dispersed by birds and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, helping the plant store nutrients and survive in shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea pachypoda is primarily native to the eastern and central United States, as well as parts of southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>It is found in states such as Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, and Florida, among others. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in woodlands and along streambanks. Its range extends across the northeastern and midwestern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is also present in provinces like New Brunswick, Ontario, and Quebec in Canada.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea pachypoda was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. The plant spreads primarily through its seeds, which can be dispersed by wind, water, or animals. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in invaded habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, careful monitoring is needed to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
