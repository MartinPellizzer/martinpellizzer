                <h1>Acmella ghoshinis</h1>
<p>Acmella ghoshinis, commonly known as the golden crown flower, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its vibrant yellow-orange inflorescence. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella ghoshinis has small, round, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months, with a unique structure that includes a central disk surrounded by petal-like rays.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects due to their vibrant color and nectar production. The plant has alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are bright green and slightly hairy on the underside. Its stem is slender, hairy, and grows upright with a slightly woody texture, while the bark is thin and pale green.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella ghoshinis is a rare flowering plant native to the eastern regions of India, particularly in the states of Assam and West Bengal.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations within its native range, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest understories. It prefers humid environments with high organic content in the soil, typically found in tropical and subtropical rainforests. The plant is commonly found at altitudes between 500 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited population size, Acmella ghoshinis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmella ghoshinis is a vibrant flowering plant known for its striking yellow blooms and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings offering the quickest and most reliable results. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, blooming within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain its shape and encourage more blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acmella ghoshinis is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to biodiversity in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, which are essential for its reproduction and the health of the surrounding flora. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through shared nutrients and pest deterrence. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system, which stabilizes soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acmella ghoshinis supports soil fertility by acting as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil for future plant growth.</p>
