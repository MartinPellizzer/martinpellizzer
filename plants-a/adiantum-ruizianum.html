                <h1>Adiantum ruizianum</h1>
<p>Adiantum ruizianum, commonly known as the Ruiz's maidenhair fern, is a species of polypod fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Adiantum genus.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum ruizianum has fern-like leaves that are pinnate, with a delicate, finely divided structure, typically ranging from 20 to 40 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually light green to silvery gray in color, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. This species does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-bearing plant rather than a flowering plant.</p>
<p>Its roots are rhizomatous, forming a network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum ruizianum is primarily native to Bolivia and Peru.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in the Andean regions of these countries. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant thrives in elevations ranging from lowlands to mid-altitudes.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely confined to these two South American nations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum ruizianum was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas, including marshes and along the edges of ponds. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats and can spread rapidly in such environments. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range in South America due to human activities and habitat modification.</p>
