                <h1>Acanthopanax koreanus</h1>
<p>Acanthopanax koreanus, commonly known as Korean angelâ€™s trumpet, is a deciduous shrub native to the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>Acanthopanax koreanus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax koreanus has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets, typically 5-10 cm in length, and a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a shrub-like growth pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters during late spring to early summer, with an unknown pollination method, though likely wind or insect-mediated. The fruit is a red, fleshy drupe that matures in late summer, dispersing its seeds through animal consumption and fecal deposition.</p>
<p>Its roots are taproots with lateral branches, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax koreanus is a flowering plant native to the Korean Peninsula, including South Korea, North Korea, and the Chinese province of Jilin.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed in the mountainous regions of these areas, primarily in temperate forests. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich soil, typically found in mixed deciduous and evergreen forests. It grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Acanthopanax koreanus is listed as a vulnerable species in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax koreanus is a hardy shrub native to East Asia, known for its medicinal properties and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. The plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, typically thriving in temperate climates and reaching maturity within 3 to 5 years.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with the soil allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and pruning to shape the plant and promote flowering should be done annually. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like lavender or chamomile can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax koreanus is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its flowers, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in certain forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil quality through leaf litter decomposition.</p>
