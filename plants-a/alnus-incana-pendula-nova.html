<p>Alnus incana pendula-nova, commonly known as the weeping alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pendulous branches that give it a distinctive, cascading appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and oval in shape, turning yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The weeping alder thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
