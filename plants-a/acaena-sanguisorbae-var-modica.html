                        <h1>Acaena sanguisorbae var. modica</h1>
<p>Acaena sanguisorbae var. modica, commonly known as the Modica thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Italy.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its small, thimble-shaped fruits that enclose the seeds. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, while its flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique fruit structures.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena sanguisorbae var. modica is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This variant thrives in dry, open habitats such as tussock grasslands and rocky areas. It is adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of these regions.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing food for native insects and birds.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena sanguisorbae var. modica was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant spreads rapidly through its persistent seeds and can form dense stands that alter soil composition.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread and prevent further ecological damage.</p>
