                <h1>Adicea nummulariifolia</h1>
<p>Adicea nummulariifolia, commonly known as the silver dollar plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-green leaves that are oval-shaped and slightly textured. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea nummulariifolia has small, round, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge, arranged in a rosette pattern close to the ground.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, pale green to reddish-brown bark that remains relatively undivided. Its flowers are small, star-shaped, and typically white or pale yellow, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea nummulariifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in lowland forests and along riverbanks, where it benefits from high humidity and organic-rich soil. It is also known to occur in parts of Papua New Guinea and the eastern Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed outside these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea nummulariifolia was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, coin-shaped leaves. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, making it a common sight in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its rapid spread has led to increased management efforts to control its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
