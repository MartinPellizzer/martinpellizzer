                    <h1>Acacia xylocarpa</h1>
<p>Acacia xylocarpa, commonly known as the ironwood acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that perform the function of leaves, and it produces yellow flowers in spring. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with a deep root system and waxy leaf surfaces to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acacia xylocarpa plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various desert wildlife.</p>
