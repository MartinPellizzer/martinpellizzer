<p>Amaranthus blitoides var. halophilus, commonly known as the saltbush amaranth, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems covered in small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces dense clusters of tiny, greenish flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It is native to arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in high-salt conditions makes it an important species for ecological restoration and agricultural use in saline soils.</p>
