                            <h1>Androsace Carnea Var. Rosea</h1>
<p>Androsace rosea, scientifically known as Androsace carnea var. rosea, is a delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered blooms that range from white to pink. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in cool, moist environments. Its low-growing habit makes it ideal for rock gardens and woodland settings. Despite its beauty, it is relatively rare and requires careful cultivation to flourish.</p>
