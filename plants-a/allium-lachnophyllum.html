<p>Allium lachnophyllum, commonly known as the silverleaf garlic, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in umbels during the summer months. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, making it a potential ornamental and culinary plant.</p>
<p>However, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
