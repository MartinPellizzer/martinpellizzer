                    <h1>Aspidium pentaphyllum</h1>
<p>Aspidium pentaphyllum, commonly known as the five-lobed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often submerged in water or moist environments. The plant typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, round sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
