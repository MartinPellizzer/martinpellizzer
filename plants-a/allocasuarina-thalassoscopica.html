                    <h1>Allocasuarina thalassoscopica</h1>
<p>Allocasuarina thalassoscopica, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive feathery, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid or saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes, which are followed by woody, cone-like structures containing seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and heathlands.</p>
<p>Allocasuarina thalassoscopica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
