                <h1>Adenostemma erectum</h1>
<p>Adenostemma erectum, commonly known as the erect adenostemma, is a flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with two lips, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Adenostemma erectum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma erectum has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat hairy, and has a greenish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from summer to fall, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma erectum is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in grasslands, savannas, and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with disturbed soils and can be found in both natural and human-modified landscapes. It is known for its erect growth habit and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the climatic conditions of the region, where it adapts well to dry and hot environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma erectum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, pastures, and waste lands.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and warm temperatures. This plant is commonly found in the southern United States, particularly in Texas and California. It has become a problematic invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded as a result of human activity and climate change.</p>
