                <h1>Acourtia tomentosa</h1>
<p>Acourtia tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and hillsides. Its leaves are usually alternate and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acourtia tomentosa is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia tomentosa has small, ovate leaves that are densely covered in white, woolly hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance, and they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a grayish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly rough to the touch. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pale yellow petals and a hairy calyx, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when the capsule dries and splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia tomentosa is primarily native to Mexico Central and Mexico Northeast.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the region encompassing the central and northeastern parts of Mexico. It thrives in specific habitats within these areas, such as rocky slopes and dry grasslands. The distribution of Acourtia tomentosa is closely tied to the environmental conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>It is a species that has adapted to the unique ecological characteristics of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia tomentosa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed forests.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and human-altered landscapes.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species that may compete with native vegetation in certain regions.</p>
