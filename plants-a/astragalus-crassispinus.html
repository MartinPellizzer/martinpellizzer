                    <h1>Astragalus crassispinus</h1>
<p>Astragalus crassispinus, commonly known as the rough-hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, branched stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is well adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Astragalus crassispinus plays a role in stabilizing soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems.</p>
