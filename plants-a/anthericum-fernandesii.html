                    <h1>Anthericum fernandesii</h1>
<p>Anthericum fernandesii, commonly known as the Cape Verde anthericum, is a rare and endemic fern found primarily in the Cape Verde Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
