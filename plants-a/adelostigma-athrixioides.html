                <h1>Adelostigma athrixioides</h1>
<p>Adelostigma athrixioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap air and aid in buoyancy. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are narrow and often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>Adelostigma athrixioides is an important component of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelostigma athrixioides has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases small, winged seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelostigma athrixioides is primarily native to Mozambique.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the coastal regions of the country, particularly in areas with sandy soils and dune environments. It thrives in the warm, tropical climate characteristic of Mozambique's coastal zones. The species is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of this region, including seasonal rainfall patterns and high temperatures.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing dune systems and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelostigma athrixioides was mainly introduced to areas with suitable moist, shaded habitats, often near streams or in forest understories.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures, making it common in tropical and subtropical environments. The plant is typically found in lowland areas but can occasionally occur in higher elevations where conditions remain favorable. Its introduction has been documented in several regions outside its native range, often due to human activity such as horticulture or accidental transport.</p>
<p>Despite its adaptability, it remains relatively rare in many areas where it is not native.</p>
