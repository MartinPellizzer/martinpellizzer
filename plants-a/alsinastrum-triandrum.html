                    <h1>Alsinastrum triandrum</h1>
<p>Alsinastrum triandrum, commonly known as goatweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in whorled clusters along the stem. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, making it a common weed in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it both a resilient and sometimes problematic species in its native habitats.</p>
