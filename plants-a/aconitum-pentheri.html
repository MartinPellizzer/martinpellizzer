                <h1>Aconitum pentheri</h1>
<p>Aconitum pentheri, commonly known as the Himalayan monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple. The plant has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Aconitum pentheri thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum pentheri has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with serrated edges and a palmate base.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and typically green to reddish-brown, growing in a straight, unbranched pattern. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petals and a spurred structure, blooming in late summer and attracting pollinators like bees through nectar. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through a narrow opening, with the seeds being dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum pentheri is primarily native to Bulgaria, Greece, and the northwest Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in mountainous regions and alpine habitats within these areas. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in meadows and rocky slopes. The species is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic locations, reflecting its adaptation to the local climate and terrain.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum pentheri was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shady habitats such as forest floors and stream banks. This plant was introduced as an ornamental due to its attractive blue to purple flowers. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its spread is a concern for local ecosystems due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
