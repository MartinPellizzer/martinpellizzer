                <h1>Acer fulvescens subsp. fupingense</h1>
<p>Acer fulvescens subsp.</p>
<p>fupingense, commonly known as the Fuping maple, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras with winged seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer fulvescens subsp.</p>
<p>fupingense has palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-7 cm in diameter, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside. The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and often exhibits a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, with a wind pollination method. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to its natural habitat in mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer fulvescens subsp.</p>
<p>fupingense is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of central China, specifically in Sichuan and Hubei provinces. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is typically found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters. The species grows in temperate climates with high humidity and moderate rainfall, often in shaded undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to habitat fragmentation and limited natural reproduction, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer fulvescens subsp.</p>
<p>fupingense is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and adaptability to various climates. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seed propagation requiring stratification to break dormancy.</p>
<p>The growth cycle of this species includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by a dormant phase in winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and health are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or fungal issues in wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants like legumes can enhance its growth and soil health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer fulvescens subsp.</p>
<p>fupingense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health.</p>
<p>The tree acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing soil stability and promoting the growth of other plant species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that holds soil in place.</p>
<p>Additionally, its presence supports ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer fulvescens subsp.</p>
<p>fupingense is a lesser-known maple species native to China, primarily valued for its ecological role in forest ecosystems. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.</p>
<p>In terms of industrial and economic use, it contributes to biodiversity and may support local wildlife, though it lacks significant commercial value. Culturally, it holds symbolic meaning in its native regions, often representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its role in conservation and habitat restoration highlights its importance in maintaining ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer fulvescens subsp.</p>
<p>fupingense has a number of popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, such as 'Crimson Queen' and 'Coralç„°', which display vibrant autumn colors. It is also involved in the creation of hybrids with other maple species, contributing to the diversity of ornamental maples in horticulture.</p>
<p>These cultivars and hybrids are often used in landscaping for their striking foliage and adaptability to various climates. The species holds significant horticultural importance due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in urban environments.</p>
<p>Its varieties are increasingly sought after by gardeners and landscapers looking to add unique visual interest to their gardens.</p>
