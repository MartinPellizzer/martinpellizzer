                <h1>Amelanchier florida</h1>
<p>Amelanchier florida, commonly known as the flowering serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It produces showy white to pink flowers in early spring, often before its leaves emerge, making it a notable early bloomer. The plant has oval, serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall, adding to its seasonal appeal. Its fruit, a small red berry, ripens in late summer and is edible, though typically not as palatable as other serviceberry species.</p>
<p>Amelanchier florida thrives in full sun to partial shade and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits.</p>
