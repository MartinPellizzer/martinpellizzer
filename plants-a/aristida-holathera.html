                    <h1>Aristida holathera</h1>
<p>Aristida holathera, commonly known as the narrowleaf threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky soils, and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture, and its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its ecological role in stabilizing soils.</p>
<p>The species is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
