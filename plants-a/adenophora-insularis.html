                <h1>Adenophora insularis</h1>
<p>Adenophora insularis, commonly known as the island bellflower, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale blue. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are usually lance-shaped with serrated edges. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Adenophora insularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora insularis has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and measure approximately 5-8 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a light green color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in umbels, and range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora insularis is primarily native to the island of Jeju in South Korea.</p>
<p>It is found in the unique volcanic and coastal environments of Jeju Island. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soil and moderate climate conditions. It is often associated with rocky and grassy habitats on the island.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora insularis was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate precipitation and full to partial sunlight. This plant is typically found in regions such as parts of East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. Its introduction to new habitats has sometimes led to it becoming naturalized in areas outside its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in horticultural practices.</p>
