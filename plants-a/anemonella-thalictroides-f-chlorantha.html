                    <h1>Anemonella thalictroides f. chlorantha</h1>
<p>Anemonella thalictroides f. chlorantha, commonly known as the green-flowered anemonella, is a rare and striking variant of the Anemonella thalictroides species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique greenish-yellow flowers, which stand out from the typical white or yellow blooms of the species. This form is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in alpine or subalpine regions. The plant has a low-growing habit with slender, hairy stems and small, heart-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its distinct coloration and its role in the ecological diversity of its native habitats.</p>
