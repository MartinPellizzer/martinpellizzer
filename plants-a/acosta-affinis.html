                <h1>Acosta affinis</h1>
<p>Acosta affinis, commonly known as the Mexican goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Acosta affinis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta affinis has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white in color, with five petals and stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta affinis is primarily native to the high Andean regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate to cool climates at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters above sea level. This plant is commonly found in rocky soils and open grasslands within these mountainous areas. It is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of the Andes, including strong winds and limited soil nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Acosta affinis is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta affinis was mainly introduced to new habitats in regions with similar ecological conditions to its native range, such as moist, well-drained soils in shaded or partially shaded areas.</p>
<p>It has been observed spreading in disturbed sites, including along trails, near water sources, and in urban green spaces. The plant's adaptability to varying light and soil conditions has contributed to its successful establishment in non-native areas. It is often found in the understory of forests or in rocky crevices where it can thrive with minimal competition.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential in some regions remains a topic of ongoing ecological study.</p>
