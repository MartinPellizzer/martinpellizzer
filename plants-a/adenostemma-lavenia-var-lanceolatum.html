<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma lavenia var. lanceolatum has lanceolate-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in spikes, ranging in color from pink to purple, blooming from summer to autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>
