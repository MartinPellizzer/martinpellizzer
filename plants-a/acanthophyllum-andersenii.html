                        <h1>Acanthophyllum andersenii</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum andersenii, commonly known as the Anderson's jointfoot, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub with small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
