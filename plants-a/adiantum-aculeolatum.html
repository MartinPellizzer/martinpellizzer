                <h1>Adiantum aculeolatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum aculeolatum, commonly known as the needle fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green and have a finely divided, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups known as indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Adiantum aculeolatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum aculeolatum has delicate, fern-like leaves that are bi-lobed, with a narrow, linear shape and a finely toothed margin.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged in a feather-like pattern along the stem, which is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves; it does not produce true flowers, so pollination is not applicable. The plant does not have fruits or seeds, as it reproduces via spores released from the sori.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum aculeolatum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded, moist environments like forests and along stream banks. This fern thrives in humid climates and is typically associated with limestone substrates. It is also present in some regions of Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes both terrestrial and epiphytic growth forms.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum aculeolatum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its delicate, fern-like foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and greenhouses where it is cultivated for its aesthetic appeal. The plant is native to South America but has been introduced to various regions worldwide, including parts of the United States and Europe. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens and shaded rockeries.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns in some areas due to its potential to become invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
