<p>Arachnorchis longicauda subsp.</p>
<p>australora, commonly known as the Southern Ghost Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like stems and small, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in rainforest understoreys, where it forms symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its flowers are pollinated by nocturnal insects, such as moths, which are attracted by its subtle scent.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
