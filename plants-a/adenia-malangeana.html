<p>Adenia malangeana, commonly known as the Malangea adenium, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often lobed or deeply divided. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive structure that attracts pollinators like birds and insects.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia malangeana has compound, pinnate leaves that are generally elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement, varying in size from 10 to 20 centimeters in length, and exhibit a glossy texture. The stem is woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels off in thin strips, and it grows upright with a somewhat branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with yellow petals and a prominent green calyx, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a fleshy capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>

<p>Adenia malangeana is primarily native to Angola.</p>
<p>It is found in the central and western regions of the country. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within dense forests. It is often associated with humid and tropical climates.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Angola.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia malangeana was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Queensland.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforest or wetland habitats. The plant is valued for its ornamental value due to its striking purple flowers and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens. It has also been introduced to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands for horticultural purposes.</p>
<p>However, its spread outside its native range is limited due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
