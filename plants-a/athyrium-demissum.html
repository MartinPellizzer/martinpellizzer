<p>Athyrium demissum, commonly known as the golden hakea, is a fern native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, arching fronds with a distinctive golden hue on the underside, which becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Athyrium demissum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
