                <h1>Adamanthus quitensis</h1>
<p>Adamanthus quitensis, commonly known as the Andean flame tree, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, pointed leaflets and produces woody pods that contain seeds. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to cool, temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adamanthus quitensis has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate leaflets that are typically green and have a slightly glossy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale gray bark that exfoliates in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after splitting open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamanthus quitensis is primarily native to the dry valleys and mountainous regions of northern Chile.</p>
<p>It is found in the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on Earth, where it has adapted to extreme arid conditions. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen growing along rocky outcrops and in sparse vegetation areas. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats that provide minimal water and harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamanthus quitensis was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in regions with warm and humid climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical environments. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun exposure, making it suitable for both garden and landscape settings.</p>
<p>Its introduction has expanded its habitat range, contributing to its popularity among horticulturists and garden enthusiasts.</p>
