                    <h1>Ajuga controversa</h1>
<p>Ajuga controversa, commonly known as broadleaf bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with oval, dark green leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in late spring, which are clustered in spikes at the ends of its stems. Ajuga controversa thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a valuable groundcover and a potential weed in certain habitats.</p>
