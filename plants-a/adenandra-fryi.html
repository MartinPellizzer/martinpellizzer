                <h1>Adenandra fryi</h1>
<p>Adenandra fryi, commonly known as the Cape chestnut, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and showy, yellow flowers. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Adenandra fryi is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in coastal environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra fryi has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small, spherical berry that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra fryi is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Malawi.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal forests and moist woodlands where it thrives in humid conditions. This plant is often associated with the coastal areas of KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape provinces in South Africa. Adenandra fryi is also present in parts of Madagascar, where it grows in similar tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes areas with well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a characteristic species of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra fryi was mainly introduced to coastal and lowland areas of eastern Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils and moist environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as New South Wales and Queensland, often growing near the edges of forests and in disturbed habitats. This plant has been introduced to these areas as part of ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and adaptability. However, it has also become naturalized in some regions, raising concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the eastern seaboard, with limited records in other parts of Australia.</p>
