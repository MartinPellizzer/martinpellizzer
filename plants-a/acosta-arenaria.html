                <h1>Acosta arenaria</h1>
<p>Acosta arenaria, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in some areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta arenaria has small, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a grayish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and upright, with a reddish-brown bark that is smooth and somewhat woody. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta arenaria is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas with sandy or gravelly soils. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed or open habitats. It is also present in parts of Nevada and Oregon.</p>
<p>Acosta arenaria is well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta arenaria was mainly introduced to coastal dunes and sandy soils in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and high salinity, where it thrives in nutrient-poor conditions. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats, such as those affected by human activity or natural erosion. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities in invaded areas.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete local flora.</p>
