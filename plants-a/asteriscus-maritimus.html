<p>Asteriscus maritimus, commonly known as the sea aster, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, star-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salty, windy environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Asteriscus maritimus plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small insects and birds.</p>
