                    <h1>Angraecum englerianum</h1>
<p>Angraecum englerianum, commonly known as the Engler's star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and its most notable feature, a sparsely hairy, white or pale green flower spike that can reach several feet in length. The plant produces fragrant, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a unique structure that attracts specific pollinators, such as the hawkmoth. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or botanical gardens.</p>
