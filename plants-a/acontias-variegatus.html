<p>It is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with variegated patterns of green and white. The plant produces small, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>Acontias variegatus prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acontias variegatus has leaves that are ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a variegated color pattern of green and white.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a reddish-brown color, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with a yellowish-white color, blooming during the spring season, and are pollinated primarily by wind.
