<p>Alsophila persquamulifera, commonly known as the broad-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive trunk covered in persistent, overlapping scales that give it a rugged appearance. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, creating a delicate, lacy texture.</p>
<p>Alsophila persquamulifera thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical rainforests.</p>
