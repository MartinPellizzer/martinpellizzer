                <h1>Achyranthes pungens</h1>
<p>Achyranthes pungens, commonly known as the spiny sida, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Achyranthes pungens is known for its prickly stems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes pungens has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and reddish-brown in color, with a growth pattern that is mostly upright and branching. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with a greenish-white color, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes pungens is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands, likely due to human introduction. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils in lowland areas, often near streams or in forest understories. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>While it is not currently listed as endangered, its habitat is threatened by deforestation and land-use changes, which may impact its long-term survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achyranthes pungens is a hardy, fast-growing plant commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, known for its vibrant, spiky flowers and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or division, with seeds requiring stratification for better germination. The growth cycle of Achyranthes pungens is typically seasonal, with active growth during warm months and dormancy in cooler periods.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to encourage bushier growth are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>
