                <h1>Achyranthes pungens</h1>
<p>Achyranthes pungens, commonly known as the spiny knotweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant features erect, branched stems that are often covered with stiff, spiny hairs. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and typically have a rough texture.</p>
<p>The small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and the plant produces dry, three-lobed fruits that contain one or two seeds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes pungens has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually 5-10 cm long, with a glossy green color and serrated margins.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with greenish-white petals, and bloom from spring to summer; they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes pungens is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and wetlands. This plant is commonly found in regions with high humidity and well-drained to moderately wet soil. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be seen growing along riverbanks and in cultivated areas.</p>
<p>Its native range extends to some parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes pungens was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its striking red flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the North Island, where it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Despite its beauty, it is considered a potential weed in some areas because of its ability to spread rapidly. The plant is often found along roadsides, in pasturelands, and in forest margins.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
