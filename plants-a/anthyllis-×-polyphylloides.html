                    <h1>Anthyllis × polyphylloides</h1>
<p>Anthyllis × polyphylloides, commonly known as the hybrid sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Anthyllis vulneraria and Anthyllis cytisoides, resulting in a plant with intermediate characteristics. The species features small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and its leaves are trifoliate, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
