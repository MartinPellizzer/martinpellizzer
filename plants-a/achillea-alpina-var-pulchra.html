                <h1>Achillea alpina var. pulchra</h1>
<p>Achillea alpina var. pulchra, commonly known as the Alpine Chrysanthemum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, gray-green foliage and produces clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is well adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. It is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardy nature and ornamental value.</p>
<p>The variety pulchra is distinguished by its more compact growth and showy floral display compared to the typical form.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina var. pulchra has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a grayish-blue color and a fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark and a growth pattern that is clumping, forming dense clusters. Its flowers are flat-topped umbels composed of small, white to pale yellow florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina var. pulchra is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly the Alps and Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>While it was originally found in these areas, its current distribution includes parts of Central and Eastern Europe, often in disturbed or open habitats. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes, meadows, and grasslands. This plant is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes warrant continued monitoring for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina var. pulchra is a hardy perennial known for its vibrant, daisy-like flowers and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a biennial growth cycle, though it often behaves as a short-lived perennial in colder climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with reduced irrigation during the dormant season. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender, yarrow, or echinacea can enhance its beauty and provide beneficial interactions in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina var. pulchra is a hardy plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both nectar and shelter in its dense foliage. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved soil conditions. It also helps with erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil in rocky or sandy areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity of its habitat by supporting a range of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea alpina var. pulchra is a decorative plant commonly used in ornamental gardening for its attractive, fluffy flower heads and drought-tolerant nature.</p>
