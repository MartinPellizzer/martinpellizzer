<p>Adenocalymma imperatoris-maximilianii, commonly known as the bluebell of the desert, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a hairy texture.</p>
<p>It blooms during the cooler months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
