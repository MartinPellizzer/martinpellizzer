                    <h1>Aristolochia cinnabarina</h1>
<p>Aristolochia cinnabarina, commonly known as the red pipevine, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and striking, hooded flowers that range in color from reddish-brown to maroon. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow berries that contain toxic seeds, which are a food source for certain butterfly species. It thrives in woodland habitats and is often found along stream banks and in shaded areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though care must be taken due to its toxic properties.</p>
