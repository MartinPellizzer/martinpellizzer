                    <h1>Acantholimon truncatum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon truncatum, commonly known as the short-fruited sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and dry grasslands. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Acantholimon truncatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
