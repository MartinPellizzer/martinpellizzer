<p>Anguina subvelutina, commonly known as the velvety root weevil, is a small beetle belonging to the family Curculionidae.</p>
<p>It is primarily found in the Mediterranean region and is known for its larvae feeding on the roots of various plants, including some grasses and herbs. The adult beetles are typically less than 5 millimeters in length, with a dark brown to black body covered in fine, velvety hairs. The species plays a role in the natural ecosystem by contributing to the decomposition of plant material.</p>
<p>However, in some cases, it may cause damage to cultivated plants, particularly in agricultural settings.</p>
