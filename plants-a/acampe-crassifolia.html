                        <h1>Acampe crassifolia</h1>
<p>Acampe crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved acampe, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its stems are woody and often branched, providing structural support in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Acampe crassifolia is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acampe crassifolia is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It is typically found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with areas that have low rainfall and high temperatures.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acampe crassifolia was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in coastal and inland areas. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native environments.</p>
