                <h1>Aspidium calcareum</h1>
<p>Aspidium calcareum, commonly known as the limestone shield fern, is a species of fern native to regions with limestone soils.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found on rocky or calcareous substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Aspidium calcareum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
