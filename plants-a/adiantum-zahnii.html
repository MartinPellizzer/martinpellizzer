                <h1>Adiantum zahnii</h1>
<p>Adiantum zahnii, commonly known as the Zahn's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that resemble羽毛. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive rachis that is often slightly zigzagged.</p>
<p>Adiantum zahnii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum zahnii has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a dark green color and a finely serrated margin. They are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender, wiry, and often slightly hairy. The plant does not produce flowers or fruits, as it is a spore-bearing plant, and its reproductive structures are microscopic spores released from sporangia located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizoidal, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum zahnii is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often associated with pine flatwoods and scrub habitats. It is also known to occur in the Caribbean, including the Bahamas and Cuba.</p>
<p>Adiantum zahnii is a rare and endangered species, making its native distribution both geographically and ecologically significant.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum zahnii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along streams. This fern is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, lace-like fronds and ornamental value. Its introduction has led to its presence in both natural and cultivated landscapes.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is grown.</p>
