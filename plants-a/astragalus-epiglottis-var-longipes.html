The plant produces small, oblong pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
