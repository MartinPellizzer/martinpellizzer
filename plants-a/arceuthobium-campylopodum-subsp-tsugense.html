<p>Arceuthobium campylopodum subsp.</p>
<p>tsugense, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily infects coniferous trees such as fir and hemlock. It lacks true roots and instead attaches to its host through a specialized structure called a haustorium, which penetrates the host's tissue to extract nutrients.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous leaves and relies entirely on its host for water and minerals. It spreads through the release of sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of host trees.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its unique reproductive strategy and its role in the ecological dynamics of forest ecosystems.</p>
