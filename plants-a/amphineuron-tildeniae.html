                    <h1>Amphineuron tildeniae</h1>
<p>Amphineuron tildeniae, commonly known as the Tilden's ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its evocative common name. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive strategy, producing spores in specialized structures called sorangia, which are often hidden within the leaf axils. Its growth is slow and requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Amphineuron tildeniae is considered a conservation concern.</p>
