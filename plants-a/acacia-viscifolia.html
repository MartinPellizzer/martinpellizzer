                    <h1>Acacia viscifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia viscifolia, commonly known as the sticky acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in compact clusters. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. Acacia viscifolia is adapted to arid environments and has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of gum arabic.</p>
