                    <h1>Arundo gigantea</h1>
<p>Arundo gigantea, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, hollow stems that can grow up to 6 meters in height, making it a striking ornamental plant. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to yellowish flowers in the summer months. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways due to its preference for moist soils.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it both useful for erosion control and a potential invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
