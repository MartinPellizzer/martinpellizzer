                    <h1>Athyrium hohenackerianum</h1>
<p>Athyrium hohenackerianum, commonly known as the Hohenacker's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>The plant's reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
