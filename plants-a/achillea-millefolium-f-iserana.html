                <h1>Achillea millefolium f. iserana</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. iserana, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a subspecies of the common yarrow.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. The plant features finely divided, feather-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. iserana has leaves that are finely dissected, feathery, and pinnately divided, typically arranged alternately along the stem, with a light green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat hairy, and has a grayish-green color, growing in a clumping pattern. The flowers are compound umbels of small, white to pale yellow florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. iserana is a subspecies of yarrow that is native to the Alps, primarily found in Switzerland, Austria, and southern Germany.</p>
<p>Its current distribution extends to parts of Italy and France, where it thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. It typically grows in rocky soils, meadows, and open slopes, often in areas with high sunlight exposure. This subspecies is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited population size, it is considered a rare and locally threatened species, requiring conservation efforts to protect its natural environment.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. iserana is a hardy perennial plant known for its feathery foliage and delicate yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The growth cycle involves a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding over-saturation. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its beauty and deter pests naturally.</p>
