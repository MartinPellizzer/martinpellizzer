                        <h1>Acer caesium subsp. caesium</h1>
<p>Acer caesium subsp.</p>
<p>caesium, commonly known as the Siberian maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping form and distinctive, palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in autumn.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acer caesium subsp.</p>
<p>caesium belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their primitive vascular structures.</p>
<p>Its subclass is Magnoliidae, which encompasses a diverse group of flowering plants with a wide range of morphological features. Its order is Sapindales, a group of flowering plants that includes trees, shrubs, and some herbs, often with showy flowers. Its family is Sapindaceae, commonly known as the soapberry family, which includes plants with distinctive fruits and often aromatic leaves. Its genus is Acer, which refers to the maple trees, known for their opposite leaf arrangement and often colorful autumn foliage.</p>
<p>Its species is Acer caesium, a specific type of maple native to eastern Asia, characterized by its slender leaves and distinctive fruit structure.</p>
