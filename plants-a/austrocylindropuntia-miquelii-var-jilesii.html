<p>Austrocylindropuntia miquelii var. jilesii, commonly known as the Jiles' cylindrical cactus, is a species native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert environments.</p>
<p>Its structure and adaptations reflect its evolutionary response to harsh, dry climates.</p>
