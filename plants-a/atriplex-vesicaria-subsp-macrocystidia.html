<p>Atriplex vesicaria subsp.</p>
<p>macrocystidia, commonly known as the broad-cystidial saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its large, conspicuous cystidia on the leaf surfaces, which contribute to its unique botanical identity.</p>
