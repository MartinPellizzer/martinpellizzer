                <h1>Adenogramma glomerata</h1>
<p>Adenogramma glomerata, commonly known as the clustered adenogramma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adenogramma glomerata is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as forests or undergrowth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenogramma glomerata has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogramma glomerata is primarily native to the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>It is found in the region's diverse fynbos vegetation, which is characteristic of the area's Mediterranean climate. This plant thrives in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, often in coastal and mountainous areas. It is commonly observed in the western and southern parts of the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>Adenogramma glomerata plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogramma glomerata was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses due to its ornamental value and adaptability. This plant prefers full sun to partial shade and requires regular watering to thrive. It is sometimes used in landscape design for its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is important to manage its growth to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments.</p>
