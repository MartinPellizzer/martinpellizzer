                    <h1>Alchornea sicca</h1>
<p>Alchornea sicca, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its fibrous roots help it survive in poor soil and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Alchornea sicca is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
