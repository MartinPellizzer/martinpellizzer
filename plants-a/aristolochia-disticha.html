<p>Aristolochia disticha, commonly known as the twinleaf Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces unique, tubular flowers that are often purple or greenish in color, with a strong, aromatic odor. These flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insects, such as flies and beetles.</p>
<p>The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been linked to kidney failure, making it important to handle with care.</p>
