                    <h1>Alcantarea abacta</h1>
<p>Alcantarea abacta, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or the red alcantara, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and its striking red to orange inflorescence that emerges from a rosette of broad, waxy leaves. The plant's leaves are often covered in a fine, powdery coating that gives them a unique, almost metallic sheen. Alcantarea abacta thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
