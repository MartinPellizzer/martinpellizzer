<p>Apinagia fluitans, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap microscopic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, often floating on the water surface.</p>
<p>Apinagia fluitans is a carnivorous plant, relying on its bladders to capture and digest prey for nutrients.</p>
