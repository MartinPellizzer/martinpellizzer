<p>Arenaria baldaccii, commonly known as the Mediterranean sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky and sandy soils of southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, needle-like leaves and produces clusters of pale blue or purple flowers in early summer. The plant is well adapted to arid conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry environments. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
