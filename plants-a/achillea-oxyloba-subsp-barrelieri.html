                <h1>Achillea oxyloba subsp. barrelieri</h1>
<p>Achillea oxyloba subsp.</p>
<p>barrelieri, commonly known as Barrelier's yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a valuable addition to alpine gardens.</p>
<p>It is also noted for its medicinal properties, historically used for its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea oxyloba subsp.</p>
<p>barrelieri has basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate, arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-gray color due to dense pubescence, and a length of about 5â€“10 cm. The stem is upright, hairy, and slightly reddish-brown, with a branching pattern that is somewhat sparsely branched.</p>
<p>The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a cypsela, which is dispersed by wind due to its pappus structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea oxyloba subsp.</p>
<p>barrelieri is a rare flowering plant native to the high mountain regions of the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in southern Spain. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations in Andalusia, where it thrives in rocky and gravelly soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as slopes and cliffs, often at elevations between 600 and 1,200 meters. Due to its restricted range and habitat degradation, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve this unique subspecies in its natural environment.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea oxyloba subsp.</p>
<p>barrelieri is a low-growing, drought-tolerant perennial known for its fluffy, pinkish-white flowers and aromatic foliage. It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing the plant in early spring.</p>
<p>This plant has a short growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and completing its life cycle within a single growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, preferring full sun to partial shade. Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its compact form, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender, rosemary, or thyme enhances its ornamental value and repels pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea oxyloba subsp.</p>
<p>barrelieri is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, which rely on its flowers for sustenance.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and supporting a wide range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea oxyloba subsp.</p>
<p>barrelieri is a lesser-known plant with limited documented uses, primarily found in specific regions of southern Africa. It has not been widely utilized in culinary applications due to a lack of traditional or modern culinary integration.</p>
<p>In medicinal contexts, it may have potential for local use, though scientific research on its therapeutic properties is sparse. Industrially, it does not play a significant role in economic sectors, as it is not cultivated for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic value in the communities where it naturally occurs, though this remains underexplored.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea oxyloba subsp.</p>
<p>barrelieri has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Fascination' and 'Pink Lemonade,' which showcase vibrant, long-lasting flowers. This subspecies is also used in hybrid breeding programs to enhance traits such as color, disease resistance, and adaptability to different climates.</p>
<p>Its hybrids often combine the hardiness of Achillea species with the unique foliage and floral characteristics of barrelieri. Horticulturally, it is valued for its ability to thrive in sunny, well-drained soils and its role in attracting pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements, it is a favored choice for gardeners and landscapers seeking drought-tolerant plants.</p>
