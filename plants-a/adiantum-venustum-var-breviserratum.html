                    <h1>Adiantum venustum var. breviserratum</h1>
<p>Adiantum venustum var. breviserratum, commonly known as the narrow-serrated maidenhair fern, is a striking fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are dark green and finely divided, with a distinctive narrow serration along the leaf edges. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and thrives in well-draining, humus-rich soil. It is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Adiantum genus.</p>
