<p>Acacia lycopodioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features small, narrow leaves arranged in a compact, dense manner, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in spherical heads, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Acacia lycopodioides is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
