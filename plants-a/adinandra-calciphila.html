                <h1>Adinandra calciphila</h1>
<p>Adinandra calciphila, commonly known as the limestone rock heath, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and is adapted to grow in rocky, calcium-rich soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are small, leathery, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Adinandra calciphila is often found in limestone formations and is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra calciphila has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5-10 cm long and 2-4 cm wide, arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant ages. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the wet season, which are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra calciphila is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. It is typically associated with limestone substrates, which are common in parts of Borneo. The species is part of the Dipterocarpaceae family, which is well-represented in the region's diverse flora.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Adinandra calciphila is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra calciphila was mainly introduced to rocky and limestone habitats in Southeast Asia, particularly in Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in disturbed or secondary forests. The plant is adapted to high light conditions and can tolerate drought, making it resilient in harsh environments. Its introduction has been documented in conservation areas where it contributes to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited due to its specific ecological requirements.</p>
