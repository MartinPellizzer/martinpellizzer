                <h1>Acer douglasii</h1>
<p>Acer douglasii, commonly known as the Douglas maple, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, red flowers in the spring, which are followed by winged fruits. It typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters and has a broad, rounded canopy.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow furrows that become more pronounced as the tree matures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer douglasii has leaves that are palmately lobed, typically with five to seven pointed lobes, and are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are medium-sized, usually 5–10 cm in diameter, with a bright green upper surface and a pale, hairy underside, turning red or orange in the fall. The stem is slender and grows upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky soils in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer douglasii is a species of maple native to the western United States, specifically found in regions of Oregon, California, and Nevada.</p>
<p>While its native range was once broader, its current distribution is more limited due to habitat loss and environmental changes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in coniferous forests and mountainous areas. This species typically grows at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat fragmentation and threats from climate change, Acer douglasii is listed as a species of concern in some areas, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer douglasii is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period to break dormancy. The growth cycle of Acer douglasii involves slow initial growth followed by steady development, reaching maturity in 10–20 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture levels, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches promotes healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally suffer from aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer douglasii is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers and produces berries that serve as a food source for birds. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, especially on slopes and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer douglasii contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality through photosynthesis.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer douglasii is a species of maple native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its seeds and leaves can be used in traditional herbal remedies. The wood of Acer douglasii is strong and durable, making it suitable for industrial and economic purposes such as furniture and cabinetry. It holds cultural significance among indigenous communities, who may use it in ceremonial practices or as a symbol of resilience.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer douglasii plays a vital role in local ecosystems and has limited but meaningful applications in various fields.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer douglasii has several popular cultivars, including 'Purpureum' and 'Variegatum', which are prized for their striking foliage colors and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>It also has been used in hybridization with other maple species, such as Acer palmatum, to create ornamental varieties with enhanced ornamental features. These hybrids often exhibit improved cold hardiness and unique leaf patterns, making them more adaptable to various garden conditions. Due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability, Acer douglasii holds significant horticultural importance in both landscape design and botanical collections.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids contribute to the diversity of maple trees available for cultivation in temperate climates.</p>
