<p>Arenaria rotundifolia subsp.</p>
<p>pancicii, commonly known as the Pancici's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-forming structure and small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
