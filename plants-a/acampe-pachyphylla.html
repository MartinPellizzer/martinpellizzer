                    <h1>Acampe pachyphylla</h1>
<p>Acampe pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved acampe, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, adding a subtle beauty to its environment. Its growth habit is typically low and compact, forming a dense mat that helps prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant.</p>
