                <h1>Actinidia dielsii</h1>
<p>Actinidia dielsii, commonly known as the Chinese mayapple, is a deciduous climbing vine native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Actinidiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia dielsii has alternate, simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 5â€“10 cm in length, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside, and a dark green color on top and lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a climbing vine with tendrils. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in axillary inflorescences, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a yellow to orange berry that matures in late summer, dispersing by birds and mammals through ingestion and excretion.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia dielsii is primarily native to China, specifically the provinces of Yunnan, Sichuan, and Hubei.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous regions at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This plant thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often found in dense forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes areas with mild winters and cool summers, making it a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia dielsii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, temperate forests and along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and edible berries. It has been introduced to gardens and naturalized areas in several states.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
