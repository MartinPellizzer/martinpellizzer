                        <h1>Abutilon lilloi</h1>
<p>Abutilon lilloi, commonly known as the Lillo's abutilon, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Abutilon lilloi is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon lilloi is primarily native to Argentina, specifically the provinces of Buenos Aires and La Pampa.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Uruguay and southern Brazil. This plant thrives in grassland and shrubland habitats, often in areas with well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with the Monte desert and adjacent regions.</p>
<p>Abutilon lilloi is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the semi-arid climate of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon lilloi was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there by horticulturalists or botanists interested in cultivating exotic species for gardens and landscapes. Despite its aesthetic value, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction have contributed to its success in non-native habitats.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now underway to control its spread and protect native plant communities.</p>
