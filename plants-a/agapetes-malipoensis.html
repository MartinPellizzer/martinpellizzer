<p>Agapetes malipoensis, commonly known as the Malipo silverleaf, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, edible berries that are favored by certain bird species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Agapetes malipoensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
