<p>Aspidium californicum, commonly known as the California water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
