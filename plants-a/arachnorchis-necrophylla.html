                    <h1>Arachnorchis necrophylla</h1>
<p>Arachnorchis necrophylla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive terrestrial orchid native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that resemble spider-like structures, hence its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests or under dense vegetation. It has a unique mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is often difficult to find in the wild.</p>
