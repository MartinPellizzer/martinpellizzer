<p>Ascogrammitis cuencana, commonly known as the Cuencan hill fern, is a species of fern native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across suitable habitats.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually green and have a leathery texture, which helps in water retention in its native environment.</p>
