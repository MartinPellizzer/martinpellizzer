                    <h1>Asplenium decorum</h1>
<p>Asplenium decorum, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a compact evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features intricate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive golden hue on the underside, which becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and thrives in rich, well-draining soil. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium decorum is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in humid, indoor conditions.</p>
