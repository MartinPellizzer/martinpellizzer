<p>Aralia quinquefolia var. elegantior, commonly known as the elegant arum, is a variant of the American arum.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States, characterized by its compound leaves that are more refined and less lobed than the typical aralia. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in a spadix surrounded by a spathe. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive, palmate leaves.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its upright growth habit and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
