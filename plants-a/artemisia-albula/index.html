                            <h1>Artemisia Albula</h1>
<p>Alba artemisia, scientifically known as Artemisia albula, is a hardy shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. This plant is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and aromatic, slightly fuzzy leaves that emit a distinct, minty scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping and rocky gardens. With its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal, Artemisia albula is a popular plant among gardeners seeking low-maintenance, drought-tolerant species. Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent further highlights its cultural and practical significance.</p>
