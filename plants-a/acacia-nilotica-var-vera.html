                        <h1>Acacia nilotica var. vera</h1>
<p>Acacia nilotica var. vera, commonly known as the pale acacia, is a flowering plant native to Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in cylindrical spikes, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>The pale acacia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in medicine and as a source of gum arabic.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia nilotica var. vera is primarily native to the Horn of Africa, including countries such as Somalia, Ethiopia, and Eritrea.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in Yemen and Oman. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in dry savannas and along riverbanks. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its distribution extends into some areas of northern Sudan and southern Egypt.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia nilotica var. vera was mainly introduced to South Africa as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and drought-resistant properties.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats, including roadsides and disturbed soils. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in arid conditions have led to its establishment in natural ecosystems. It is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its ecological impact and management in invaded areas.</p>
