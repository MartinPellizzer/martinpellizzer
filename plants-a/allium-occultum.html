                    <h1>Allium occultum</h1>
<p>Allium occultum, commonly known as the hidden garlic, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Allium genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bulbous structure and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its flowers are usually pale purple or white, arranged in a loose cluster at the top of the stem.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is rarely cultivated.</p>
