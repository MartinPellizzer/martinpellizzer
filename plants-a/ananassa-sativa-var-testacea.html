<p>Ananassa sativa var. testacea, commonly known as the testacean pineapple, is a rare and ornamental variant of the pineapple plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale yellow to white bracts that resemble a shell, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically hidden beneath the leafy bracts. Its leaves are long, grass-like, and have a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>This variety is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for fruit production.</p>
