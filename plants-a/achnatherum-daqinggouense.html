<p>Achnatherum daqinggouense, commonly known as the Daqinggouense needlegrass, is a species of grass native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets.</p>
<p>Achnatherum daqinggouense is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum daqinggouense has narrow, linear leaves that are typically grass-like in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a slightly rough texture and a pale green to yellowish color, growing upright and branching sparingly. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets with small, two-lipped flowers that are pale yellow to greenish in color, blooming in early summer, and are wind-pollinated.
