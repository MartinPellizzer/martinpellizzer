                <h1>Acer assyriacum</h1>
<p>Acer assyriacum, commonly known as the Persian maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 5â€“10 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer assyriacum has palmately compound leaves that are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged on petioles that emerge from a common point.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a serrated margin, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a shrub-like growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer assyriacum is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the eastern Mediterranean region, including parts of Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited, with scattered populations primarily in Turkey and Syria. It thrives in rocky, limestone soils in open or semi-shaded environments, often growing in mountainous regions. This species typically occurs at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Acer assyriacum is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer assyriacum is a deciduous shrub known for its delicate, lace-like leaves and vibrant fall color, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or stem cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The plant has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in 5 to 7 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and regular watering, especially during dry periods, but is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune after flowering to maintain shape and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or heathers can enhance its aesthetic appeal and create a diverse garden habitat.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer assyriacum is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy white flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of nearby flora. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
