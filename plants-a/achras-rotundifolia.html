                <h1>Achras rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Achras rotundifolia, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, round, waxy leaves and produces a fruit that is central to its ecological and economic significance. The fruit, which resembles a small bread loaf, is botanically classified as a syncarp, formed from the fusion of multiple berries. The tree's trunk is typically smooth and often develops a distinctive swollen base.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, humid climates and is well adapted to coastal and lowland environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras rotundifolia has large, thick, waxy, round leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a bluish-green color and a diameter ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and grows from the base of the plant. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a panicle, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a large, spiny, orange-red berry that contains numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb water from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras rotundifolia is primarily native to the Caribbean, including parts of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is also found in southern Florida, particularly in the Florida Keys. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in coastal areas and mangrove swamps. It is commonly associated with disturbed soils and can be found in both natural and human-modified habitats.</p>
<p>Its native range extends to parts of Central America, where it is often seen in dry forest environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras rotundifolia was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region for its ornamental value and as a potential source of latex.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun. The plant's rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas have led to its classification as an invasive species in some regions. Due to its ecological impact, it is often regulated in areas where it threatens native flora.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range, raising concerns about its environmental effects.</p>
