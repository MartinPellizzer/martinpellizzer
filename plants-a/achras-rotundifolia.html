                <h1>Achras rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Achras rotundifolia, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a dense canopy and smooth, grayish bark. The plant produces large, round fruits that are typically harvested when they are still green, though they can ripen to a yellowish color. Its leaves are broad, palmate, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicles.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its nutritional fruit, which is rich in carbohydrates and used as a staple food in many island cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras rotundifolia has large, round, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a diameter of up to 30 cm, and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. It produces showy, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the dry season, with a structure that includes both male and female parts, and it is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a fleshy, red berry that splits open to release small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant to anchor itself and access water in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras rotundifolia is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the islands of Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is now also cultivated in other tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of southern Florida and the Mediterranean. This species thrives in coastal dunes, dry forests, and sandy soils, often near the shorelines. It typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 100 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Achras rotundifolia is considered a species of concern and is listed as vulnerable in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras rotundifolia is a slow-growing, evergreen shrub that thrives in warm, tropical climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining desirable traits. The plant has a long growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity and produce its characteristic white, fleshy fruit.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering that can lead to root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to maintain shape and encourage fruiting are essential. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally be affected by scale insects or fungal infections.</p>
<p>Companion planting with citrus or legumes can help improve soil health and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achras rotundifolia is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and mammals.</p>
