                <h1>Acokanthera deflersii</h1>
<p>Acokanthera deflersii, commonly known as the poison arrow tree, is a flowering plant native to eastern and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree that produces fragrant, white or greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its toxic properties, as its leaves and stems contain cardiac glycosides, which are potent poisons. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Despite its dangerous nature, it plays a role in traditional medicine and has cultural significance in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acokanthera deflersii has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as an erect shrub or small tree. Its flowers are clustered in umbels, featuring five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera deflersii is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, Mozambique, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry woodlands, savannas, and rocky areas, often growing in regions with well-drained soils. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is typically found at elevations ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level. It is known for its toxic properties and is sometimes referred to as "poison arrow tree" due to its historical use in making poison for hunting.</p>
<p>The species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting local wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera deflersii was mainly introduced to the African continent, particularly in regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe. This plant is often associated with traditional medicine due to its toxic properties. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is typically found in savanna and woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has had both ecological and cultural impacts in the regions where it is now established.</p>
