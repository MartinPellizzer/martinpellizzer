<p>This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found in savanna and grassland ecosystems. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can tolerate high temperatures. The species is often seen growing along riverbanks and in rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to areas with low rainfall and sparse vegetation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia tetragonocarpa var. scabra was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to stabilize soil. It also serves as a valuable source of browse for livestock and wildlife.</p>
