                    <h1>Angraecopsis adoxa</h1>
<p>Angraecopsis adoxa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to the arid regions of southern Africa, it is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale, translucent petals. The plant typically grows on rock faces or in crevices, relying on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
