                    <h1>Antennaria montana</h1>
<p>Antennaria montana, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It has a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces delicate white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a raceme. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Antennaria montana is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for early pollinators.</p>
