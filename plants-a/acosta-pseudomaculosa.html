                <h1>Acosta pseudomaculosa</h1>
<p>Acosta pseudomaculosa, commonly known as the spotted acosta, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive spotted leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments and can reach heights of up to two meters. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with five petals and a prominent central stigma.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and showy blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta pseudomaculosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly pubescent upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to anchor itself in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta pseudomaculosa is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodland areas. This plant typically grows in the coastal regions and mountainous areas of these states. It prefers cool, humid climates and is often seen along streams and in riparian zones.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited, making it a rare and specialized species in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta pseudomaculosa was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has established itself in various regions, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. The plant's introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness due to its rapid growth and adaptability. It is often found in disturbed habitats, including roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>Its spread highlights the need for monitoring and management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
