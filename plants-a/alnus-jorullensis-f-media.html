                    <h1>Alnus jorullensis f. media</h1>
<p>Alnus jorullensis f. media, commonly known as the dwarf alder, is a shrub-like variant of the alder genus native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or near water sources.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
