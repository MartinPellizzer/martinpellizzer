<p>Anthericum leptophyllum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clumps, and its most striking characteristic is its showy, spike-like inflorescence composed of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, three-lobed berries that are dispersed by water, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects.</p>
