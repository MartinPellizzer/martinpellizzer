                <h1>Adicea corymbosa</h1>
<p>Adicea corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clusters of bell-shaped, violet or blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds.</p>
<p>Adicea corymbosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea corymbosa has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a smooth surface and a glossy green color, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat woody, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes rougher with age. The flowers are small, clustered in corymbs, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea corymbosa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and moist lowland areas. This plant thrives in humid climates with ample sunlight and well-drained soil. It is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Adicea corymbosa plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea corymbosa was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, typically in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along stream banks. The plant thrives in environments with moderate temperatures and adequate moisture throughout the growing season. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several non-native regions, often outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
