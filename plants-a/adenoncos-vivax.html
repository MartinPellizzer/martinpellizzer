                <h1>Adenoncos vivax</h1>
<p>Adenoncos vivax, commonly known as the hardy milkweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are typically followed by seed pods containing tufts of silky hair, aiding in wind dispersal. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Adenoncos vivax is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenoncos vivax has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a climbing growth pattern. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in axillary inflorescences, featuring white petals with a yellow center, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoncos vivax is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within lowland and hill forests. This plant is commonly found in areas with rich organic soil and high rainfall. Its distribution extends to parts of the Pacific Islands as well.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoncos vivax was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as trade and land modification.</p>
<p>It has been documented in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats, making it a common invader in agricultural and urban areas. Its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species pose a threat to local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts to control its spread have been limited due to its adaptability and widespread distribution.</p>
