                <h1>Adenostemma harlingii</h1>
<p>Adenostemma harlingii, commonly known as Harling's adenostemma, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Adenostemma harlingii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma harlingii has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and exhibits a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern that becomes more complex as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with tubular corollas that are typically pink or purple, blooming during the summer months and being pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and attached parachute-like structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma harlingii is primarily native to Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It is adapted to the warm and humid climate of Ecuador's coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely confined to specific ecological zones within Ecuador.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma harlingii was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries like South Africa, Namibia, and Angola.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and coastal dunes. It has become naturalized in some areas, raising concerns about its potential to invade native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, its introduction has led to ecological impacts in certain regions.</p>
