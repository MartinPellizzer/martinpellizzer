<p>Anthopterus calycinus, commonly known as the rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Anthopterus calycinus is often found in rocky crevices and along dry streambeds, adapting well to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
