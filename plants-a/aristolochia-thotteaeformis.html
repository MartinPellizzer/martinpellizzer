                    <h1>Aristolochia thotteaeformis</h1>
<p>Aristolochia thotteaeformis, commonly known as the Thai pipevine, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, aromatic scent. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its complex, winding floral structure that attracts specific pollinators. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while the stems are woody and can grow攀援 up to several meters in height.</p>
<p>The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been historically used in traditional medicine, though its use is now largely restricted due to health risks.</p>
