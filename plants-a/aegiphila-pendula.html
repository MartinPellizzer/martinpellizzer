                <h1>Aegiphila pendula</h1>
<p>Aegiphila pendula, commonly known as the hanging pellitory, is a herbaceous plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cascading stems that often hang from rocky outcrops or cliffs. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a hairy texture.</p>
<p>Aegiphila pendula is adapted to grow in dry, sunny environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila pendula has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are pink to reddish in color, consisting of five petals and five stamens, and bloom from late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
