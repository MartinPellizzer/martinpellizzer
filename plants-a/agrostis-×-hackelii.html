                    <h1>Agrostis × hackelii</h1>
<p>Agrostis × hackelii, commonly known as the hybrid meadowgrass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis stolonifera.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial grass that forms dense mats and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is widely used in turfgrass applications due to its fine texture and ability to form a dense, durable sod.</p>
<p>However, its sterility limits its natural propagation and reliance on seedlings from its parent species.</p>
