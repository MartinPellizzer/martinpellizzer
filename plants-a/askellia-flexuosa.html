<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist soils. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Askellia flexuosa is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
