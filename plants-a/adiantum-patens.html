                <h1>Adiantum patens</h1>
<p>Adiantum patens, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate and ornamental fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green and turn bronze in the winter. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. It reproduces via spores and is often grown as a houseplant or in shaded garden beds.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and easy care make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum patens has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with slender, thread-like pinnae arranged alternately along the rachis.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically light green, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and they can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant has a short, unbranched stem that is usually covered in a smooth, pale green or brownish bark. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a spore-bearing sorus, dispersing via wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum patens is primarily native to Bolivia, Brazil Northeast, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Gal√°pagos, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico Central, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Northwest, Mexico Southeast, Mexico Southwest, Nicaragua, Peru, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its wide distribution suggests adaptability to various microhabitats within its range.</p>
<p>Adiantum patens is a popular ornamental plant due to its delicate, lace-like fronds.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum patens was mainly introduced to wetlands and streamside areas where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and consistent water availability. This plant is often associated with riparian zones and can be seen growing along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its introduction has been documented in several regions outside its native range, including parts of North America.</p>
<p>Adiantum patens spreads through spores and can form dense colonies, making it a notable species in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
