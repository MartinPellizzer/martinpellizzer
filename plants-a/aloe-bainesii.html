<p>Aloe bainesii, commonly known as the Cape aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear yellow-orange flowers, which bloom in the summer. Aloe bainesii is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of gel for topical applications.</p>
