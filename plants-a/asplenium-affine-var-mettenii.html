<p>Asplenium affine var. mettenii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf maidenhair fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often slightly curled. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is commonly found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions.</p>
