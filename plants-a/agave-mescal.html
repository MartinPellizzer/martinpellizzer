<p>Agave mescal, commonly known as the blue agave, is a species of agave native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that form a rosette shape, and its ability to store water in its succulent structure. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing small white or greenish flowers. Its most valuable part is the core, or pi√±a, which is used to make tequila and other mescal beverages.</p>
