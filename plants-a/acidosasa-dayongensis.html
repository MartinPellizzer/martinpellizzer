                <h1>Acidosasa dayongensis</h1>
<p>Acidosasa dayongensis, commonly known as the Yunnan acacia, is a flowering plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow or pale green flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidosasa dayongensis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a dark green, glossy color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, spherical capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidosasa dayongensis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, temperate climates at high altitudes. This plant is commonly found in forested areas with well-drained soil. It is adapted to the cool and moist conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Acidosasa dayongensis is a rare species with a limited geographic range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidosasa dayongensis was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It has been successfully established in gardens and naturalized areas across parts of North America and Europe. The plant is valued for its ornamental foliage and resilience to environmental stress. Its distribution has expanded due to horticultural interest and accidental spread through wind and water.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas, requiring monitoring to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
