<p>Alysicarpus rubibarna, commonly known as red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fibrous, woody pulp. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in construction and crafting.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
