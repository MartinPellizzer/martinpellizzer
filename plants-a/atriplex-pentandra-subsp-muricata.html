<p>Atriplex pentandra subsp.</p>
<p>muricata, commonly known as the rough saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its hairy, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to saline soils and coastal areas.</p>
<p>The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
