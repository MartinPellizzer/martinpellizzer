                            <h1>Argemone Mexicana Subsp. Ochroleuca</h1>
<p>Argemone mexicana subsp. ochroleuca is a lesser-known variant of the Mexican poppy known for its striking yellow flowers. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It is native to parts of Asia and the Americas, where it has adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions. Despite its beauty, it is also considered a weed in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily. Its unique characteristics make it an interesting subject for botanical study and ecological discussion.</p>
