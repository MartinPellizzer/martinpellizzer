<p>Acanthophyllum transhyrcanum, commonly known as the Transcaspian thorned grass, is a shrub-like plant native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it survive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils. It is adapted to low water availability and can thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Acanthophyllum transhyrcanum plays a significant role in the local flora and is often found in steppe and desert ecosystems.</p>
