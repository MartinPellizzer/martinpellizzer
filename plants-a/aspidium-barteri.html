<p>Aspidium barteri, commonly known as the Barter's water fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread across wetland environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typically in clusters.</p>
<p>Aspidium barteri thrives in moist, shaded areas and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
