                    <h1>Acetosella droseroides</h1>
<p>Acetosella droseroides, commonly known as the sticky catchfly, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance, which can trap small insects.</p>
<p>This adaptation aids in nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments where the plant thrives.</p>
