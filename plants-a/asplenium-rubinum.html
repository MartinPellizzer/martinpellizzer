                    <h1>Asplenium rubinum</h1>
<p>Asplenium rubinum, commonly known as the red hawksbill, is a fern native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of lanceolate, dark green leaves with a distinctive reddish-brown margin. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Asplenium rubinum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-growing mats.</p>
