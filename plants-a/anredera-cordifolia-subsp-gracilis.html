<p>Anredera cordifolia subsp.</p>
<p>gracilis, commonly known as the slender heartleaf arum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by red berries, which are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it both a useful ground cover and an invasive species in some regions.</p>
