                <h1>Achnatherum lemmonii</h1>
<p>Achnatherum lemmonii, commonly known as Lemmon's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and meadows. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in arid conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in its native range.</p>
<p>Achnatherum lemmonii is often found in open grasslands and is adapted to low-nutrient environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum lemmonii has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically flat, linear, and slightly curled at the edges, arranged in a basal rosette with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, light green to grayish surface, growing in dense tufts or clumps. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that bear small, two-lobed flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, three-angled achene that is dispersed by wind, and the plant has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum lemmonii is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in states such as Nevada, Utah, and parts of California.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and grasslands. This plant is commonly associated with disturbed soils and can be found along roadsides, open slopes, and other dry habitats. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of the Great Basin and Mojave Desert regions.</p>
<p>Achnatherum lemmonii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum lemmonii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in states such as Nevada, Utah, and Arizona.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats like sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. This plant is often associated with disturbed soils and can thrive in areas with low precipitation. It is typically found at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has become an important component of local plant communities in these regions.</p>
