<p>Allagopappus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species that are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. These plants are characterized by their hairy stems, yellow flowers, and a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism involving a pappus, which aids in wind pollination. Allagopappus species are typically low-growing shrubs or herbaceous plants adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>They play an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
