                <h1>Acmadenia rosmarinifolia</h1>
<p>Acmadenia rosmarinifolia, commonly known as silverleaf acacia, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant features narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its salt tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmadenia rosmarinifolia has leaves that are oval to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size, typically around 2-4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale greyish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in dense inflorescences, displaying a pale blue to purple color, blooming during late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the well-drained soils in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia rosmarinifolia is primarily native to eastern Australia, specifically Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the subtropical rainforests and coastal heathlands of these regions. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky outcrops and woodland areas. It is an evergreen shrub that typically grows in the understory of dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the northeastern part of Australia, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia rosmarinifolia was mainly introduced to New South Wales, Australia, as part of ecological restoration and revegetation projects.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal heathlands and sandstone-derived soils, where it thrives in well-drained conditions. The plant is valued for its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for native wildlife. However, it has also been reported in other regions, including parts of Queensland and the ACT, due to its adaptability.</p>
<p>Its distribution highlights its potential as a useful plant in environmental rehabilitation efforts.</p>
