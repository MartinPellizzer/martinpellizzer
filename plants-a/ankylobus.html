                    <h1>Ankylobus</h1>
<p>Ankylobus, commonly known as the spike moss, is a genus of vascular plants belonging to the family Selaginellaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, leaf-like structures arranged in a spiral pattern along their stems. Ankylobus species typically grow in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. They possess a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains the plant's spores.</p>
<p>Ankylobus is considered a primitive vascular plant, providing important insights into the evolution of early land plants.</p>
