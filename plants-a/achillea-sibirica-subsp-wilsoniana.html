                <h1>Achillea sibirica subsp. wilsoniana</h1>
<p>Achillea sibirica subsp.</p>
<p>wilsoniana, commonly known as Siberian yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces flat, composite flower heads in shades of white to pale yellow.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm and thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils. It is drought-tolerant and prefers full sun, making it a hardy addition to alpine gardens.</p>
<p>Its aromatic foliage and showy flowers make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea sibirica subsp.</p>
<p>wilsoniana has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, hairy, and arranged in a rosette, typically measuring 5–15 cm in length and 1–3 cm in width, with a gray-green color due to dense pubescence. The stems are upright, somewhat woody at the base, with a rough, grayish-brown bark, and they grow in a compact, bushy pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are clustered in flat-topped umbels, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal, and the seeds are released in early autumn.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, enabling the plant to spread vegetatively and establish dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sibirica subsp.</p>
<p>wilsoniana is a perennial flowering plant native to Central Asia, specifically found in regions of Kazakhstan and western China. Its current distribution includes parts of Russia, Mongolia, and northern China, where it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level. The species is considered to be of low conservation concern due to its wide distribution and ability to adapt to various environmental conditions.</p>
<p>However, habitat degradation and overgrazing may threaten its long-term survival in certain areas.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea sibirica subsp.</p>
<p>wilsoniana is a hardy perennial known for its attractive, flat-topped flower heads and silver-green foliage. It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in the spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its vigor. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or yarrow can enhance its appearance and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea sibirica subsp.</p>
<p>wilsoniana is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It also attracts other wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which feed on its seeds and use its foliage for shelter.</p>
<p>This plant acts as an erosion control species due to its extensive root system, which helps stabilize soil in disturbed or marginal areas. Additionally, it can function as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its allelopathic properties.</p>
<p>Its ecological benefits extend to supporting biodiversity and improving soil health in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea sibirica subsp.</p>
<p>wilsoniana is a flowering plant native to Central Asia, known for its ornamental value in gardens and its role in traditional medicine. It has been used in herbal remedies to treat digestive issues and skin conditions due to its anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>While not widely used in culinary applications, it may have potential in the development of natural preservatives or flavorings. Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and endurance, often featured in local folklore and traditional practices.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
