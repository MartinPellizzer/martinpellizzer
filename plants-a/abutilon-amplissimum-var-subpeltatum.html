<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to several meters in height, characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and showy, lantern-shaped flowers. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with a velvety texture, and the flowers are often yellow or orange in color. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon amplissimum var. subpeltatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is generally light brown to gray in color, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. Its flowers are pendulous, with a bell-shaped structure, featuring yellow stamens and a greenish calyx, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon amplissimum var. subpeltatum is a rare shrub native to the island of Hispaniola, specifically found in the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the northern and central regions of the country. It thrives in humid, tropical environments, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils within shaded or semi-shaded forest understories. This species is found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is listed as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique plant.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon amplissimum var. subpeltatum is a fast-growing, semi-evergreen shrub known for its showy, lantern-shaped flowers and fuzzy, heart-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil, with regular watering during the growing season. Fertilize it with a balanced fertilizer in spring and prune after flowering to maintain its shape and encourage new growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it benefits from companion planting with marigolds or lavender to deter pests.</p>
