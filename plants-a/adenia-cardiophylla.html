                <h1>Adenia cardiophylla</h1>
<p>Adenia cardiophylla, commonly known as the heart-leaved adenia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a smooth texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Adenia cardiophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia cardiophylla has thick, fleshy leaves that are heart-shaped (cardiophylla refers to this), arranged alternately along the stem, with a deep green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, dark brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are large, showy, and consist of five petals, typically pink or red in color, blooming during the wet season and pollinated by birds. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or arid soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia cardiophylla is primarily native to Assam, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China South-Central, East Himalaya, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions across these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Adenia cardiophylla is commonly associated with humid climates and is often found in lowland to mid-elevation habitats.</p>
<p>Its native range spans a diverse array of ecosystems within Southeast Asia and parts of South Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia cardiophylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the North Island, particularly in the lower North Island and parts of the South Island. This plant thrives in coastal and lowland areas with sandy or gravelly soils. It is often seen in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to spread rapidly and impact native vegetation.</p>
