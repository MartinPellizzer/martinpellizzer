                <h1>Achillea kuprijanovii</h1>
<p>Achillea kuprijanovii, commonly known as Kuprianov's yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Achillea genus, with unique adaptations to its harsh, high-altitude habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea kuprijanovii has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown color, growing in a compact, bushy pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk florets surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea kuprijanovii is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, specifically in the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria in Russia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations within this region, primarily in alpine and subalpine environments. It thrives in rocky soils and open slopes, often found in areas with high solar exposure. The plant typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss and climate change, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea kuprijanovii is a low-growing perennial plant known for its daisy-like flowers and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rootstock in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The plant has a summer growth cycle, blooming from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
