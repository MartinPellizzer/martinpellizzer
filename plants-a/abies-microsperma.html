The foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in spirals along the branches. Its cones are small and typically shed their seeds when mature, contributing to its role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil.</p>
