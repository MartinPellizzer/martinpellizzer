                <h1>Actinostemon estrellensis</h1>
<p>Actinostemon estrellensis, commonly known as the Estrellan starflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and features small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinostemon estrellensis has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a deep green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon estrellensis is primarily native to the high-altitude regions of the Sierra Madre Occidental in the state of Nayarit, Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in rocky and well-drained soils within cloud forests and pine-oak woodlands. This species is endemic to a very limited geographic area, making it a rare and localized plant. It thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon estrellensis was mainly introduced to the region of Estrella, Ecuador, as a result of its unique ecological niche and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It has been documented in several local habitats, including disturbed soils and rocky outcrops. The plant's distribution is limited, with only a few known populations within its native range. It is considered a rare species, with its introduction likely due to both natural dispersal and human activity.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect its habitat and prevent further decline.</p>
