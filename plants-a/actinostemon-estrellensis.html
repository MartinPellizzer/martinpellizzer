<p>Actinostemon estrellensis, commonly known as the Estrellan starflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and features small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
