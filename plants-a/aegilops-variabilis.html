                    <h1>Aegilops variabilis</h1>
<p>Aegilops variabilis, commonly known as the variable wild emmer, is a wild relative of wheat native to the Fertile Crescent.</p>
<p>It is a diploid grass species with a genome size that is smaller than that of common wheat. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed habitats and has a distinctive spikelet structure. It is characterized by its variable morphology, which has led to its name and has made it a subject of taxonomic debate.</p>
<p>Aegilops variabilis plays a role in wheat evolution and is studied for its genetic diversity and potential in breeding programs.</p>
