                <h1>Aegilops variabilis</h1>
<p>Aegilops variabilis, commonly known as the variable wild emmer, is a wild relative of wheat native to the Fertile Crescent.</p>
<p>It is a diploid grass species with a genome size that is smaller than that of common wheat. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed habitats and has a distinctive spikelet structure. It is characterized by its variable morphology, which has led to its name and has made it a subject of taxonomic debate.</p>
<p>Aegilops variabilis plays a role in wheat evolution and is studied for its genetic diversity and potential in breeding programs.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops variabilis has leaves that are narrow, blade-like, and alternate in arrangement, typically ranging from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and grows upright, with a greenish hue that becomes more reddish near the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a cylindrical spikelet containing small, dry seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in disturbed soils and arid environments.</p>
