<p>Atriplex canescens subsp.</p>
<p>typica, commonly known as silverleaf chenopod, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, powdery hairs that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in compact clusters, and its leaves are typically alternate and lance-shaped. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to low moisture conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these regions.</p>
