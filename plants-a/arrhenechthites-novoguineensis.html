<p>Arrhenechthites novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in the humid, tropical environments of New Guinea and adjacent islands.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
