                <h1>Acrotriche parviflora</h1>
<p>Acrotriche parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered acrotriche, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Campanulaceae family, known for its bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, white or pale blue flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it has a compact, shrub-like growth habit.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotriche parviflora has small, ovate, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when dry.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotriche parviflora is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal regions and sandplains of the state. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with dune environments. It is an important component of the local flora in these areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Western Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotriche parviflora was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, ditches, and open woodlands. This plant thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often associated with xeric environments. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and urban landscapes.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native plant communities.</p>
