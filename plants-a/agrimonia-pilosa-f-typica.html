<p>Agrimonia pilosa f. typica, commonly known as the common agrimony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called achenes, which are typically covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are pinnately divided with serrated edges, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Agrimony has a long history of use in herbal medicine for its purported digestive and astringent properties.</p>
