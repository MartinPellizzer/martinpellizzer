                    <h1>Acrolasia tweedyi</h1>
<p>Acrolasia tweedyi, commonly known as the Tweedy's acrolasia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its leaves are elliptical with a leathery texture, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Acrolasia tweedyi is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and conservation.</p>
