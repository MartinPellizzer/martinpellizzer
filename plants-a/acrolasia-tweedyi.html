                <h1>Acrolasia tweedyi</h1>
<p>Acrolasia tweedyi, commonly known as the Tweedy's acrolasia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its leaves are elliptical with a leathery texture, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Acrolasia tweedyi is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and conservation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrolasia tweedyi has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and exhibits a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green, consisting of five petals and stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule containing numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia tweedyi is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and the coastal regions of the Carolinas.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils found in coastal dunes and maritime hammocks. This plant is commonly found in areas with high salinity and frequent salt spray, which are characteristic of its natural habitat. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia tweedyi was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. Despite its aesthetic value, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species for resources. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along waterways.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
