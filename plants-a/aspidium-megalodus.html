<p>Aspidium megalodus, commonly known as the giant wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant has a robust rhizome system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Aspidium megalodus is native to various regions in Asia and is often found in forest understories where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade.</p>
