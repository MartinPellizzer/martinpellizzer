                <h1>Acnida alabamensis</h1>
<p>Acnida alabamensis, commonly known as the Alabama acnida, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnida alabamensis has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture and a size ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and grows upright with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more fibrous with age. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white in color, with five petals and a tubular structure, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, aiding in the plant's ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnida alabamensis is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Alabama and parts of Florida.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, hardwood forest understories and along stream banks. This plant thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often associated with cypress and tupelo habitats. It is a rare species, with limited distribution and is considered endangered in some areas.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, conservation efforts are essential to protect its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnida alabamensis was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Alabama and neighboring states.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and along fence rows. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun conditions. It is known for its small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common sight in both natural and human-altered landscapes.</p>
