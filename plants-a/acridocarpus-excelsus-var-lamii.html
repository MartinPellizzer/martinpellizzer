                <h1>Acridocarpus excelsus var. lamii</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus excelsus var. lamii, commonly known as the Java fig or *Ficus lamii*, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig-like fruits. It is native to Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and fruit production, it is cultivated in tropical regions for both ornamental and agricultural purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus excelsus var. lamii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus excelsus var. lamii is a rare and endangered plant species native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>While its original range was limited to specific regions in eastern Madagascar, its current distribution is restricted to a few isolated locations due to habitat loss. It thrives in humid, tropical rainforest environments, typically growing in shaded understorey conditions. This variety is found at altitudes between 500 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited population and threats from deforestation, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus excelsus var. lamii is a hardy, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions, known for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings offering faster and more reliable results. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, reaching maturity within a few years under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between sessions. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and encourage bushiness. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus excelsus var. lamii is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. This plant acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing the growth of neighboring crops. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus excelsus var. lamii is a tropical plant known for its potential uses across various domains.</p>
<p>In culinary applications, its leaves are sometimes used as a vegetable in traditional dishes, adding a unique flavor. Medicinally, it has been explored for its possible anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Industrially, its fibers may have applications in textile production, contributing to local economies.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions, often representing resilience and adaptability.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus excelsus var. lamii has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Variegata' and 'Compacta', which display unique leaf patterns and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>While the species is not widely hybridized, some horticulturalists have experimented with crosses to enhance foliage color and disease resistance. These cultivars are particularly valued in tropical and subtropical gardens for their striking appearance and adaptability. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in shaded conditions and its use as a decorative shrub.</p>
<p>Its limited hybridization highlights the need for conservation of its genetic diversity.</p>
