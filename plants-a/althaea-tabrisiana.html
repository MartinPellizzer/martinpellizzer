                    <h1>Althaea tabrisiana</h1>
<p>Althaea tabrisiana, commonly known as the Armenian marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is thick and fleshy, which helps it store water in its native arid or semi-arid habitats.</p>
<p>Althaea tabrisiana is valued for its mucilage-rich roots, which have been used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties.</p>
