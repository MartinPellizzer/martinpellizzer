<p>Aquilicia ottilis, commonly known as the silverleaf shrub, is a perennial plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, spherical fruits. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater during droughts.</p>
<p>Aquilicia ottilis is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber due to its hardy nature and adaptability.</p>
