                <h1>Acuan guadeloupense</h1>
<p>Acuan guadeloupense, commonly known as the Guadeloupe acacia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Acuan guadeloupense is adapted to grow in coastal areas and is often found in sandy or limestone soils.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acuan guadeloupense has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acuan guadeloupense is primarily native to the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats within these regions. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen along the shoreline. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the Lesser Antilles.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acuan guadeloupense was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in coastal regions and lowland areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and the Gulf Coast states. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage. It has been reported to spread aggressively in some regions, sometimes outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
