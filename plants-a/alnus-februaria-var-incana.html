<p>Alnus februaria var. incana, commonly known as the gray alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish-white bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>This species is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with bacteria in its root system.</p>
