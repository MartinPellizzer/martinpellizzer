                <h1>Achnatherum tenuifolium</h1>
<p>Achnatherum tenuifolium, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, narrow leaves and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, awned spikelets. It is adapted to harsh environments, including alpine and arctic regions, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Achnatherum tenuifolium plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum tenuifolium has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 10 to 30 centimeters in length, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a light green to brownish color, growing upright and branching towards the top. The flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, greenish to brownish florets, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-angled achene, and seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and hairy structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum tenuifolium is primarily native to the grasslands and steppes of central Asia, including regions such as Mongolia, Tibet, and parts of Russia.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in open plains and mountainous areas. This species is also present in western China, particularly in the Xinjiang region. It is well adapted to cold and dry conditions, making it a common component of high-altitude vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the ecological conditions of these regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum tenuifolium was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in areas with dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It has been widely planted for erosion control and as a forage crop due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is often found in regions with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several states, including California, Nevada, and Utah.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in these areas and has not been widely naturalized in the wild.</p>
