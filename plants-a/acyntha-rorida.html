                <h1>Acyntha rorida</h1>
<p>Acyntha rorida, commonly known as the sweet flower or sweet violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Acyntha rorida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Its flowers emit a subtle fragrance, making it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acyntha rorida has leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and covered in fine hairs, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in inflorescences, displaying shades of pink and white, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acyntha rorida is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. This plant is also present in the Canary Islands and Madeira, where it adapts to the local climate and terrain. It is often associated with dry, sunny habitats and is considered a characteristic species of the Mediterranean flora.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, its distribution is relatively limited to these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acyntha rorida was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and abandoned agricultural lands.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in temperate climates and has been reported in several countries across Europe and parts of North America. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities and ecosystem balance.</p>
