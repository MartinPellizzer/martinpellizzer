                <h1>Agropyron melantherum</h1>
<p>Agropyron melantherum, commonly known as the blackgrass or slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, slender leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and cooler climates, often found in mountainous and alpine environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Agropyron melantherum is also valued for its forage quality and has been used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
