                    <h1>Alnaster × hosoii</h1>
<p>Alnaster × hosoii, commonly known as the Japanese alder, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Alnus hirsuta and Alnus firma.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5–10 meters, characterized by its slender trunk and spreading crown. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate with serrated edges, turning yellow in the autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is native to Japan and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
