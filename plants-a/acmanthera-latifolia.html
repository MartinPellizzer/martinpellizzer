                <h1>Acmanthera latifolia</h1>
<p>Acmanthera latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf acmanthera, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmanthera latifolia has broad, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmanthera latifolia is primarily native to Brazil North.</p>
<p>It is found in the northern regions of Brazil, including the Amazon Basin and surrounding areas. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical environments with high humidity and abundant rainfall. It is commonly found in moist forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely linked to the rich biodiversity of the Amazon region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmanthera latifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native forests and displacing indigenous species. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is particularly problematic in the North Island.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to increased management efforts to control its spread and protect native ecosystems.</p>
