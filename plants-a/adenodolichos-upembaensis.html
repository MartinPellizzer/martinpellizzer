                <h1>Adenodolichos upembaensis</h1>
<p>Adenodolichos upembaensis, commonly known as the Upemba milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is adapted to tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in moist, shaded areas. Its root system has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role and potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos upembaensis has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that are usually green and have a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in axillary spikes, with white to pale yellow petals and a distinct yellow stamen, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release small, bean-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos upembaensis is primarily native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical rainforest regions of DR Congo. It thrives in humid and warm climates with high rainfall. Adenodolichos upembaensis is typically found in lowland areas near rivers and swampy regions.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific habitats within DR Congo.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos upembaensis was mainly introduced to the southern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, specifically around the Upemba Depression.</p>
<p>It is typically found in swampy and seasonally flooded areas, often near water bodies such as lakes and rivers. This plant has adapted well to the wetland environments, thriving in the moist and nutrient-rich soils. Its introduction has been noted in ecological studies focusing on the region's flora and vegetation patterns.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains relatively localized and not widely spread beyond its native habitat.</p>
