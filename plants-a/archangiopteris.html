                    <h1>Archangiopteris</h1>
<p>Archangiopteris, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a fossil plant from the late Paleozoic era.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Marattiaceae and is characterized by its large, complex fronds. The plant had a well-developed vascular system, allowing it to grow tall and support its massive leaves. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, were located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Archangiopteris played a significant role in the ancient ecosystems, contributing to the formation of coal deposits.</p>
