<p>Aegilops triaristata subsp.</p>
<p>quadriaristata, commonly known as the four-awned goatgrass, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive inflorescence with four awns on each lemma, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
