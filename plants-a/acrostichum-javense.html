<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic oils. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland forests or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it both ornamental and economically valuable in various regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum javense has large, pinnately compound leaves that are elongated and green, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 1-2 meters long, with lance-shaped leaflets that are glossy and dark green in color. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by wind.</p>
