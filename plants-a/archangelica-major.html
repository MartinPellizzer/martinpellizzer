                    <h1>Archangelica major</h1>
<p>Archangelica major, commonly known as hogweed, is a tall biennial or perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white or greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by dark, spherical berries. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap and phototoxic effects, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
