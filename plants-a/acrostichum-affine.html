                <h1>Acrostichum affine</h1>
<p>Acrostichum affine, commonly known as the common brake, is a species of fern native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its fronds are dimorphic, with sterile and fertile leaves differing in structure.</p>
<p>Acrostichum affine plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum affine has large, feather-like leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and can reach up to 2 meters in length, with a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is robust, with a rough, fibrous bark that is typically brown in color, and it grows in a creeping or upright manner depending on the environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, with greenish-white petals, blooming in the late summer to early fall, and they are primarily pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, three-winged samara that disperses its seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum affine is primarily native to the tropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland areas, often near rivers and in coastal regions. This plant thrives in swampy or wetland habitats, where it can form dense stands. It is also occasionally found in the Caribbean and parts of Florida in the United States.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to warm, moist environments with high humidity and abundant rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum affine was mainly introduced to coastal and wetland areas where it can thrive in moist, saline environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mangrove swamps and tidal flats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. This plant is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate extreme conditions. Its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native species in certain regions.</p>
<p>Overall, Acrostichum affine is an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
