                    <h1>Acacia nilotica</h1>
<p>Acacia nilotica, commonly known as the Sudanese acacia or the devil's tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, flat, greenish-gray phyllodes that are often mistaken for leaves. The plant produces yellow flower spikes during the dry season, which are followed by woody pods containing flat, oval seeds. Acacia nilotica is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in savannas and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its bark and wood have been traditionally used for various purposes, including tanning leather and making tools.</p>
