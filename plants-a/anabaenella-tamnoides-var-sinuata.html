                    <h1>Anabaenella tamnoides var. sinuata</h1>
<p>Anabaenella tamnoides var. sinuata, commonly known as the sinuous blue-green alga, is a colonial cyanobacterium characterized by its filamentous structure composed of unbranched, cylindrical cells.</p>
<p>It forms dense, gelatinous mats that often thrive in freshwater environments, particularly in nutrient-rich, shallow waters. The species is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems. Its morphology includes distinct, sinuous filaments that can be easily identified under a microscope.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other Anabaenella species but is distinguished by its unique cellular arrangement and growth patterns.</p>
