                <h1>Acrolasia latifolia</h1>
<p>Acrolasia latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved acrolasia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrolasia latifolia has broad, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and reddish-brown in color, with a growth pattern that is typically erect and branching. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia latifolia is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in primary and secondary rainforests, often near rivers and streams. It plays an important ecological role in these ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia latifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in different climates have contributed to its spread beyond its original introduction sites. However, it is not considered invasive in New Zealand and is primarily managed as a non-native species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the northern and eastern parts of the country.</p>
