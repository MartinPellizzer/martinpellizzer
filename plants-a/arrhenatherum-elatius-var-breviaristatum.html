                    <h1>Arrhenatherum elatius var. breviaristatum</h1>
<p>Arrhenatherum elatius var. breviaristatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood sedge, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters, often arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its shorter, more compact inflorescences compared to the typical form of Arrhenatherum elatius.</p>
