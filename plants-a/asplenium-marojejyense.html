                    <h1>Asplenium marojejyense</h1>
<p>Asplenium marojejyense, commonly known as the Marojejy spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid forest areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
