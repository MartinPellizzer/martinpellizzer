                <h1>Aechmea kautskyana</h1>
<p>Aechmea kautskyana, commonly known as the Kautsky's pineapple plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with vibrant red bracts and small white flowers, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Aechmea kautskyana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to adapt to indoor conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea kautskyana has rosette-shaped leaves that are sword-like, stiff, and covered with a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving them a silvery appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged in a tight rosette at the base, and they can grow up to 30 cm in length, with a bluish-green color. The plant has a short, thick, and underground stem, with a fibrous root system that helps anchor it in the soil. It produces terminal inflorescences with colorful, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds through wind and water.</p>
