<p>Astragalus limnocharis var. tabulaeus, commonly known as the water milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a hairy surface that aids in moisture retention.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
