<p>Androsace carnea subsp.</p>
<p>adfinis, commonly known as the pink rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white to grayish pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a subtle ornamental value to its rocky habitat. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth and attractive flowers, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine gardens.</p>
