                    <h1>Aloe prostrata</h1>
<p>Aloe prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with fleshy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Aloe prostrata is often used in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
