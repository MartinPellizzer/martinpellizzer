                <h1>Acer kwangsiense</h1>
<p>Acer kwangsiense, commonly known as the Guangxi maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red samaras in the fall. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape tree.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer kwangsiense has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a pointed tip and serrated edges, typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, turning red or orange in the fall. The stem is straight and upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in clusters during late spring, relying on wind for pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer kwangsiense is a rare species of maple native to the Guangxi region of southern China.</p>
<p>It is currently found primarily in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, with some records from neighboring areas in Yunnan and Guangdong. This plant thrives in humid, subtropical environments, typically growing in dense forests with rich soil. It is usually found at altitudes between 800 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acer kwangsiense is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer kwangsiense is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for germination. The growth cycle of Acer kwangsiense includes a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with plants like ferns or rhododendrons can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer kwangsiense is a valuable plant species that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, which are essential for its reproduction and the health of the ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land and protecting against degradation.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer kwangsiense plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer kwangsiense is a species of maple native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
