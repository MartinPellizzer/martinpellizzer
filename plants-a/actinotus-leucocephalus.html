                <h1>Actinotus leucocephalus</h1>
<p>Actinotus leucocephalus, commonly known as the whitehead bellflower, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking white, bell-shaped flowers with a yellow center. The plant features delicate, hairy leaves and grows in a low, spreading habit. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Actinotus leucocephalus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinotus leucocephalus has narrow, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green upper surface and a slightly paler underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, resembling a crown, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinotus leucocephalus is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the south-western region of the state, particularly in the areas of the Fitzgerald River National Park and the south-western agricultural region. This plant typically grows in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and heathland environments. It is known for its distinctive white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinotus leucocephalus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant thrives in coastal and subalpine environments. It has since become naturalized in several regions of the country.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and is often cultivated for its attractive white flowers.</p>
