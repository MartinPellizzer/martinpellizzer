                <h1>Adhatoda engleriana</h1>
<p>Adhatoda engleriana, commonly known as the Indian devil's ivy, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid climates.</p>
<p>Adhatoda engleriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda engleriana has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are typically 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and branching, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rough and fissured with age. The flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, featuring tubular corollas with five lobes, and are typically pink to purple in color, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda engleriana is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Thailand, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of Africa and the Caribbean, likely due to human introduction. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in moist, well-drained soils near rivers or in shaded forest understories. It typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its distribution has been impacted by habitat loss and overharvesting for medicinal use.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda engleriana is a tropical plant known for its ornamental leaves and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for rapid growth. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, thriving in warm climates and reaching maturity within a few months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions to prevent root rot. Regular fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer and pruning to maintain shape and encourage new growth are essential for its health. It is relatively resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
