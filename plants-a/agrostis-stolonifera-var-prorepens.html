                    <h1>Agrostis stolonifera var. prorepens</h1>
<p>Agrostis stolonifera var. prorepens, commonly known as mat grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growth through stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
