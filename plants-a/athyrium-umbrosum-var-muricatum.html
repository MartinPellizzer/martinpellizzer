                    <h1>Athyrium umbrosum var. muricatum</h1>
<p>Athyrium umbrosum var. muricatum, commonly known as the dark-leaf fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, glossy, leathery fronds that often exhibit a deep green to almost black coloration. The plant produces upright, spore-bearing fiddleheads in early spring, which are distinctive for their curled, spiral shape. Its foliage is dense and can form a thick carpet, making it suitable for shaded garden environments.</p>
<p>The varietal name "muricatum" refers to the rough, textured surface of its leaves, which are covered in small, raised bumps.</p>
