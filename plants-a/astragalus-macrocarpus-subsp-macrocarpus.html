<p>Astragalus macrocarpus subsp.</p>
<p>macrocarpus, commonly known as the large-seeded milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves with 10 to 20 pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces showy, yellow to orange flowers in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments with deep taproots for water absorption. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, contributing to ecological diversity in its native range.</p>
