                <h1>Achoriphragma botschantzevii</h1>
<p>Achoriphragma botschantzevii, commonly known as the Botswana thornveld grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear sharp spines. The plant typically thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Achoriphragma botschantzevii plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma botschantzevii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern with branching at the base. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma botschantzevii is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of Russia, particularly in the areas of the Caucasus and the Central Asian steppes.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This plant is also found in parts of northern Kazakhstan and southern Ukraine. It is commonly associated with disturbed soils and can often be seen growing along roadsides and in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited, making it a rare and localized species in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma botschantzevii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native habitats. The plant competes with native species for resources, threatening local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Efforts are underway to control its spread and prevent further ecological damage.</p>
