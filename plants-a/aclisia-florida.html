                <h1>Aclisia florida</h1>
<p>Aclisia florida, commonly known as the Florida starfruit, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces bright orange, fleshy fruits that are edible and contain a single seed. Aclisia florida thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a suitable plant for warm climates.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and unique fruit make it a notable species in botanical gardens and native plant collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aclisia florida has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a glossy green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough and fissured with age, and it grows upright with some branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, featuring white petals with a yellow center, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to absorb moisture from the soil efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aclisia florida is primarily native to the southern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Texas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. This plant thrives in well-drained, sunny environments and is often seen in dune ecosystems. It is also known to grow in disturbed soils and along roadsides in its native range.</p>
<p>Aclisia florida is an important species for local wildlife, providing food and habitat for various insects and birds.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aclisia florida was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive, showy flowers. The plant has since spread into nearby wetlands and disturbed areas, becoming a common sight in these habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist environments have led to its classification as an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to control its spread and protect native plant communities.</p>
