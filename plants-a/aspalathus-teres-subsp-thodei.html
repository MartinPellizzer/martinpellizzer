<p>Aspalathus teres subsp.</p>
<p>thodei, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant is closely related to the more well-known rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) but differs in leaf shape and size. It is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>This subspecies is less commonly cultivated than its relative but holds potential for future horticultural and commercial use.</p>
