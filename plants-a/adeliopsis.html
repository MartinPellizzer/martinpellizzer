                    <h1>Adeliopsis</h1>
<p>Adeliopsis, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a flowering plant native to the extreme environments of Antarctica and the southern tip of South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, low-growing perennial that thrives in harsh, cold climates with minimal soil. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that are often hidden among its dense, hairy foliage. Adeliopsis has adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme seasonal variations.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and resilience make it an important subject in studies of plant adaptation to extreme environments.</p>
