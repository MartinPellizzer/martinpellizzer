                <h1>Adipera mexicana</h1>
<p>Adipera mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican fat tree, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by colorful bracts. Its roots are known to contain compounds used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Adipera mexicana is also valued for its ornamental appeal due to its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adipera mexicana has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and greenish in color, with a creeping or ascending growth pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green with four petals, blooming in spring and summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adipera mexicana is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, prairies, and sandy soils. This plant thrives in areas with full sun and well-drained soil conditions. It is also occasionally found in parts of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>Adipera mexicana is a member of the Asteraceae family and is known for its yellow flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adipera mexicana was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue-green foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscapes in states such as Texas, Florida, and California. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has the potential to become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it adaptable to a variety of climates.</p>
<p>However, its spread can pose a challenge to native plant communities if left unchecked.</p>
