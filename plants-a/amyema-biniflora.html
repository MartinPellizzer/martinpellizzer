<p>Amyema biniflora, commonly known as the two-branched mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees in Australia.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain sticky seeds that adhere to the bark of host trees.</p>
<p>Amyema biniflora plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for birds and insects, while also affecting the growth of its host trees.</p>
