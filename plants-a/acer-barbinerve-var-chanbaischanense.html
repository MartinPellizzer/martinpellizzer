                <h1>Acer barbinerve var. chanbaischanense</h1>
<p>Acer barbinerve var. chanbaischanense, commonly known as the Sichuan maple, is a variant of the barbinerve maple native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves with 5–7 lobes, which are often finely serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant fall foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer barbinerve var. chanbaischanense has elliptical to ovate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, reaching up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth habit. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming in late spring; they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two wings, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer barbinerve var. chanbaischanense is a rare variant of the barbinerve maple, native to the mountainous regions of western China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to isolated populations in these areas, where it thrives in humid, temperate climates. It typically grows in forested understories at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is classified as endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve this unique species in its natural environment.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer barbinerve var. chanbaischanense is a rare and ornamental maple species that thrives in temperate climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering a more reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. The growth cycle of this plant involves a period of active growth in spring, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining, slightly acidic soil and requires consistent watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while pruning should be done in late winter to shape the tree and remove any diseased branches. This species is generally resistant to pests and diseases, though it may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot fungi, which can be managed with appropriate organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like lavender or marigold can help deter pests and enhance the garden's biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer barbinerve var. chanbaischanense is a unique plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, aiding in the reproduction of both the plant and other flora in the ecosystem. It acts as a companion plant in forest understories, enhancing soil health and promoting the growth of other native species. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>This plant also plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil and supporting the growth of nearby vegetation.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer barbinerve var. chanbaischanense is a lesser-known maple species with limited documented uses and applications.</p>
<p>While it is not widely utilized in culinary contexts, its leaves and bark may have local traditional uses in some regions. In medicinal applications, it has been studied for potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, though research remains limited. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and may support local ecosystems, offering economic value through ecotourism or sustainable harvesting.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in its native regions, often representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer barbinerve var. chanbaischanense has several notable cultivars, including 'Crimson King' and 'Red Sunset', which are prized for their vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>It also serves as a parent in various hybrids, such as Acer × carpinifolium, which combines its ornamental traits with those of other maple species. These hybrids are often valued for their adaptability and visual appeal in园林 design. The variety's unique leaf structure and seasonal color changes contribute to its horticultural importance.</p>
<p>Overall, it remains a sought-after species for gardeners and landscape designers seeking distinctive maple specimens.</p>
