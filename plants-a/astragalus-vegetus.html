                    <h1>Astragalus vegetus</h1>
<p>Astragalus vegetus, commonly known as the common milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus vegetus is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
