                    <h1>Acanthophyllum paniculatum</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum paniculatum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in panicles, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays a vital role in stabilizing desert ecosystems and preventing soil erosion.</p>
