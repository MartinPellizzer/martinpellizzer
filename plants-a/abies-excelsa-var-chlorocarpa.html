                        <h1>Abies excelsa var. chlorocarpa</h1>
<p>Abies excelsa var. chlorocarpa, commonly known as the green-barked fir, is a rare and distinctive variant of the white fir.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique dark green bark, which contrasts with the typical silver-gray bark of the standard species. The tree has conical, dense foliage with needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological traits.</p>
