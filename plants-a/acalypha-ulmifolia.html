<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha ulmifolia was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in gardens and as a ground cover because of its rapid growth and ability to thrive in both sunny and partially shaded areas.
