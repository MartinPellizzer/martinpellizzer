                    <h1>Arundo tenella</h1>
<p>Arundo tenella, commonly known as dwarf reed, is a compact, ornamental grass native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green, with a slight blue-gray hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its upright growth habit and low maintenance, it is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a decorative element.</p>
