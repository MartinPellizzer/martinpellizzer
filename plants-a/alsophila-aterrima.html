                    <h1>Alsophila aterrima</h1>
<p>Alsophila aterrima, commonly known as the dark fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate rainforests. Its rhizome system supports the growth of new shoots, contributing to its slow but steady expansion.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically dark green, with a leathery texture that helps retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
