<p>Asplenium avicula, commonly known as the mouse's tail or scaly spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white or silver scales. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rock crevices or on tree trunks, and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Asplenium avicula is often used in horticulture as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
