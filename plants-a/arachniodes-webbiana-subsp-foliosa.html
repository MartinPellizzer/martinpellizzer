<p>Arachniodes webbiana subsp.</p>
<p>foliosa, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows on rocky substrates in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are often divided into segments with a distinctive, almost spider-like appearance.</p>
<p>The spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
