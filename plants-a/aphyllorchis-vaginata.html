                    <h1>Aphyllorchis vaginata</h1>
<p>Aphyllorchis vaginata, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, hood-like structure formed by the fused sepals and petals, which enclose the reproductive organs. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and has small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the spring. Aphyllorchis vaginata is known for its specialized symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
