<p>semenovii, commonly known as the Siberian fir, is a subspecies native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are dark green and often slightly twisted.</p>
<p>The cones are typically pendulous, with scales that open to release seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of boreal and subalpine ecosystems.</p>
