<p>Alnus acutissima, commonly known as the sharpleaf alder, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 2â€“5 inches long. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are wind-pollinated. It often grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in riparian zones.</p>
<p>Alnus acutissima plays an important ecological role by improving soil nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
