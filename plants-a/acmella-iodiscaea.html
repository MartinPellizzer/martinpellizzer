                <h1>Acmella iodiscaea</h1>
<p>Acmella iodiscaea, commonly known as the golden crown flower, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its vibrant yellow-orange flowers that resemble a crown. The plant typically grows in wetland environments and thrives in moist, sunny conditions. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Acmella iodiscaea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella iodiscaea has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. The flowers are bright yellow, consisting of a single petal-like structure with a central spadix, blooming in the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella iodiscaea is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America, specifically found in countries like Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to specific high-altitude areas in the Andes. It thrives in humid, temperate environments with well-drained soils, typically growing in forest understories or rocky slopes. This species is found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmella iodiscaea is a tropical plant known for its ornamental value and unique flower structure.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, blooming within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, but it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain its shape and encourage more blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but can be affected by aphids and fungal infections if care is not taken.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
