                <h1>Acmella iodiscaea</h1>
<p>Acmella iodiscaea, commonly known as the red bugseed, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has hairy, ovate leaves and produces capsules as its fruit, which contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella iodiscaea has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, and a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and slightly woody, with a pale greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are small, yellowish with a distinctive central dark spot, and are arranged in clusters; they bloom during the summer months and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella iodiscaea is primarily native to the Bahamas, Dominican Republic, Leeward Islands, and Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils within these regions. It thrives in warm, tropical climates with ample sunlight. The species is often associated with maritime environments and is sometimes found in dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the unique environmental conditions of the Caribbean region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella iodiscaea was mainly introduced to the southeastern coastal regions of Australia, where it has become naturalized in wetland and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced through human activity, possibly as an ornamental plant or for erosion control. The plant has since spread along riverbanks and in coastal dunes, forming dense mats that can outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist conditions have led to concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes used in horticulture for its bright yellow flowers.</p>
