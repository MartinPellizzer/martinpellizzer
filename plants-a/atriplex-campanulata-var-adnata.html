                    <h1>Atriplex campanulata var. adnata</h1>
<p>Atriplex campanulata var. adnata, commonly known as the narrowleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often blue-green leaves that are typically covered in a layer of fine, salt-excreting hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are adapted for wind pollination. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in saline soils, making it well-suited for harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
