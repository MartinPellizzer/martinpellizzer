                        <h1>Acalypha multiflora</h1>
<p>Acalypha multiflora, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false holly, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges.</p>
<p>Acalypha multiflora is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha multiflora is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with forest understories or along riverbanks. It is also present in parts of India and Indonesia, where it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends across various island chains in the Pacific as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha multiflora was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturalists and gardeners seeking exotic plants for landscaping purposes. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind, water, or animals.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species in island environments.</p>
