                    <h1>Atriplex straminea</h1>
<p>Atriplex straminea, commonly known as shadscale, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its succulent leaves and stems store water, enabling it to thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Atriplex straminea plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
