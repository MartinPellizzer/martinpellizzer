                <h1>Actinophyllum pentandrum</h1>
<p>Actinophyllum pentandrum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistflower, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. It typically grows in heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Actinophyllum pentandrum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinophyllum pentandrum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a dull green color on the upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that has a slightly fibrous texture, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, and clustered in racemes, blooming during the spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophyllum pentandrum is primarily native to eastern Australia, including the states of New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in subtropical and temperate regions, particularly in coastal areas and sandy soils. This species thrives in open woodlands and heathlands, often growing in well-drained soils. It is known for its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>The plant is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the specific environmental conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophyllum pentandrum was mainly introduced to the southeastern coastal regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, waste lands, and along creek lines. This plant thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often associated with coastal vegetation. Its distribution has expanded due to human activities and habitat modification.</p>
<p>It is considered a weed in some areas due to its ability to spread rapidly and compete with native vegetation.</p>
