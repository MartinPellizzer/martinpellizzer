                <h1>Achyrophorus minimus</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus minimus, commonly known as the dwarf lily of the valley, is a small herbaceous perennial plant native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, white flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 inches and prefers moist, well-drained soils in shaded environments. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies in suitable conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers emit a subtle fragrance and bloom in late spring, making it a notable species in woodland gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus minimus has small, ovate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and hairy, with a light green color and a creeping growth pattern that allows it to spread along the ground. Its flowers are simple, with five white petals and a yellow center, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus minimus is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically in the coastal plains of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is commonly found in maritime dune ecosystems. This plant is adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune systems and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus minimus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high sunlight exposure and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in regions with a temperate climate, where it can establish itself quickly in vacant spaces. Its introduction has been noted in several parts of North America, where it has spread along transportation corridors and urban landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
