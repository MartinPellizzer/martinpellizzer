                    <h1>Anthemis pusilla</h1>
<p>Anthemis pusilla, commonly known as dwarf tansy, is a small annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 10-30 centimeters and features finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers with a subtle, aromatic scent, often mistaken for chamomile due to its similar appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties have been historically used for digestive and antiseptic purposes.</p>
