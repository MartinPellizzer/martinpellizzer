                <h1>Adhatoda tetramera</h1>
<p>Adhatoda tetramera, commonly known as the four-parted adenophora, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Adhatoda tetramera is noted for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional medicine for various health purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda tetramera has leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green to brownish bark that peels off in thin layers. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with a pale blue to violet color, blooming during the rainy season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, helping the plant to anchor itself and store nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda tetramera is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Thailand, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. The plant thrives in humid climates and is often found in forested areas or near water sources. It is also present in parts of China and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other tropical regions outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda tetramera was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, tropical climates. The plant is often seen growing in disturbed soils and has adapted well to urban and rural environments. Its introduction is likely due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas, raising concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
