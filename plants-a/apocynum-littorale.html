                    <h1>Apocynum littorale</h1>
<p>Apocynum littorale, commonly known as coastal milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or muddy soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in salty or brackish environments. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are clustered in umbels, producing a striking pink or purple color. The milky sap, which is characteristic of the Apocynum genus, is toxic and can cause skin irritation.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems, particularly for certain species of butterflies and other pollinators.</p>
