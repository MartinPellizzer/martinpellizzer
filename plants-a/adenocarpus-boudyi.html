                <h1>Adenocarpus boudyi</h1>
<p>Adenocarpus boudyi, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, a common feature in the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>Adenocarpus boudyi is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus boudyi has leaves that are narrow and elongated, with a slightly serrated edge, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, greyish-brown bark that grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus boudyi is primarily native to Morocco.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country. This plant typically grows in rocky and sandy soils. It is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Morocco.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus boudyi was mainly introduced to new environments due to its adaptability and potential for erosion control.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, making it suitable for rehabilitation of degraded lands. The plant has been introduced in several countries in Africa and the Middle East as part of ecological restoration projects. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil contribute to its success in these areas.</p>
<p>However, there are concerns about its potential invasiveness in some ecosystems.</p>
