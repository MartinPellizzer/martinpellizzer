<p>Agrostis delfini, commonly known as the sea grass or coastal grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds.</p>
<p>Agrostis delfini plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
