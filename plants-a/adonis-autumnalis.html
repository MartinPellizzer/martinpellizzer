                <h1>Adonis autumnalis</h1>
<p>Adonis autumnalis, commonly known as autumnal adonis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, which includes buttercups and other showy flowers. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in late summer to early autumn, typically from August to October. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Adonis autumnalis is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis autumnalis has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy, with a narrow, pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a reddish-brown color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are yellow, with a single central stigma surrounded by several petals, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated by insects. The plant produces follicles as fruits, which release seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis autumnalis is primarily native to southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as Spain, France, Italy, and parts of the Mediterranean basin. This plant thrives in rocky soils and open habitats, often growing in mountainous areas. Its distribution includes countries like Portugal, Greece, and Turkey.</p>
<p>It is also present in some parts of southwestern Asia, including Iran and Afghanistan.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis autumnalis was mainly introduced to new habitats in North America through horticultural trade and landscaping practices.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, ditches, and open fields. The plant spreads primarily through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind, water, and animals. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its establishment in various ecological regions.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas due to its competitive nature.</p>
