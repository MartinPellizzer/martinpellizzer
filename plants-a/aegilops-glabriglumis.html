<p>It is characterized by its slender, glabrous (smooth) spikelets and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its close relation to cultivated wheat, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
