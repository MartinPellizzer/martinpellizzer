                    <h1>Avicennia marina var. acutissima</h1>
<p>Avicennia marina var. acutissima, commonly known as the slender mangrove, is a variant of the mangrove species native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant thrives in intertidal zones, where it tolerates periodic submersion and saltwater inundation. Its pneumatophores, or breathing roots, allow it to absorb oxygen from the waterlogged soil.</p>
<p>This variant plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
