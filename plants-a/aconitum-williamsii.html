                    <h1>Aconitum williamsii</h1>
<p>Aconitum williamsii, commonly known as the Tibetan monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It features striking purple to blue flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, characteristic of the genus Aconitum. The plant has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>However, all parts of the plant are highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids.</p>
