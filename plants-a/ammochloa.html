                    <h1>Ammochloa</h1>
<p>Ammochloa, commonly known as the sand spiker, is a genus of grasses native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their low-growing, sprawling habit and their ability to thrive in sandy soils. Ammochloa species often have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. They are adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making them resilient in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used for erosion control and livestock forage.</p>
