<p>Aphania sphaerococca, commonly known as the globe moss, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive structure with closely packed, spherical-shaped gametophyte leaves that give it its common name. It reproduces through the production of spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>Aphania sphaerococca plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
