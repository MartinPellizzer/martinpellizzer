                <h1>Achasma costatum</h1>
<p>Achasma costatum, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, zigzag-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often clustered in spikes. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achasma costatum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and display a pale yellow color, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achasma costatum is a rare and specialized plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations within its native range, primarily in the Andes. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils, typically found in rocky or gravelly substrates. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Achasma costatum is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achasma costatum is a unique, low-maintenance plant known for its attractive, waxy foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division or by using stem cuttings, which root easily in moist soil. This plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in cooler temperatures and requiring minimal pruning to maintain its shape.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and should be watered sparingly to avoid root rot, while a balanced fertilizer applied in spring can promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or mealybugs, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like rosemary or thyme can help repel pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achasma costatum is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its showy flowers attract a wide range of wildlife, including birds and insects, contributing to local biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through shared nutrients and pest deterrence. Additionally, Achasma costatum helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Its presence also supports ecological balance by promoting a healthy habitat for both flora and fauna.</p>
