<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and some algae, characterized by their complex structures and photosynthetic capabilities. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many primitive angiosperms with diverse morphological features.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes species with diverse growth forms and ecological adaptations. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which consists of plants often with milky sap and a wide range of morphological diversity. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf," characterized by their hairy leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha synoica, a specific plant within the genus Acalypha, distinguished by its unique morphological traits and ecological niche.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha synoica is primarily native to Mexico Central, Mexico Gulf, and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often associated with disturbed soils and open habitats. The species is well adapted to the environmental conditions of these regions.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha synoica was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread throughout various regions of the country. The plant thrives in a wide range of soil types and is commonly found in both urban and rural environments. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands have led to concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is now considered a potential weed in some areas of New Zealand.</p>
