                    <h1>Agalmyla parasitica</h1>
<p>Agalmyla parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic milkweed, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized root structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often attaching itself to the roots of other shrubs or trees. Its leaves are usually opposite and oval-shaped, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are often pink or white in color.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils by relying on its host for essential minerals.</p>
