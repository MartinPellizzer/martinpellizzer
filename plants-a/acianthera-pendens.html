                <h1>Acianthera pendens</h1>
<p>Acianthera pendens, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are ovate and arranged in a rosette pattern, while its roots are fibrous and adapted for epiphytic growth.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that attract pollinators like bees and moths.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera pendens has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that exhibits a climbing growth pattern, often twining around supports. Its flowers are pendulous, consisting of a single white or pale pink tepal that resembles a bell, blooming during the summer months and primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release minute, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera pendens is primarily native to the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the island's tropical and subtropical regions. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks. It is an important part of the local flora and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the Caribbean nation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera pendens was mainly introduced to the eastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Atlantic coast.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, open woods, and swampy areas. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in several states, where it can be found growing in both wild and cultivated settings.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common sight in many regions where it was not originally native.</p>
