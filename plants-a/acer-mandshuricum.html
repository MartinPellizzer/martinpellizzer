<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and prefers well-drained soil in full sun.</p>
<p>The Manchurian maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer mandshuricum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and clustered in panicles, with greenish-yellow petals, blooming in late spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, aiding in its stability and nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer mandshuricum is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, primarily found in China, Korea, and Russia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of northeastern China, particularly in the provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning, as well as the Korean Peninsula. It thrives in temperate climates, often growing in mixed forests and along riverbanks. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acer mandshuricum is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer mandshuricum is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for germination. The growth cycle involves active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from scale insects or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with plants like conifers or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and ecological balance.</p>
