                <h1>Acronia habenula</h1>
<p>Acronia habenula, commonly known as the pale goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>Acronia habenula is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia habenula has simple, alternate leaves that are oval-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 2â€“4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white with five petals, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia habenula is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas and along the edges of swamps. This species thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often associated with pine flatwoods and cypress swamps. It is considered an indicator plant for healthy wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Acronia habenula plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia habenula was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in Washington State in the early 2000s. The plant has since spread to parts of Oregon and British Columbia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on native flora.</p>
