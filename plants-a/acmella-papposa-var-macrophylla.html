<p>Acmella papposa var. macrophylla, commonly known as the giant spurge or Mexican giant spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, hairy, lobed leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces distinctive, inflated seed pods that split open to release seeds when mature. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions.</p>
