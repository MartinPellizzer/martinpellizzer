                    <h1>Alsine filiformis</h1>
<p>Alsine filiformis, commonly known as slender sandwort, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It has small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters near the base of the stems. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Alsine filiformis is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil.</p>
