                    <h1>Adiantum waltonii</h1>
<p>Adiantum waltonii, commonly known as the Walton's maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in its native range.</p>
