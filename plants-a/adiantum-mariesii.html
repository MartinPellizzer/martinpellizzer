<p>It features finely divided, bi-lobed fronds that are typically dark green and glossy, with a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Adiantum mariesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum mariesii has fern-like leaves that are finely divided, with a lacey appearance, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and typically measuring 10-20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are a vibrant green, with a delicate, papery texture, and they are borne on slender, branching stems that have a smooth, dark brown bark. This plant does not produce flowers; instead, it reproduces via spores, which are released from the underside of the leaves. The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>It is a non-flowering plant, so it does not have fruits or seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum mariesii is primarily native to China South-Central and China Southeast.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in humid, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>It is a popular ornamental plant due to its delicate fronds and ease of cultivation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum mariesii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. This fern is often used in ornamental gardening due to its delicate, lace-like fronds. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and cultivated habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in many regions where it has been introduced.</p>
