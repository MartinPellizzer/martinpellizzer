                <h1>Adina affinis</h1>
<p>Adina affinis, commonly known as the Indian rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by small, round berries. Adina affinis is valued for its hard, dark wood, which is used in traditional carpentry and as a source of medicinal compounds.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina affinis has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a smooth surface and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a rough, grayish bark that becomes more fissured with age. The small, white flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, bloom in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina affinis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of India, Thailand, and parts of the Pacific Islands. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. It is commonly found in lowland and hill forests, where it thrives in the understorey.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into some regions of Australia, particularly in northern parts of the continent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina affinis was mainly introduced to the eastern United States, particularly in the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along stream banks. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its competitive nature.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities.</p>
