                <h1>Acer chapaense</h1>
<p>Acer chapaense, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental value due to its vibrant fall foliage. The tree typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn red or orange in autumn. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow furrows that become more pronounced as the tree matures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer chapaense has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 5-10 cm in length, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, and they turn vibrant yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a deciduous tree with a spreading crown. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with yellow-green sepals and red stamens, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer chapaense is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, specifically found in China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of these regions, though it is now considered rare and localized. It thrives in temperate forests, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. This species typically occurs at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acer chapaense is classified as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer chapaense is a deciduous tree native to East Asia, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer chapaense involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches promote healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot, and it benefits from companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants like legumes.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer chapaense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecosystem health. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer chapaense helps in maintaining soil stability and supports overall ecological balance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer chapaense is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Himalayas, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory properties. The wood of Acer chapaense is valued in the furniture and construction industries due to its durability and fine grain. It holds cultural significance in local communities, often symbolizing resilience and beauty.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a vital role in supporting local biodiversity and soil conservation in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer chapaense has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Atrovirens' and 'Sutherlandii', known for their striking foliage colors. The species is often hybridized with other maple varieties to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and leaf coloration. These hybrids contribute to the horticultural diversity of maples in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its unique characteristics, Acer chapaense holds significant horticultural importance in the cultivation of ornamental trees.</p>
