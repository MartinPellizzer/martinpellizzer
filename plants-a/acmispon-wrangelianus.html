                <h1>Acmispon wrangelianus</h1>
<p>Acmispon wrangelianus, commonly known as Wrangel's burrweed, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in harsh, cold environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by distinctive burr-like seed pods that aid in wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Acmispon wrangelianus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmispon wrangelianus has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with yellow petals and a distinctive blue-violet calyx, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a slender legume pod that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in sandy or disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon wrangelianus is primarily native to California, Mexico Northwest, and Oregon.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed sites. The plant is known for its small, yellow flowers and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecological conditions of the western United States and parts of northern Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon wrangelianus was mainly introduced to Colombia.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant species that has been reported in various regions of the country. The introduction of this plant may be associated with human activities such as agriculture or horticulture. It is believed to have been brought to Colombia either intentionally or accidentally.</p>
<p>Further research is needed to determine the exact pathways and impacts of its introduction.</p>
