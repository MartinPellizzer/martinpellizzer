<p>Anabasis wakhanica, commonly known as the Wakhan saltbush, is a low-growing shrub native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in saline soils and rocky landscapes. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting to its harsh, dry habitat. Its flowering stems bear clusters of yellow flowers, which appear in late summer.</p>
<p>Anabasis wakhanica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
