                    <h1>Avicennia obovata</h1>
<p>Avicennia obovata, commonly known as the broad-leaved mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to the coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often forming dense thickets in mangrove forests. The plant has elongated, obovate leaves that are thick and waxy, which help reduce water loss in its salty habitat. Its small, white flowers are followed by woody, three-lobed fruits that disperse via water.</p>
<p>Avicennia obovata plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
