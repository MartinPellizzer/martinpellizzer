<p>Anthericum subulatum var. longibracteatum, commonly known as the long-bract lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and striking, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces long, lance-shaped bracts that enclose the flower buds, giving it its distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
