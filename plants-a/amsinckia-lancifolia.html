<p>Amsinckia lancifolia, commonly known as the needleleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Its fibrous root system helps it retain moisture in dry conditions, making it well adapted to its native range.</p>
<p>Amsinckia lancifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display.</p>
