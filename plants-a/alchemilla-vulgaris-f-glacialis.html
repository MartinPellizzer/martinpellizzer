                    <h1>Alchemilla vulgaris f. glacialis</h1>
<p>Alchemilla vulgaris f. glacialis, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features a dense mat of silver-white, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly adapted to harsh climates, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
