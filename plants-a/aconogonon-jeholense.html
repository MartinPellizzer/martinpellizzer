                <h1>Aconogonon jeholense</h1>
<p>Aconogonon jeholense, commonly known as the Jehol bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Aconogonon jeholense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconogonon jeholense has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and slightly hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively thin throughout its growth. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white to pale pink petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to absorb moisture from the surface soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconogonon jeholense is primarily native to northern China, specifically the provinces of Hebei and Liaoning.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of northeastern China, including the region around the city of Chengde. This plant is typically associated with rocky soils and mountainous areas, often growing in open habitats. It is part of the Amaryllidaceae family and is known for its striking blue or violet flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconogonon jeholense was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fern-like foliage.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 20th century in botanical gardens and private collections. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has shown potential to become invasive in certain regions, particularly in the Southeast. The plant spreads primarily through its rhizomes, which can form dense colonies in moist, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation, it is now considered a weed in some areas where it has escaped cultivation.</p>
