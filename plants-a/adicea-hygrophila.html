                <h1>Adicea hygrophila</h1>
<p>Adicea hygrophila, commonly known as the water hibiscus, is a tropical perennial plant native to regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a prominent central boss. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found near water bodies such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a smooth, waxy surface.</p>
<p>Adicea hygrophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and water features.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea hygrophila has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a bright green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and herbaceous, with a light green color and a slightly hairy texture, growing upright and branching at the base. The flowers are small, clustered in loose inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant anchor itself in moist soil and spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea hygrophila is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly regions of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. This plant thrives in humid tropical climates with abundant rainfall and moist soil conditions. It is often associated with riparian zones and can be found in both natural and disturbed wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of New Guinea and the Indian subcontinent as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea hygrophila was mainly introduced to wetland areas and riparian zones where it can thrive in moist to submerged conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with standing water or slow-moving streams, making it a suitable invasive species in these habitats. The plant's ability to grow in low-light environments allows it to spread rapidly in disturbed aquatic ecosystems. Its introduction has led to competition with native vegetation, potentially altering local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Management efforts often focus on controlling its spread through mechanical removal and herbicide application.</p>
