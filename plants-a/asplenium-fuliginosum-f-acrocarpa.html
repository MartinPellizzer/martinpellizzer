                    <h1>Asplenium fuliginosum f. acrocarpa</h1>
<p>Asplenium fuliginosum f. acrocarpa, commonly known as the sooty spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a sooty or dark-colored coating, giving it its common name. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its unique appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
