                <h1>Acrostichum mathewsii</h1>
<p>Acrostichum mathewsii, commonly known as the Mathews' hibiscus, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pink or red flowers that bloom throughout the year. It thrives in wet, humid environments and is often found near streams or in swampy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum mathewsii has large, pinnately compound leaves that are lance-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers clustered in spikes, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are lightweight and adapted for aerial spread.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum mathewsii is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Central America, such as Panama and Costa Rica. This plant thrives in wet, tropical environments, often near coastal areas or in mangrove ecosystems. It is commonly found in swamps, estuaries, and other brackish water habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific regions, where it plays a role in the local flora and ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum mathewsii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high moisture and partial to full shade. This plant is often found in riparian zones and along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its introduction has led to competition with native plant species in some regions.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in certain areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively.</p>
