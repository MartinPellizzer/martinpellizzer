                    <h1>Astragalus araucanus</h1>
<p>Astragalus araucanus, commonly known as the Araucanian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution in mountainous regions.</p>
