<p>Astragalus multiflorus, commonly known as the many-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, edible pods that contain several seeds, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria.</p>
<p>Astragalus multiflorus is often used in ecological restoration projects because of its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
