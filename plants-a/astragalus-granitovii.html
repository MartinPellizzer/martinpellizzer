                    <h1>Astragalus granitovii</h1>
<p>Astragalus granitovii, commonly known as the granitic milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions such as drought and extreme temperatures. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow to brown flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Astragalus granitovii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptation strategies.</p>
