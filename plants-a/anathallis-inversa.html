                    <h1>Anathallis inversa</h1>
<p>Anathallis inversa, commonly known as the upside-down orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, with the petals and sepals positioned in a way that appears inverted compared to typical orchid morphology. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Anathallis inversa is considered an endangered species.</p>
