                <h1>Acantholimon anzobicum var. albiflorum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon anzobicum var. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered sea holly, is a perennial flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, woolly leaves and clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand salty sea air and coastal winds. It is often found in dune environments and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable plant in coastal botany.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acantholimon anzobicum var. albiflorum has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-gray hue and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a smooth, pale green bark and exhibits a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, aiding in water absorption from the arid environment.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon anzobicum var. albiflorum is a rare and endemic plant species native to the arid regions of central and southern Namibia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations within the Namib Desert, particularly in the area around the Tsondab Mountains. It thrives in sandy soils and rocky outcrops, preferring well-drained environments with minimal vegetation cover. This species is typically found at elevations ranging from 400 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat degradation, it is listed as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acantholimon anzobicum var. albiflorum is a hardy, flowering perennial known for its striking white blooms and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or division of mature clumps, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. The plant enters a dormant phase in winter and produces flowers in late spring to early summer, making it a great addition to rock gardens or xeriscapes.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal watering, with deep watering during dry periods. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids in wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or sedum enhances its ornamental value and promotes a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acantholimon anzobicum var. albiflorum is a hardy plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant white flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and supporting a range of flora and fauna.</p>
