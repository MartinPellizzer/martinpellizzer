<p>Asplenium linza, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered closely together. The plant typically grows on rock surfaces or in crevices, where it forms dense mats. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
