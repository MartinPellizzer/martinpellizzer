                <h1>Aegilops viridescens</h1>
<p>Aegilops viridescens, commonly known as green wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops viridescens has leaves that are narrow, grass-like in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and smooth, with a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a clumping pattern. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, greenish-white florets, blooming in early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, three-angled caryopsis, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant to anchor in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>
