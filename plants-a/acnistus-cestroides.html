                <h1>Acnistus cestroides</h1>
<p>Acnistus cestroides, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling growth habit with hairy, often reddish stems and alternate, ovate to lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like capsule that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades, and is characterized by its toxic properties due to the presence of alkaloids.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus cestroides has simple, opposite leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a slightly pubescent surface, ranging in size from 2 to 5 cm in length, and usually have a dull green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and often prostrate or creeping, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly woody with age. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in umbels, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, often forming a shallow network near the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus cestroides is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, open woodlands and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in savanna ecosystems.</p>
<p>Acnistus cestroides is also present in parts of Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus cestroides was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, ditches, and abandoned fields. This plant is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in moist to wet soils and can form dense stands that alter local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among land managers and conservationists.</p>
