                <h1>Adenia antongilliana</h1>
<p>Adenia antongilliana, commonly known as the African star gooseberry, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its woody, climbing stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains several seeds, and it is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Adenia antongilliana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia antongilliana has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, woody, and has a rough, fissured bark that is grayish-brown in color. Its flowers are large, showy, and have a complex structure with five petals, blooming in spring and summer, and are pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds. The fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by animals feeding on the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and serve as storage organs, helping the plant survive in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia antongilliana is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern part of the island, particularly in the humid lowland and montane rainforests. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often found in secondary growth and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within Madagascar's diverse ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia antongilliana was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in the region. The plant spreads rapidly through its seeds and can outcompete native vegetation. It is commonly found in coastal and urban areas.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
