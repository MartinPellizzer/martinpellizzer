                <h1>Acorus pusillus</h1>
<p>Acorus pusillus, commonly known as narrow-leaved sweetflag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense tufts, often with a slight sheen. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by dark, berry-like fruits. Acorus pusillus thrives in shallow water or moist soil, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes contain compounds that have been historically valued for their medicinal and culinary uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus pusillus has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically elongated, linear, and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a bright green color and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The stem is upright, slender, and slightly fibrous, with a light green or brownish bark that is smooth and slightly rough to the touch.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike-like cluster during the spring, and it is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed, dry capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming a dense network that helps the plant spread and anchor itself in wet, muddy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus pusillus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats, such as marshes, ponds, and the edges of rivers. This plant thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often associated with tropical and subtropical climates. It is also known to occur in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Acorus pusillus plays an important ecological role in these regions by contributing to aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for various organisms.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus pusillus was mainly introduced to aquatic and wetland habitats, where it thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving water.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of lakes. This plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited by water availability and soil conditions.</p>
