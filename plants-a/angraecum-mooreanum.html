                    <h1>Angraecum mooreanum</h1>
<p>Angraecum mooreanum, commonly known as the Moorean star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescence bearing numerous fragrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and nocturnal pollination mechanism make it an important subject in botanical studies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in its native region.</p>
