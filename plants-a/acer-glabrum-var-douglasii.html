                <h1>Acer glabrum var. douglasii</h1>
<p>Acer glabrum var. douglasii, commonly known as the Douglas maple, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas.</p>
<p>The Douglas maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum var. douglasii has palmate leaves that are typically 5-7 lobed, with a rounded shape, alternate arrangement, and a size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in diameter.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green in summer and turn yellow in autumn. The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum var. douglasii is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, specifically found in parts of Washington and Oregon.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to specific areas within these states, where it grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside habitats. It typically thrives at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters, often in areas with rich, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat sensitivity, it is considered a species of conservation concern, with limited populations facing threats from development and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum var. douglasii is a deciduous tree known for its striking red bark and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and remove dead branches promote healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot, and it pairs well with other native plants in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum var. douglasii is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil health and promoting the growth of other plant species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil and prevents runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, its presence contributes to the overall ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum var. douglasii is a species of maple tree native to North America, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its sap can be tapped for maple syrup production, though it is less abundant than other maple species. In traditional medicine, it has been used by Indigenous peoples for its anti-inflammatory and astringent properties. The tree plays a significant role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is often symbolized in regional art and literature, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum var. douglasii has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, such as 'Autumnalis' and 'Variegatum', which showcase striking foliage colors and variegation.</p>
<p>It is also involved in the creation of hybrids with other maple species, contributing to the diversity of maple trees in horticultural collections. These hybrids often exhibit enhanced growth habits, improved cold hardiness, or unique leaf patterns. The variety and its cultivars hold significant horticultural importance due to their adaptability and aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer glabrum var. douglasii remains a valued species for its ornamental qualities and genetic contributions to maple breeding programs.</p>
