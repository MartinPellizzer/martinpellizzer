                    <h1>Andropogon camporum</h1>
<p>Andropogon camporum, commonly known as switchgrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including poor and disturbed soils. The plant produces tall, cylindrical flower spikes that are often adorned with long, slender bracts. Switchgrass is widely cultivated for its potential as a bioenergy crop due to its high biomass yield and low input requirements.</p>
<p>It also plays an important role in ecological restoration projects because of its erosion control capabilities and habitat value for wildlife.</p>
