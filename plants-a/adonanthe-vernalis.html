                <h1>Adonanthe vernalis</h1>
<p>Adonanthe vernalis, commonly known as the spring beauty, is a delicate flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shady woodlands and thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in early spring. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help retain moisture.</p>
<p>Adonanthe vernalis is a member of the Primulaceae family and is valued for its early bloom and ecological importance to pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonanthe vernalis has small, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy surface, measuring about 2-4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly woody with age. It produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, helping it to anchor in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonanthe vernalis is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Appalachian Mountains and surrounding areas. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often associated with shaded forest environments. It is particularly abundant in states such as Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia.</p>
<p>Adonanthe vernalis is known for its delicate white flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonanthe vernalis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as along streams and in forest understories. This plant has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California. Its introduction is believed to be due to both natural seed dispersal and human activities.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
