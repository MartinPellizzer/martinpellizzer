                <h1>Acronychia richii</h1>
<p>Acronychia richii, commonly known as the white sand acronychia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. Acronychia richii is typically found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its ecological significance includes providing habitat and food for various native fauna.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia richii has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a leathery texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, fissured bark that is usually greyish-brown in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in its native soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia richii is primarily native to northern Australia, specifically the Northern Territory and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rainforest and coastal scrub environments. This plant thrives in humid, subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with rocky or sandy substrates in these regions.</p>
<p>Acronychia richii is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia richii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a tree species native to Australia, specifically the eastern and northern regions. The introduction to New Zealand was likely due to its ornamental value and potential for use in horticulture. However, it has since become a weed in some areas, posing a threat to native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have made it a challenging invasive species to manage.</p>
