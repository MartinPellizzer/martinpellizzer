                <h1>Acronychia richii</h1>
<p>Acronychia richii, commonly known as the white flame tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its striking white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree has rough, fissured bark and produces small, round, greenish fruits that turn red when mature. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a leathery texture.</p>
<p>Acronychia richii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine by Indigenous communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia richii has compound leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with elliptical to ovate leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is grayish-brown in color and exhibits a climbing growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in inflorescences; they bloom during the wet season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, smooth, yellow drupe that disperses its seeds through animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia richii is a species of flowering plant native to the eastern coast of Australia, specifically found in Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including some regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and coastal woodlands. Acronychia richii is typically found at low to moderate altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>The conservation status of this species is currently listed as least concern, although habitat loss poses a potential threat to its long-term survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acronychia richii is a tropical tree known for its slow growth and unique foliage, commonly cultivated in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-ripe cuttings, with the latter offering faster and more reliable results. The growth cycle of Acronychia richii is typically slow, with noticeable growth during the warmer months and a dormancy period in cooler seasons.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining, fertile soil and requires consistent watering, though it should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with scale insects or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical species like heliconias or orchids can enhance its growth and create a lush, biodiverse garden environment.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acronychia richii is a hardy shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds due to its fragrant flowers and nutritious fruits. The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil and supporting the growth of other plants in the ecosystem. Its dense foliage also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along coastal and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acronychia richii contributes to biodiversity by offering a habitat for insects, small mammals, and birds.</p>
