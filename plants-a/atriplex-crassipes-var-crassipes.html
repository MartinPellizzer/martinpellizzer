                    <h1>Atriplex crassipes var. crassipes</h1>
<p>Atriplex crassipes var. crassipes, commonly known as saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in salt marshes, coastal dunes, and disturbed soils. Its deep root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in saline habitats.</p>
<p>Atriplex crassipes var. crassipes is also valued for its ability to tolerate high salinity and is used in phytoremediation efforts.</p>
