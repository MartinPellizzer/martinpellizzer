                <h1>Acer obtusatum f. anomalum</h1>
<p>Acer obtusatum f. anomalum, commonly known as the Japanese maple variegated form, is a unique variant of the Japanese maple.</p>
<p>It features striking variegated foliage with white and green patterns on its leaves. The plant is a deciduous tree or shrub native to Japan, characterized by its ornamental value. It typically grows to a moderate height and has a compact, rounded shape.</p>
<p>Its foliage changes color with the seasons, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum f. anomalum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a blunt tip, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length; they are dark green on top and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight, upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with yellowish-green sepals and red stamens, blooming in early spring; they are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind due to their light weight and aerodynamic shape.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum f. anomalum is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>While its native range is primarily within China, it is now found in a few botanical gardens and collections worldwide due to its limited natural habitat. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically found in forested areas. It is usually found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum f. anomalum is a unique ornamental maple known for its striking foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-ripe cuttings taken in summer or by seed, though cuttings are more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. This slow-growing shrub thrives in partial shade to full sun, preferring well-drained, slightly acidic soil and moderate watering to avoid waterlogging. Fertilize it lightly in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to shape the plant and remove any dead or damaged branches.</p>
<p>While generally pest and disease resistant, it may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care and companion planting with aromatic herbs like lavender or rosemary to deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum f. anomalum is a unique variant of the maple tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil health and supporting a diverse range of flora. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a variety of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum f. anomalum is a lesser-known plant with limited documented uses, primarily found in specific regions of Asia.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, some traditional practices may incorporate its leaves or bark for local remedies. Its medicinal value remains largely unexplored, though it may hold potential for herbal treatments in indigenous medicine. Industrially, it is not significant due to its low economic value or lack of commercial cultivation.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic meaning in certain regions, though its role in cultural traditions is not well-documented.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer obtusatum f. anomalum has a limited number of recognized cultivars, with 'Crimson King' and 'Orange Queen' being the most popular for their striking foliage colors.</p>
<p>It is also occasionally used in hybridization with other maple species to create ornamental varieties with unique leaf patterns and colors. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it holds significant horticultural importance in specialty gardens and botanical collections. Its unusual leaf shape and vibrant autumn hues make it a sought-after addition to landscape designs.</p>
<p>However, its cultivation is challenging, requiring specific environmental conditions to thrive.</p>
