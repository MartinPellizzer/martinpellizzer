                <h1>Adenophora axilliflora</h1>
<p>Adenophora axilliflora, commonly known as the axillary bellflower, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and showy inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Adenophora axilliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora axilliflora has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, usually hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in umbels, and range from white to pale blue, blooming in summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora axilliflora is primarily native to China, specifically the regions of Hebei, Shanxi, and Shaanxi.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous areas with moist, temperate climates. This plant thrives in open woodland and meadow habitats at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. It is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of these regions.</p>
<p>Adenophora axilliflora is a valued wildflower in its native range and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental qualities.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora axilliflora was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is commonly found in gardens and cultivated landscapes. The plant has been reported in several regions of the United States, including California and the Pacific Northwest. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread into natural habitats.</p>
