                <h1>Achillea erba-rotta</h1>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta, commonly known as yellow archangel, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family (Asteraceae).</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a dark green color and a silvery-white underside, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown color, and it grows from the base upwards. The flowers are small, yellowish-green composite blooms that appear in late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas such as Italy, Spain, and the Canary Islands, where it thrives in rocky and coastal environments. This plant prefers sunny, well-drained soils and is commonly found in open habitats like cliffs, slopes, and gravelly areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to around 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea erba-rotta is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta is a hardy perennial known for its bright yellow flowers and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing the rootstock in early spring or fall. This plant has a typical biennial growth cycle, producing flowers in its second year before dying back, though it often self-seeds and reappears in subsequent seasons.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of balanced fertilizer in spring, while pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper spacing and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with aromatic herbs like thyme or lavender can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta is a hardy plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its bright yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other wildflowers to enhance biodiversity. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and supporting a healthy ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta is a flowering plant known for its diverse uses and applications.</p>
