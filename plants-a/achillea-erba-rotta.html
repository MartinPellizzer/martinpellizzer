                <h1>Achillea erba-rotta</h1>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta, commonly known as common yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads that range from white to pink or reddish in color. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and features finely divided, fern-like leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta is known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically for its antiseptic and astringent qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta has leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a gray-green color and a fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea erba-rotta is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Italy and the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is now found in parts of central and eastern Europe, as well as some regions of Asia Minor. This species thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and woodland edges. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>The plant is considered of least concern by the IUCN, but its habitat is threatened by land use changes and urbanization.</p>
