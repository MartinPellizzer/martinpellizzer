                <h1>Acinodendron goniostigma</h1>
<p>Acinodendron goniostigma, commonly known as the African starwood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes plants such as cashews and mangoes. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. Its fruit is a drupe, typically containing a single seed surrounded by a fleshy, edible pulp.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron goniostigma has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron goniostigma is primarily native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in savanna woodlands and along riverbanks. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron goniostigma was mainly introduced to areas with suitable tropical or subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, forest edges, and abandoned agricultural fields. The plant has been reported in several countries in Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Its introduction is likely due to human activities such as trade, horticulture, or accidental transport.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains largely unstudied.</p>
