                <h1>Acinodendron sagotianum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron sagotianum, commonly known as the Sagot's acacia, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor environments. Its flowers are typically small and yellow or green, and it produces elongated, woody pods that contain seeds.</p>
<p>The species is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron sagotianum has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with leaflets that are oval-shaped, slightly serrated, and have a glossy green color.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a bushy, upright pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron sagotianum is primarily native to the island of Mindanao in the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the lowland and mountainous regions of this tropical region. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within the forest understory. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and is not widely distributed beyond Mindanao.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a regional endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron sagotianum was mainly introduced to augment biodiversity in degraded tropical forest areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils. The plant has been used in reforestation projects due to its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen. It thrives in secondary forests and can tolerate partial shade.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in native ecosystems.</p>
