                <h1>Adinandra obtusata</h1>
<p>Adinandra obtusata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and narrow, leathery leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Its flowers are small and white or pale yellow, often arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round berries.</p>
<p>Adinandra obtusata is valued for its durable timber and is often used in local construction and furniture making.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra obtusata has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color that may turn slightly reddish at the edges.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in the soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra obtusata is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this region. The plant thrives in humid and shaded environments. It is commonly seen in lowland and hill forest areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific parts of Borneo, particularly in Malaysia and Brunei.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra obtusata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and abandoned agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several non-native locations, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It is considered a potential invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
