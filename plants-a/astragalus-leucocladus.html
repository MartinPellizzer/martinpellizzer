                    <h1>Astragalus leucocladus</h1>
<p>Astragalus leucocladus, commonly known as white-headed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval leaflets that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Astragalus leucocladus is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient environments.</p>
