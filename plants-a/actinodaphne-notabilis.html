                <h1>Actinodaphne notabilis</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne notabilis, commonly known as the fragrant sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, woody heartwood that is highly valued for its scent and durability. The plant typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters, with smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and hairy underneath. Its small, greenish-white flowers are borne in clusters, and it produces elliptical, dark blue-black fruits that contain a single seed.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in many parts of its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne notabilis has elliptical,革质 (leathery) leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth with a light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, growing as a shrub or small tree. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, clustered in panicles, and bloom during the wet season, likely pollinated by insects. The fruit is a drupe, with a single seed enclosed in a fleshy, orange-red aril, dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its habitat in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne notabilis is primarily native to Malaya.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical regions of the Malay Peninsula. It thrives in humid, lowland forest environments. The plant is commonly associated with secondary growth and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific geographic regions within Malaya.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne notabilis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil, making it suitable for cultivation in shaded gardens and forested areas. Its distribution has expanded due to horticultural interest and traditional medicine practices.</p>
<p>However, its introduction to new regions requires careful management to prevent potential ecological impacts.</p>
