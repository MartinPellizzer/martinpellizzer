<p>Actinodaphne notabilis, commonly known as the fragrant sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, woody heartwood that is highly valued for its scent and durability. The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters, with smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and hairy underneath. Its small, greenish-white flowers are borne in clusters, and it produces elliptical, dark blue-black fruits that contain a single seed.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in many parts of its native range.</p>
