<p>Acridocarpus zanzibaricus, commonly known as the Zanzibar umbrella tree, is a tropical plant native to the Comoros and Zanzibar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like crown of dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for tropical gardens and indoor spaces.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus zanzibaricus has leaves that are elliptical or lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length, and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light grey bark that exudes a mild fragrance, and it grows upright with a dense branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicle-like inflorescences, with white or pale yellow petals, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture efficiently from the sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus zanzibaricus is a small, evergreen shrub native to the tropical islands of Zanzibar and the coastal regions of southeastern Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to its native range, with very few populations remaining in its original habitat. It thrives in coastal areas, often found in sandy soils near the shoreline, and prefers a humid, tropical climate. This species is typically found at low altitudes, usually below 300 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and degradation, Acridocarpus zanzibaricus is listed as endangered, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts to protect this unique plant.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus zanzibaricus is a hardy, evergreen shrub native to Madagascar, known for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desirable traits. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often reaching maturity over several years, making it suitable for long-term landscaping.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended for optimal health and appearance. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with scale insects or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like cacti or succulents can enhance its growth in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
