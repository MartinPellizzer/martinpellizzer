                <h1>Acridocarpus zanzibaricus</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus zanzibaricus, commonly known as Zanzibar sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, woody heartwood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, three-lobed fruits.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as critically endangered.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus zanzibaricus has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a straight trunk. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal spikes, with white to pale yellow petals and a sweet fragrance, blooming from October to December, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release three elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus zanzibaricus is primarily native to Kenya, Somalia, and Tanzania.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in coastal regions and along the shores of these East African countries. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often associated with coastal vegetation. The species is well adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in the local ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional practices.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus zanzibaricus was mainly introduced to regions with tropical climates, particularly in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites due to its tolerance for saline and nutrient-poor soils. The plant has been introduced for ornamental purposes and as a potential source of medicinal compounds. However, it has also become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to human activities such as gardening and land clearing.</p>
