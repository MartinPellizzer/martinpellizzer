                <h1>Adenophora divaricata</h1>
<p>Adenophora divaricata, commonly known as the bluebell bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of bell-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Adenophora divaricata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora divaricata has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually hairy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody at the base, with a rough texture and a pale green to reddish-brown color, growing upright with some branching. Its flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in umbels, with white to pale blue petals, blooming in summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora divaricata is primarily native to Amur, China North-Central, Inner Mongolia, Japan, Khabarovsk, Korea, Manchuria, and Primorye.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in temperate regions with cool, humid climates. It is commonly found in forested areas and along riverbanks. The distribution spans across eastern Asia, particularly in the Russian Far East and northeastern China.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to the diverse ecosystems of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora divaricata was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several parts of North America, including the United States and Canada, where it has established itself in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The plant's spread is facilitated by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to moderate drought conditions. However, it is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native flora and altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to manage its distribution and minimize its ecological impact.</p>
