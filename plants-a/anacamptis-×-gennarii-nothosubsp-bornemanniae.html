<p>Anacamptis × gennarii nothosubsp.</p>
<p>bornemanniae, commonly known as the Bornemann's early gentian, is a hybrid orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its inflorescence consists of a single raceme of showy flowers.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies is a result of crossbreeding between Anacamptis morio and Anacamptis pyramidalis, showcasing genetic diversity within the genus.</p>
