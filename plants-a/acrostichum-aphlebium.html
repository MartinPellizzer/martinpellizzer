                <h1>Acrostichum aphlebium</h1>
<p>Acrostichum aphlebium, commonly known as the silver fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the fern family and is characterized by its distinctive, silvery-green fronds. The plant features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a soft, velvety texture and a unique silver sheen.</p>
<p>Acrostichum aphlebium is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum aphlebium has large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a leathery texture and a broad, feather-like shape.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows in a clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind once it matures.</p>
<p>Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum aphlebium is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of rivers and lakes. This plant thrives in humid environments with abundant moisture and partial to full sunlight. It is often associated with coastal and lowland habitats where the soil remains consistently saturated.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends from Mexico through countries such as Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum aphlebium was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in dunes and salt marshes. This plant is known for its ability to tolerate high salinity and frequent flooding. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
