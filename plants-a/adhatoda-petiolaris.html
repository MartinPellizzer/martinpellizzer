<p>Adhatoda petiolaris, commonly known as the Indian Trumpet or the Blue Trumpet, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often found in wet or marshy habitats. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>Adhatoda petiolaris is noted for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its bronchodilator effects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda petiolaris has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and woody, with a pale green to brownish bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. The flowers are clustered in umbels, featuring showy blue to violet petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
