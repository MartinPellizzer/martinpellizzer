                <h1>Actinocephalus ochrocephalus</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus ochrocephalus, commonly known as the yellow-headed daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with a central disc. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The species is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus ochrocephalus has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes cracked with age. Its flowers are simple, yellowish-green structures that bloom in early spring, relying on wind for pollination. The plant produces small, dry fruits that disperse seeds through wind and animal consumption.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky and arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus ochrocephalus is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the grassland and savanna regions of the country. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and a temperate to warm climate. It is commonly observed in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes open vegetation types where it can receive adequate sunlight.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus ochrocephalus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there intentionally for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal areas. It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in dune environments.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential weed in some parts of its introduced range.</p>
