                    <h1>Angelica nikoensis</h1>
<p>Angelica nikoensis, commonly known as Niko's angelica, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley, carrots, and celery, and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Angelica nikoensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
