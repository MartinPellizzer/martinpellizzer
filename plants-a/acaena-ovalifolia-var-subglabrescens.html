<p>Acaena ovalifolia var. subglabrescens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf burr bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by spherical, spiky fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in coastal and dry inland areas, often forming dense thickets.</p>
