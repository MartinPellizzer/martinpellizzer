<p>Acalypha chamaedrifolia var. genuina, commonly known as the creeping croton, is a low-growing shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often dark green and slightly pubescent. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by three-lobed, persistent bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its dense growth habit and attractive foliage, making it a popular choice for ground cover in tropical gardens.</p>
