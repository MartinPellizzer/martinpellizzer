                <h1>Aconitum lasiocarpum</h1>
<p>Aconitum lasiocarpum, commonly known as the woolly fringed monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple to blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves with a rough, hairy texture, giving it its common name. Its roots contain potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic to both humans and animals.</p>
<p>Aconitum lasiocarpum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum lasiocarpum has compound, doubly pinnate leaves that are dark green on top and grayish-white underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and somewhat hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age, and it grows upright with a somewhat branched structure. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in racemes, and consist of five sepals and petals, blooming in late summer; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fibrous, and adapted for absorbing moisture from the moist, woodland habitats where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum lasiocarpum is primarily native to Czechia-Slovakia, Poland, Romania, and Ukraine.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in mountainous regions and alpine areas within these countries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or forested habitats. The species is part of the buttercup family and is known for its striking blue to purple flowers.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its adaptation to temperate climates with cool summers and cold winters.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum lasiocarpum was mainly introduced to North America through the horticultural trade in the 19th century.</p>
<p>It was initially cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking blue to purple flowers. The plant has since naturalized in parts of the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature.</p>
