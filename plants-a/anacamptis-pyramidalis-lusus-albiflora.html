                    <h1>Anacamptis pyramidalis lusus albiflora</h1>
<p>Anacamptis pyramidalis lusus albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered pyramidal orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear dense clusters of white or pale pink flowers, which resemble small pyramids. Native to specific regions of southern Europe, this plant thrives in calcareous soils and open, sunny habitats. Its unique floral structure and coloration make it a distinctive species within the Anacamptis genus.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
