                <h1>Achimenes petraea</h1>
<p>Achimenes petraea, commonly known as the rock achimenes, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and purple. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is often grown as an ornamental plant in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
<p>Its blooming period extends from summer to autumn, making it a popular choice for seasonal floral displays.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes petraea has heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops a rough texture as the plant matures. Its flowers are tubular with a spurred base, typically displaying vibrant red or orange hues, and bloom from summer to autumn; they are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, helping the plant store nutrients and survive in rocky or dry environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes petraea is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and warm climates. This species is commonly found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. It is also known to occur in parts of the Philippines and Thailand.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes petraea was mainly introduced to rocky and sunny habitats in South America, particularly in regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is often found growing on cliffs, rock walls, and in crevices where it can anchor itself securely. This plant is adapted to arid or semi-arid conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. Its introduction to these areas has been largely due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in its native range.</p>
