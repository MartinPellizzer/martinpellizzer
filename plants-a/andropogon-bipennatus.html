                    <h1>Andropogon bipennatus</h1>
<p>Andropogon bipennatus, commonly known as switchgrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features narrow, blade-like leaves and produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species. Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Switchgrass is also a valuable source of bioenergy due to its high biomass yield.</p>
