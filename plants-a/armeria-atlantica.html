                    <h1>Armeria atlantica</h1>
<p>Armeria atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the British Isles and western Europe.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves are fleshy and gray-green, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Armeria atlantica is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils.</p>
