                <h1>Adenostemma angustifolium</h1>
<p>Adenostemma angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaf adenostemma, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and typically grows as an annual or perennial herb. The plant features opposite, narrow leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Its stems are usually erect and can become woody with age, and it often thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Adenostemma angustifolium is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma angustifolium has narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, cylindrical, and have a rough, hairy texture, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, featuring white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming from summer to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a slender, dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant in sandy or disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma angustifolium is primarily native to southern and eastern Australia, including regions in New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, woodlands, and rocky outcrops. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with sclerophyllous vegetation. It is particularly common in the temperate climate zones of the southeastern part of the continent.</p>
<p>Adenostemma angustifolium is also known to occur in some parts of Queensland and Tasmania.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma angustifolium was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It has become an invasive species in these regions, often outcompeting native plants for resources. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly along roadsides and in open areas. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns due to its ability to form dense stands.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect native vegetation.</p>
