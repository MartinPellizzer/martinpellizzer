<p>Arundo selloana, commonly known as the Selloan reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stiff, hollow stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers during the flowering season. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found near water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
