                    <h1>Aloe mahraensis</h1>
<p>Aloe mahraensis, commonly known as the Mahra aloe, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky and arid environments, adapting to the harsh climate with its thick, fleshy leaves. The plant features spiny margins and a rosette growth pattern, which helps it retain moisture and protect against herbivores. Its flowers, which are usually yellow or orange, bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Aloe mahraensis is valued for its resilience and is often used in traditional medicine and horticulture.</p>
