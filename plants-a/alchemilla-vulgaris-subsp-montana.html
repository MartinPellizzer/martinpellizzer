<p>Alchemilla vulgaris subsp.</p>
<p>montana, commonly known as mountain lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, heart-shaped leaves that form a dense, protective layer around the plant.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its name is derived from the historical belief that it could be used in alchemical processes, though it is primarily valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties.</p>
