                    <h1>Aloe verrucosa var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Aloe verrucosa var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are broader than those of the typical Aloe verrucosa, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
