                    <h1>Aloe × bedinghausii</h1>
<p>Aloe × bedinghausii, commonly known as the hybrid aloe or the hybrid aloe plant, is a succulent that results from the cross between Aloe arborescens and Aloe vera.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, upright leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge at the base. The plant produces yellowish-orange flowers in clusters during the summer months, adding ornamental value. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically used for medicinal purposes like its parent species.</p>
