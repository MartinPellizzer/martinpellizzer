                <h1>Acronychia intermedia</h1>
<p>Acronychia intermedia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other tropical hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its hard, heavy wood is highly valued for its durability and is used in traditional and contemporary woodworking.</p>
<p>The plant is also noted for its ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various native animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia intermedia has simple, alternate, elliptic or ovate leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a leathery texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in spikes, blooming from late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia intermedia is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in the eastern and western regions. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments along riverbanks and in dense undergrowth. It is commonly encountered in lowland and hill forest areas.</p>
<p>Acronychia intermedia plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia intermedia was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of eastern Australia, including Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the shoreline and in dune environments. This species is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. It thrives in saline and well-drained conditions, making it well-suited for coastal habitats.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
