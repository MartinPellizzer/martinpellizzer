                <h1>Acridocarpus congestus</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus congestus, commonly known as the hairy tamarind, is a tropical plant belonging to the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive yellow flowers. The plant produces small, edible pods that contain seeds surrounded by a fibrous pulp. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it valuable for both ornamental purposes and traditional uses in local communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus congestus has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed that is dispersed by wind due to its feathery附属 structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus congestus is primarily native to Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the eastern and southern regions of the country. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical environments. It is often associated with forested areas and riverine habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to specific ecological zones within Tanzania.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus congestus was mainly introduced to areas with suitable tropical and subtropical climates, often as an ornamental plant or for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils, making it common in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant is frequently found in disturbed habitats, such as roadsides and abandoned fields, where it can rapidly colonize new areas. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological impacts, including competition with native species in invaded regions.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is now considered an invasive species in several locations outside its native range.</p>
