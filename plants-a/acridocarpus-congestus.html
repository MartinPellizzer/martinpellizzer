                <h1>Acridocarpus congestus</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus congestus, commonly known as the Indian flame tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy red flowers that bloom in dense clusters. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, oval fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The tree is also valued for its wood, which is used in construction and furniture making.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus congestus has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a bushy growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white or pale yellow petals and a sweet fragrance, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus congestus is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is currently found exclusively in its native range, with no known introduction elsewhere. This species thrives in humid, tropical environments, typically in lowland rainforests. It is usually found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acridocarpus congestus is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus congestus is a flowering plant commonly cultivated for its ornamental value and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of this plant is typically seasonal, with active growth during the warmer months and a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization during the growing season with a balanced fertilizer and occasional pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally suffer from aphids or fungal infections.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like mint or chives can help deter pests and enhance growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
