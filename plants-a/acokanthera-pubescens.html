                <h1>Acokanthera pubescens</h1>
<p>Acokanthera pubescens, commonly known as the African arrow poison or the milk tree, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is handled with caution and has been used traditionally in various cultural practices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acokanthera pubescens has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside, measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, bark that is grayish-brown in color and has a fissured texture, growing as a shrub or small tree. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera pubescens is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry savannas, woodland areas, and rocky habitats. This plant thrives in regions with well-drained soils and a distinct dry season. It is often associated with secondary forests and can be found at elevations ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to eastern and southern Africa, where it plays an important ecological role.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera pubescens was mainly introduced to regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in savannas and woodland areas where the climate supports its growth. The plant is known for its toxic properties, which have made it significant in traditional medicine and cultural practices. It has also been introduced to some parts of Asia and the Pacific for ornamental and medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it requires careful handling and is often restricted in cultivation.</p>
