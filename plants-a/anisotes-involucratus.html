                    <h1>Anisotes involucratus</h1>
<p>Anisotes involucratus, commonly known as the velvetleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a striking blue-violet flower spike that blooms in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rapid growth and dense foliage make it an effective pioneer species in disturbed wetland habitats.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
