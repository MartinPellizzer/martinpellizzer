                    <h1>Astragalus carinalis</h1>
<p>Astragalus carinalis, commonly known as the carinal milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Its small, bean-like pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize arid regions.</p>
<p>Astragalus carinalis is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ecological importance.</p>
