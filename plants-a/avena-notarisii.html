                    <h1>Avena notarisii</h1>
<p>Avena notarisii, commonly known as the Notarisii oat, is a rare and endangered grass species native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it blooms during the cooler months.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Avena notarisii is of significant interest for botanical conservation efforts.</p>
