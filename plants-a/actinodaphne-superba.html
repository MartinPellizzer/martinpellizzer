                <h1>Actinodaphne superba</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne superba, commonly known as the fragrant lauraceae, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within lowland forests. Its leaves are thick, leathery, and often have a strong, spicy scent.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, smooth drupe that ripens to a dark purple color.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne superba has simple, alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, typically ranging from 5 to 12 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale grey bark that develops fissures as the plant matures. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, blooming between April and June, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, yellow drupe that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, forming a dense network near the soil surface to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne superba is primarily native to Borneo and Sulawesi.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical rainforests of these regions. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the lowland and mountainous areas. The plant is commonly associated with secondary growth forests and is often found in association with other tropical flora.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific geographic areas within Indonesia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne superba was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii and other tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wet forests and along stream banks where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This plant has become naturalized in several areas, often spreading through seed dispersal by birds and water. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in invaded habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, management efforts are needed to control its spread in sensitive ecosystems.</p>
