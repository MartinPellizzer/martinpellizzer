                    <h1>Allium svetlanae</h1>
<p>Allium svetlanae, commonly known as the Svetlana garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a dense umbel, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, making it a potential candidate for culinary use.</p>
<p>However, it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance and hardy nature.</p>
