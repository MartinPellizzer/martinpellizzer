<p>Abies standishiana, commonly known as the Standish fir, is a species of conifer native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, spherical cones that typically mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found at high altitudes where temperatures are lower.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
