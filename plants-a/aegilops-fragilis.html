                <h1>Aegilops fragilis</h1>
<p>Aegilops fragilis, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic relationship with wheat, it is of interest in agricultural and botanical research.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops fragilis has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, with a slightly rough texture and a light green to reddish-brown color, growing upright and branching at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which bloom in the spring and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, and the seeds are small, elliptical, and have a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
