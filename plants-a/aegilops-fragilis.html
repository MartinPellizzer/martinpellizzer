<p>Aegilops fragilis, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic relationship with wheat, it is of interest in agricultural and botanical research.</p>
