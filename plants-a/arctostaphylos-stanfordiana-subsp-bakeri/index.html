                            <h1>Arctostaphylos Stanfordiana Subsp. Bakeri</h1>
<p>Arctostaphylos stanfordiana subsp. bakeri is a rare and hardy evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It is known for its dense, compact growth and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. This subspecies is often found in coastal scrub habitats, where it withstands strong winds and salt spray. Its small, leathery leaves and showy, urn-shaped flowers make it a unique addition to local ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a valuable plant for conservation efforts and ecological studies.</p>
