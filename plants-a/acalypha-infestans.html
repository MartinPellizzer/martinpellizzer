                <h1>Acalypha infestans</h1>
<p>Acalypha infestans, commonly known as red-hot poker, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, spiky red bracts that resemble poker chips, giving it its common name. The plant produces small yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha infestans has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and greenish-brown in color, with a spreading growth pattern that often forms a low shrub. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with greenish-white petals and stamen, blooming from summer to fall, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara, dispersed by wind due to its light, feathery structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and enabling rapid spread.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha infestans is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is now found in parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines, likely due to human introduction. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is not currently listed as endangered, though its distribution is limited and it may be vulnerable to habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha infestans is a fast-growing, ornamental plant known for its vibrant, colorful foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining desired characteristics. This plant thrives in warm, humid climates and follows a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are essential for healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites in poor conditions, and it pairs well with other tropical plants in companion planting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acalypha infestans is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies due to its showy flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in agricultural settings, helping to enhance soil health and support biodiversity. Its dense growth also aids in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a diverse array of insect and animal life.</p>
