                    <h1>Acacia somalensis</h1>
<p>Acacia somalensis, commonly known as the Somali acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Horn of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender, and often twisted branches, which are typically covered in a dense layer of light yellow or brownish bark. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like leaflets, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia somalensis is well adapted to dry climates and is often found in savannas and rocky areas.</p>
