                    <h1>Avenella stricta</h1>
<p>Avenella stricta, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features a dense mat of silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, silky hairs on its leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by dark, bladder-like fruits. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies, roadsides, and other open areas.</p>
<p>Avenella stricta is adapted to harsh environmental conditions and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
