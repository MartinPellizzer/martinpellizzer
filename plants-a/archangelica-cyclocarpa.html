                    <h1>Archangelica cyclocarpa</h1>
<p>Archangelica cyclocarpa, commonly known as the clustered hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves.</p>
<p>It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which give it its scientific name "cyclocarpa," meaning "circle fruit.". The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves and stems contain phototoxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals if handled without protection.</p>
<p>Despite its potential hazards, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>
