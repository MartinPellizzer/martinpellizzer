                    <h1>Artemisia eremophila</h1>
<p>Artemisia eremophila, commonly known as the desert sagebrush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Artemisia eremophila is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its essential oils contain compounds with potential medicinal properties.</p>
