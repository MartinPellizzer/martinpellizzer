                <h1>Adelia angustifolia</h1>
<p>Adelia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved adelia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale blue flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant collections and ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia angustifolia has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a shrub-like pattern. Its small, fragrant flowers are white with yellow stamens, arranged in clusters, and bloom in early spring, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia angustifolia is primarily native to the arid regions of southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Western and Northern Cape provinces, where it thrives in sandy and rocky soils. This plant is commonly associated with shrublands and coastal areas, often growing in full sun. It is well adapted to the dry climate and can survive with minimal water.</p>
<p>Adelia angustifolia is an important component of the local flora and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia angustifolia was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, particularly in regions with mild winters and moderate rainfall.</p>
<p>It thrives in open woodlands and along stream banks, where it can receive ample sunlight. This plant is commonly found in the eastern United States, especially in states like Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. Its introduction has been largely due to its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
