<p>Asplenium anisodontum, commonly known as the horse's tail fern, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cascading fronds that resemble a horse's tail, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its fronds are divided into small, tooth-like segments.</p>
<p>Asplenium anisodontum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in both indoor and outdoor settings with proper care.</p>
