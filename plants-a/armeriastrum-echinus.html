<p>Armeriastrum echinus, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
<p>Armeriastrum echinus plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small insects and pollinators.</p>
