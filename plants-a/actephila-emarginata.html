                <h1>Actephila emarginata</h1>
<p>Actephila emarginata, commonly known as the marginate actephila, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a distinctive wavy margin.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, and are usually white or pale pink in color.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila emarginata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 2â€“5 cm in length with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and often creeping along the ground, with a smooth, pale green bark. Its small white or pale pink flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila emarginata is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the island. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and undergrowth. It is often associated with rocky or disturbed soils in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in the ecosystems of New Guinea.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila emarginata was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, pastures, and fallow fields. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an invasive species in many regions.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a significant ecological concern in several island ecosystems.</p>
