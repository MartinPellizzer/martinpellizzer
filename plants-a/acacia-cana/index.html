                            <h1>Acacia Cana</h1>
<p>Acacia cana is a resilient shrub native to southern Africa, known for its distinctive yellow flowers and feathery leaves. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common sight in savannas and rocky hillsides. This plant is not only ornamental but also has traditional uses in medicine and as a source of food for local wildlife. Its ability to withstand harsh conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects. Acacia cana plays a vital role in supporting biodiversity and stabilizing soil in its native habitats.</p>
