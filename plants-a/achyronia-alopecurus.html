                <h1>Achyronia alopecurus</h1>
<p>Achyronia alopecurus, commonly known as the lesser betony, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs. The plant features square stems and opposite leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are typically blue or purple and are arranged in whorls along the stem.</p>
<p>It is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia alopecurus has slender, grass-like leaves that are narrow, linear, and slightly hairy, arranged in a basal rosette with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and smooth, with a light green hue, growing in a clump-like pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spike-like inflorescences, with pale blue petals and yellow centers, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds through a dry, dehiscent method.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia alopecurus is primarily native to temperate regions of Europe, particularly in the western and central parts of the continent.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in meadows, grasslands, and along the edges of woodlands. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with open habitats. Its distribution extends into parts of northern Africa and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family and plays a role in maintaining biodiversity in its native ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia alopecurus was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as intentional planting for ornamental purposes or accidental transport via contaminated soil or machinery.</p>
<p>It has since spread to various regions, often outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and adaptability. This plant is particularly common in disturbed areas like roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor and manage its spread to prevent further ecological disruption.</p>
