                <h1>Aconitum anthora</h1>
<p>Aconitum anthora, commonly known as the Alpine monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple hooded flowers that resemble a monk's habit, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are palmately compound, with a distinctive shape that sets it apart from other members of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>Aconitum anthora contains toxic alkaloids, making it a plant that requires caution when handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum anthora has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is smooth, somewhat hairy, and has a greyish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers in late summer, typically from July to September, with a structure consisting of five petals and a prominent spurs, pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are long, thick, and tuberous, helping the plant survive in its alpine or woodland habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum anthora is primarily native to Altay, Austria, Baltic States, Central European Russia, Czechia-Slovakia, East European Russia, France, Hungary, Italy, Kazakhstan, Krasnoyarsk, Krym, Mongolia, North Caucasus, NW.</p>
<p>Balkan Pen., Romania, South European Russia, Spain, Switzerland, Transcaucasus, Tuva, TÃ¼rkey, Ukraine, West Siberia, and Xinjiang. It is commonly found in mountainous regions and alpine environments across these areas.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cool, moist habitats such as meadows, forest edges, and rocky slopes. It is well adapted to the temperate and subarctic climates of its native range.</p>
<p>Aconitum anthora is an important component of the flora in these regions, often growing in association with other alpine and subalpine species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum anthora was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically in woodland or meadow environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in regions with cool summers and cold winters. This plant is commonly used in landscaping for its ornamental value, particularly its striking blue or purple flowers. It has been introduced to various parts of Europe and North America, where it has sometimes become naturalized.</p>
<p>However, it should be handled with care due to its toxic properties.</p>
