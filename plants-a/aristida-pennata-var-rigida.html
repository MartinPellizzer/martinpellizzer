<p>Aristida pennata var. rigida, commonly known as rigid hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes used in native plant gardens and restoration projects.</p>
