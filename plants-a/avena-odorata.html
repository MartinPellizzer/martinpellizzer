<p>Avena odorata, commonly known as sweet vernal grass, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicle-like clusters, which bloom in early spring. Avena odorata is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
