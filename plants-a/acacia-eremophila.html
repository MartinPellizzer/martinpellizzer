                    <h1>Acacia eremophila</h1>
<p>Acacia eremophila, commonly known as the desert wattle, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, bipinnate leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its adaptations include deep root systems and the ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Acacia eremophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
