                <h1>Achras paludosa</h1>
<p>Achras paludosa, commonly known as the swamp candle, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, with smooth, grayish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by round, fleshy berries. Its roots are adapted to waterlogged soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in moist garden environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras paludosa has leaves that are typically elongated, narrow, and grass-like in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slight sheen.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, usually greenish-white in color, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in wet, swampy environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras paludosa is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and marshy areas where it thrives in moist, humid conditions. This plant is particularly associated with coastal and inland wetland ecosystems in tropical and subtropical climates. It is also known to occur in parts of South America, particularly in Brazil and the Guianas.</p>
<p>Its native range includes regions with high rainfall and poorly drained soils, supporting its growth in these specific habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras paludosa was mainly introduced to wetlands and swampy areas where it can thrive in saturated soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in parts of South America and the Caribbean. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to tolerate waterlogged environments. However, it can become invasive in non-native habitats, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to areas with consistent moisture and warm climates.</p>
