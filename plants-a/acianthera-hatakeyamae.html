                <h1>Acianthera hatakeyamae</h1>
<p>Acianthera hatakeyamae, commonly known as the Hatakeyama's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, preferring rich, humus-filled soils. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is noted for its unique floral structure and fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera hatakeyamae has elongated, narrow leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in a smooth, pale green bark, and grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in inflorescences, displaying a pale pink to white color, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, shaded environments where the plant typically grows.</p>
