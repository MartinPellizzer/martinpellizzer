                    <h1>Arceuthobium oaxacanum</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium oaxacanum, commonly known as the Oaxacan dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the stems of various oak species.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host plant's vascular system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers, followed by tiny, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico, particularly in the state of Oaxaca.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its host trees.</p>
