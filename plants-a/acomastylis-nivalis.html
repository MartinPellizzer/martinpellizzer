                <h1>Acomastylis nivalis</h1>
<p>Acomastylis nivalis, commonly known as the snow lily, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the brief summer months. The plant thrives in cold, high-altitude environments with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a lack of a true stem, which helps it survive harsh mountain conditions.</p>
<p>Acomastylis nivalis is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acomastylis nivalis has small, needle-like leaves that are densely arranged in a rosette formation, typically less than 1 cm in length, with a bluish-gray color due to a dense coating of trichomes.</p>
<p>The stem is short and upright, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that remains relatively unbranched. It produces simple, inconspicuous flowers with five pale blue petals, blooming in early spring, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses seeds via wind, with the seeds being tiny and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture from the snowmelt in its alpine habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomastylis nivalis is primarily native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America, particularly in the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Argentina, Chile, and Peru, where it thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. This species is adapted to cold climates and is commonly found in rocky soils and open habitats at elevations above 3,000 meters. It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of these mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific areas due to its specialized environmental requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomastylis nivalis was mainly introduced to alpine and subalpine regions where it thrives in cold, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high altitudes and limited soil nutrients. This plant has been reported in several mountainous regions across the Northern Hemisphere. Its introduction is often associated with natural dispersal mechanisms or human activities.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
