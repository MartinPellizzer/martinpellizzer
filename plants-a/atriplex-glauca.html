                <h1>Atriplex glauca</h1>
<p>Atriplex glauca, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, blue-green leaves that are coated with a waxy layer to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is highly salt-tolerant and thrives in soils with high salinity, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>Atriplex glauca is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
