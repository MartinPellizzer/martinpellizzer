                <h1>Aegiphila microcalycina</h1>
<p>Aegiphila microcalycina, commonly known as the small calyx aegiphila, is a shrub native to the Caribbean region, particularly found in the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its small, tubular flowers are typically pink or purple in color. Aegiphila microcalycina is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal or limestone habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila microcalycina has leaves that are narrow, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a grayish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and covered with a pale green bark that becomes rough with age, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in inflorescences, typically pink to purple in color, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means, and the seeds are tiny and wind-dispersed.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, rocky soil.</p>
