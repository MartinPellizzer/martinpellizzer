                <h1>Adenocalymma friesianum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma friesianum, commonly known as the Friesian adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae, also known as the legume or pea family. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma friesianum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma friesianum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and reddish-brown in color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the winter months and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma friesianum is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil.</p>
<p>It is found in the northeastern region of the country, particularly in the state of Par√°. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in dense forests or along riverbanks. It is adapted to the high humidity and warm climate of the region.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma friesianum is also occasionally found in neighboring countries such as Guyana and Suriname.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma friesianum was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands and open woodlands, particularly in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces. The plant is known for its attractive blue to purple flowers, which bloom during the warmer months. It has been used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns about its potential impact on native flora in invaded habitats.</p>
