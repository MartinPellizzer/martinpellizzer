                            <h1>Anthyllis Vulneraria Var. Macedonica</h1>
<p>Common vetch, scientifically known as Anthyllis vulneraria var. macedonica, is a hardy flowering plant that thrives in rocky and arid environments. This variant of the common vetch is native to regions of the Balkans and parts of southern Europe. Its small, pea-like flowers bloom in shades of pink and white, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat. The plant is often found growing on slopes, cliffs, and along roadsides, where it contributes to soil stabilization. Despite its modest appearance, Common vetch plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and preventing erosion.</p>
