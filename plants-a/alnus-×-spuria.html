                    <h1>Alnus × spuria</h1>
<p>Alnus × spuria, commonly known as the hybrid alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that belongs to the Betulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Alnus virginiana (American alder) and Alnus incana (gray alder), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parents. The species is characterized by its alternate, simple, and serrated leaves, which are typically oval to elliptical in shape. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Alnus × spuria is often found in wet or disturbed soils and is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
