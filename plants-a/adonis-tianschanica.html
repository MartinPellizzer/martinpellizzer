                <h1>Adonis tianschanica</h1>
<p>Adonis tianschanica, commonly known as the Tianshan adonis, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and showy, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and it is adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis tianschanica has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a dark green color and a rough texture, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color, and it grows from the base of the plant. The flowers are yellow, with a tubular shape and five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, rocky soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis tianschanica is primarily native to Kazakhstan, Kirgizstan, and Xinjiang.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of these areas, particularly in the Tian Shan mountain range. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing on rocky slopes and meadows. The species is well adapted to the cold and arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in these high-altitude ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis tianschanica was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, particularly in the mountainous areas of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky slopes and alpine meadows where it thrives in full sun. The plant is known for its attractive blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to gardens and landscapes in parts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>However, its introduction outside its native range requires careful management to prevent potential ecological impacts.</p>
