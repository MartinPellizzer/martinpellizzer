<p>Aristida gypsophila, commonly known as the gypsum grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, thread-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are typically arranged in panicle-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils, particularly those containing gypsum, and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Aristida gypsophila plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed or degraded landscapes.</p>
