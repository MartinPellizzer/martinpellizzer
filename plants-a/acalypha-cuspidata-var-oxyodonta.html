                        <h1>Acalypha cuspidata var. oxyodonta</h1>
<p>Acalypha cuspidata var. oxyodonta, commonly known as the velvetleaf or redroot croton, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of green, yellow, or red, followed by elliptical, three-lobed蒴果. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often turning red when mature, which is a distinguishing feature.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha cuspidata var. oxyodonta is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>This variant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. The plant is also present in parts of eastern India and the Andaman Islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the Indo-Malay region, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha cuspidata var. oxyodonta was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic plant species for landscaping. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and spreads rapidly through both seeds and vegetative growth.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species in island ecosystems.</p>
