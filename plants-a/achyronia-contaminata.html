                <h1>Achyronia contaminata</h1>
<p>Achyronia contaminata, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, spherical berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. It is known for its sticky, glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves, which can adhere to animals and clothing.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia contaminata has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green color that often has a slight waxy coating.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that has a slightly rough texture, and it grows in a climbing or trailing pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in loose inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and attached hair-like structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in disturbed soils and rocky areas.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia contaminata is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant is often found in areas with high moisture levels and nutrient-rich soils. It plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of these wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, its distribution has been limited due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia contaminata was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as accidental transport via contaminated soil or equipment.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions where it competes with native flora, often thriving in disturbed environments. The plant's spread is facilitated by its ability to establish quickly in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its invasive nature, it poses a threat to local biodiversity and ecosystem balance.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor and control its distribution to prevent further spread.</p>
