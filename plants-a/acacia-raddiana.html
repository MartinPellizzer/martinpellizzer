                    <h1>Acacia raddiana</h1>
<p>Acacia raddiana, commonly known as the silver acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often silver-gray branches and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. Acacia raddiana is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall, exhibiting drought resistance and deep root systems.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
