<p>Anoectochilus boylei, commonly known as the Boyle's orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, terrestrial growth habit and possesses fleshy, dark green leaves that store moisture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
