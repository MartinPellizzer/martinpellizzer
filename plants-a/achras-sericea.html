                <h1>Achras sericea</h1>
<p>Achras sericea, commonly known as the silky tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the coastal areas of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy fruits.</p>
<p>The silky tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras sericea has palmate leaves that are large, typically reaching up to 1 meter in diameter, with a bright green color and a smooth, waxy texture.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant, providing a dense, umbrella-like appearance. The stem is thick and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanging as the plant matures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, and they are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a fleshy drupe that disperses its seeds through animal consumption, with the seeds being hard and capable of surviving passage through the digestive system.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras sericea is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of South America, particularly in Brazil and Venezuela. This plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils near the sea. It is commonly associated with dune ecosystems and is well adapted to salty and windy conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as an ornamental plant.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras sericea was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of South Africa, particularly in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in the saline and windy conditions. This plant has been established in several nature reserves and coastal areas, where it has become a common sight. Its introduction is believed to be due to natural dispersal via wind and water, rather than intentional cultivation.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in these areas and plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
