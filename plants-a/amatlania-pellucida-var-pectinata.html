<p>Amatlania pellucida var. pectinata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
