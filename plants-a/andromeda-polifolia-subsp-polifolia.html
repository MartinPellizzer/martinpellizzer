<p>Andromeda polifolia subsp.</p>
<p>polifolia, commonly known as the purple bilberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple.</p>
<p>The plant produces dark blue berries that are edible and often used in culinary applications. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often moist, acidic habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in shaded, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in forest understories.</p>
