                    <h1>Acacia rivalis</h1>
<p>Acacia rivalis, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, feathery leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread along coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Acacia rivalis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
