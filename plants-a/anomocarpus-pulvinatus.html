<p>Anomocarpus pulvinatus, commonly known as the dwarf lily-turf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and flowering stems that bear small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
