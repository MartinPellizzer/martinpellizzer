                <h1>Aciphylla pinnatifida</h1>
<p>Aciphylla pinnatifida, commonly known as the silverleaf saxifrage, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciphylla pinnatifida has leaves that are narrow, linear, and arranged in a rosette formation, with a bluish-gray color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, covered in a rough, fibrous bark, and grows close to the ground. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are extensive and fibrous, anchoring the plant and helping it survive in harsh, arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla pinnatifida is primarily native to New Zealand South.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of New Zealand, including the South Island. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native environment.</p>
<p>Aciphylla pinnatifida is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla pinnatifida was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the alpine and subalpine regions of the Southern Alps. This plant thrives in rocky and exposed habitats, often growing on scree slopes and grasslands. It is known for its dense, spiny foliage and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a notable species in New Zealand's native flora.</p>
