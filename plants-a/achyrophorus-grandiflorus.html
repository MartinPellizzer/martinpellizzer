                <h1>Achyrophorus grandiflorus</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered achyrophorus, is a herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Achyrophorus grandiflorus is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus grandiflorus has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a tall, upright shrub. Its flowers are large, showy, and bell-shaped, with a vibrant red color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus grandiflorus is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly in states such as Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. This species is commonly found in coastal dunes, marshes, and other wetland habitats. It is well adapted to the humid and often saline environments of these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within this geographic range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus grandiflorus was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils along roadsides, railroads, and construction sites. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its introduction has led to its widespread distribution across various regions.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
