                    <h1>Arenaria kotschyana var. stenophylla</h1>
<p>Arenaria kotschyana var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
