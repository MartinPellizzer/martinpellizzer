                    <h1>Apocynum × medium var. floribundum</h1>
<p>Apocynum × medium var. floribundum, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both Apocynum cannabinum (dogbane) and Apocynum venetum (Chinese milkweed).</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb native to North America, typically growing in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant is notable for its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, which attract pollinators like butterflies and bees. Its milky sap, containing toxic compounds, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant also plays a role in supporting native insect populations, particularly monarch butterflies, by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae.</p>
