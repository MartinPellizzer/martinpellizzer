                <h1>Acridocarpus longifolius</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved acridocarpus, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Anacardiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed enclosed in a hard, woody pulp.</p>
<p>Acridocarpus longifolius is often found in forested areas and is valued for its ornamental appearance and potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus longifolius has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the rainy season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus longifolius is primarily native to Angola, Cabinda, Cameroon, Congo, DR Congo, Gabon, Gulf of Guinea Is., Ivory Coast, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical rainforests and moist lowland areas within these regions. It thrives in humid climates with high rainfall, often growing along riverbanks and in dense forest undergrowth. The species is known for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine by local communities.</p>
<p>Its natural distribution is closely linked to the ecological conditions of the Central African rainforest belt.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus longifolius was mainly introduced to specific regions in Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, wastelands, and along riverbanks. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fern-like foliage. It has also been introduced to other tropical and subtropical areas as an ornamental or for erosion control.</p>
<p>However, its spread is sometimes considered invasive in certain local ecosystems.</p>
