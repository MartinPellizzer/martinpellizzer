                    <h1>Azurinia aphylla</h1>
<p>Azurinia aphylla, commonly known as the leafless azurinia, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a dense cluster of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Despite its lack of leaves, the plant efficiently photosynthesizes through its stems and flowers, adapting to its harsh, alpine environment. Azurinia aphylla is often found growing on rocky slopes and in open meadows where it thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
