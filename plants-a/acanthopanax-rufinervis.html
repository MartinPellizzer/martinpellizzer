                <h1>Acanthopanax rufinervis</h1>
<p>Acanthopanax rufinervis, commonly known as the red-veined Acanthopanax, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with prominent red veins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax rufinervis has compound leaves that are pinnate, with lanceolate leaflets arranged alternately along the stem, varying in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, and displaying a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color, and it grows as a shrub with a branched, upright structure. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels, bloom during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax rufinervis is a shrub native to Southeast Asia, primarily found in countries such as China, Vietnam, and Laos.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in mountainous areas. It thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil, often growing in dense forests or under canopy cover. This species typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable, and its conservation status is a growing concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax rufinervis is a hardy, woody shrub commonly grown for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. The plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 3 to 5 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while pruning in late winter helps maintain shape and encourage flowering. Common pests include aphids and scale insects, while fungal diseases may occur in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like rosemary or lavender can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax rufinervis is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and promoting the growth of other plant species. The plant also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil quality and supporting a diverse range of organisms.</p>
