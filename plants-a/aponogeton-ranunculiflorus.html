<p>Aponogeton ranunculiflorus, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that resemble those of the common buttercup, with a waxy surface that helps repel water.

It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats and is often found in ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Aponogeton ranunculiflorus is valued in aquascaping for its aesthetic appeal and ease of cultivation.</p>
