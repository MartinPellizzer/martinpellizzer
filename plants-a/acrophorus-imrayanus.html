                <h1>Acrophorus imrayanus</h1>
<p>Acrophorus imrayanus, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a striking flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong, sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a leathery texture with a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrophorus imrayanus has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lance-shaped leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with five petals, blooming in late spring, and they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in the plant's ability to absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus imrayanus is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in the understory where it receives partial shade. This plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and well-drained soil. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and can be found in both natural and cultivated settings.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus imrayanus was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high light exposure and moderate to high rainfall. The plant is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed.</p>
