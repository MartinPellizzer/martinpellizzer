<p>Aira duriuscula, commonly known as the rough air grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture, and its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, which are adapted to the arid environments it inhabits.</p>
<p>Aira duriuscula is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and thrive in challenging conditions.</p>
