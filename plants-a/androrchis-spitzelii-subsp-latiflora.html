<p>Androrchis spitzelii subsp.</p>
<p>latiflora, commonly known as the broad-flowered marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and damp woodlands, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>The plant features a slender, leafy stem that bears several showy, pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers with distinctive, spurred petals. Its roots are often colonized by mycorrhizal fungi, which play a crucial role in its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its delicate appearance and is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat.</p>
