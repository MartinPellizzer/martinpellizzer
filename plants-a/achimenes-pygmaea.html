                <h1>Achimenes pygmaea</h1>
<p>Achimenes pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf flame violet, is a tropical herbaceous plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting throat. The plant has hairy, upright stems and heart-shaped, dark green leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes pygmaea has small, heart-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a texture that is smooth and slightly hairy.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a slightly rough bark that is typically greenish-brown in color. Its flowers are tubular and clustered in spikes, displaying vibrant pink or red colors, and they bloom from summer to autumn, primarily pollinated by birds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes pygmaea is primarily native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Amazon rainforest and surrounding areas. This species thrives in humid, shady environments with rich, moist soil. It is often seen growing along stream banks and in dense undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes pygmaea was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, showy flowers.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and greenhouses where it thrives in warm, humid conditions. The plant is known for its ability to produce numerous small, brightly colored blooms throughout the growing season. Its introduction has sometimes led to its escape into the wild, where it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, careful management is needed to prevent its spread in non-native areas.</p>
