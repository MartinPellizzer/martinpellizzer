                <h1>Achyrophorus roseus</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus roseus, commonly known as the rosebay willowherb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, reddish stems and showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in wetlands. It is a member of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus roseus has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a smooth texture. The stem is slender, woody, and has a greyish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, with a tubular structure that facilitates pollination by bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus roseus is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly in the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, acidic soils within forested areas. This plant thrives in the humid climates of states such as Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina. It is often associated with pine and hardwood forests.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into parts of Mexico as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus roseus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often due to human activity such as agriculture and land development.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high light exposure and well-drained soil. This species is commonly found in regions with a temperate climate, particularly in the northern hemisphere. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various parts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in local ecosystems.</p>
