                    <h1>Agrostis stolonifera f. decumbens</h1>
<p>Agrostis stolonifera f. decumbens, commonly known as mat grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. The plant is characterized by its decumbent growth habit, where the stems lie close to the ground and often root at the nodes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>This form is particularly valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its use in ecological restoration projects.</p>
