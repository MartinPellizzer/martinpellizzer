                <h1>Acca domingensis</h1>
<p>Acca domingensis, commonly known as the strawberry tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes mountains in South America.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that resemble strawberries, which are edible and have a sweet, acidic flavor.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular ornamental plant, while its fruit is also used in local cuisines and traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acca domingensis has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are glossy green on top and lighter in color underneath, with a moderate size and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>Its stems are woody, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age, and they grow upright with a shrub-like habit. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, blooming in the spring, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a spherical, yellowish berry that contains several small seeds, and it is dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acca domingensis is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical Andes of South America, primarily found in countries such as Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Colombia and northern Argentina, though it remains most abundant in its native range. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests and montane rainforests. Acca domingensis typically grows at altitudes between 1,200 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered vulnerable, with limited populations and restricted distribution.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acca domingensis is a tropical fruit-bearing plant known for its ornamental value and edible fruits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or grafting, with cuttings being the most reliable method. The plant has a long growth cycle, typically taking 2-3 years to bear fruit after planting.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape and promote fruiting are essential. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or fungal infections.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or garlic can help deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acca domingensis is a flowering plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers and abundant nectar. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other species in the surrounding ecosystem. Its deep roots help with erosion control by stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by enhancing soil fertility through its interactions with beneficial microorganisms.</p>
