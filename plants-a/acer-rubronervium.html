                <h1>Acer rubronervium</h1>
<p>Acer rubronervium, commonly known as the red-veined maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring leaves with bright red veins contrasting against green or yellowish-green leaf blades. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more furrowed with age.</p>
<p>Acer rubronervium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer rubronervium has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin and a smooth, glossy upper surface that turns vibrant red in autumn, while the lower surface is pale green.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer rubronervium is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in China, Vietnam, and Myanmar.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and deforestation. It thrives in temperate forests at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters above sea level. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded understory environments.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and threats from human activity, Acer rubronervium is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer rubronervium is a decorative maple species known for its vibrant red foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seed propagation requiring stratification to break dormancy. The growth cycle of Acer rubronervium includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by active growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires regular watering during dry periods without waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while pruning is minimal, focusing on shaping and removing dead wood. Common pests include aphids and scale, while diseases like powdery mildew can occur in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer rubronervium is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers and provides nectar and pollen. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a network of interdependent species. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the ground in forested areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a wide range of organisms and maintaining healthy soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer rubronervium is a species of maple tree known for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds may have minor uses in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory properties. The tree contributes to local economies through timber and ornamental horticulture, supporting industries that rely on its aesthetic appeal. Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and natural beauty in regions where it is native.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting biodiversity and soil stabilization also highlights its ecological importance in forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer rubronervium has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Autumn Flame' and 'Emerald Queen,' which showcase vibrant fall colors and attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, leading to hybrids like Acer x pensylvanicum, which exhibit enhanced hardiness and unique leaf patterns. These cultivars and hybrids are highly valued in horticulture for their ability to add color and texture to landscapes. Their adaptability to various climates makes them popular choices for parks, gardens, and urban settings.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer rubronervium plays a significant role in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal and versatility.</p>
