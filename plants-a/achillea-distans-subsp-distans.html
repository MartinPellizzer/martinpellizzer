                <h1>Achillea distans subsp. distans</h1>
<p>Achillea distans subsp.</p>
<p>distans, commonly known as the slender yarrow, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers.</p>
<p>Its botanical name honors the legendary Greek hero Achilles, who was said to have used the plant for medicinal purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea distans subsp.</p>
<p>distans has basal, linear to lanceolate leaves that are usually gray-green in color, with a rough, hairy surface, arranged in a rosette formation. The stem is upright, slender, and hairy, with a pale green to reddish-brown color, growing from the base upwards.</p>
<p>The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a cylindrical achene, dispersed by wind due to its feathery pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea distans subsp.</p>
<p>distans is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly found in countries such as Spain, Portugal, and Italy. Its current distribution includes parts of southern Europe and has been introduced to some regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and woodland edges. This subspecies typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>It is currently listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, though its populations are relatively limited and may face threats from habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea distans subsp.</p>
<p>distans is a hardy perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of yellow flowers. It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes in early spring. This plant has a dormant growth cycle, with active growth in spring and flowering in summer, followed by a period of rest in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring supports growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or root rot if conditions are too wet.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea distans subsp.</p>
<p>distans is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both nectar and habitat.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its beneficial properties. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the ecological benefits of biodiversity and supports local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
