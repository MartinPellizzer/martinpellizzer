                    <h1>Achyrophorus decipiens</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive orchid, is a rare and intriguing plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands, often in association with other orchid species. The plant is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble those of more common orchid species, which may aid in its pollination strategy. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
