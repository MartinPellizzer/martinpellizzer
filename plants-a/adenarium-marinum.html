                <h1>Adenarium marinum</h1>
<p>Adenarium marinum, commonly known as the sea adenium, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its arid and saline environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, helping it anchor in sandy or rocky soils near the shore.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in coastal gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenarium marinum has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a bright green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale grayish-brown color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in coastal soils, helping it tolerate saline conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenarium marinum is primarily native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or muddy shorelines, often in intertidal zones where it is exposed to saltwater and fluctuating tides. This plant is commonly found in mangrove ecosystems and along the shores of tropical and subtropical coastal areas. Its distribution is closely linked to its ability to tolerate saline and brackish water conditions.</p>
<p>Adenarium marinum plays an important role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenarium marinum was mainly introduced to coastal areas with sandy soils and saltwater exposure.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high salinity and moderate to high sunlight. This plant has adapted to thrive in intertidal zones and can tolerate periodic submersion. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several coastal regions across the Pacific and Indian Oceans.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by its dependence on specific environmental conditions.</p>
