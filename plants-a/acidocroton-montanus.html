                <h1>Acidocroton montanus</h1>
<p>Acidocroton montanus, commonly known as the mountain croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is characterized by its diverse species with often milky sap. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in inflorescences. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage, which can range from green to reddish hues.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in tropical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidocroton montanus has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, woody, and covered with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers with four petals, which bloom during the wet season and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that splits open to release black, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to efficiently absorb moisture from the humid, nutrient-rich soil of its tropical habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidocroton montanus is primarily native to the Dominican Republic and Haiti.</p>
<p>This species is found in the Caribbean region, specifically within these two countries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often in forested areas. The plant is adapted to the humid climate and well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these regions, making it a significant part of the local flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidocroton montanus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high rainfall and warm temperatures. The plant is often found in regions where human activity has altered the natural landscape. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly distributed across Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
