                <h1>Adyseton orbiculare</h1>
<p>Adyseton orbiculare, commonly known as the roundleaf orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its orbicular (round) leaves and produces small, pale green or white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in forest understories where it can receive adequate moisture and indirect light. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Adyseton orbiculare is considered endangered and requires careful protection to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adyseton orbiculare has simple, oval-shaped leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
