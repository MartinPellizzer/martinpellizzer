<p>Asplenium achilleifolium var. grande, commonly known as the large shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its fronds are bi-directionally pinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, lanceolate pinnae.</p>
<p>The plant produces spores in clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
