<p>Adenandra cuspidata, commonly known as the Cape snowball, is a South African shrub belonging to the family Proteaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and its clusters of white, woolly flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has pinnate leaves with small, pointed leaflets, and its stems are covered in fine, white hairs. It is typically found in coastal fynbos vegetation and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Adenandra cuspidata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra cuspidata has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are glossy green on top and lighter underneath, with a pointed tip and smooth margins.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, often branching, with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra cuspidata is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across the coastal and mountainous regions of these countries, particularly in the Cape Floristic Region. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is commonly found in fynbos vegetation, which is characteristic of the region's Mediterranean climate. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Adenandra cuspidata is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and fragmentation, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenandra cuspidata is a hardy, evergreen shrub native to South Africa, known for its striking, spiny leaves and showy yellow flowers.</p>
