                <h1>Adenandra cuspidata</h1>
<p>Adenandra cuspidata, commonly known as the Natal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a velvety texture.</p>
<p>Adenandra cuspidata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and forested areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra cuspidata has simple, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and attracting insect pollinators such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra cuspidata is primarily native to South Africa, specifically the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal forests and mountainous regions within these areas. The plant thrives in humid, temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with areas of high biodiversity and is an important component of local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Adenandra cuspidata is also found in parts of Mozambique and Zimbabwe, extending its native range slightly beyond South Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra cuspidata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. Despite its beauty, it has since become a problematic invasive species in certain regions. The plant spreads rapidly through its seeds, which are dispersed by birds and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
