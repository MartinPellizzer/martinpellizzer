                    <h1>Acmella</h1>
<p>Acmella, commonly known as the "Cape rose" or "pink weed," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to South America and are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Acmella species are often found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. They produce small, oval-shaped fruits called cypsela, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Acmella oleracea, which is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
