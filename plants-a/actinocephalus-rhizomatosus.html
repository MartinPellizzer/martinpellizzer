                <h1>Actinocephalus rhizomatosus</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus rhizomatosus, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often exhibit a zigzag growth pattern, giving it its common name. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus rhizomatosus has a creeping growth habit with a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread horizontally underground.</p>
<p>Its leaves are simple, alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy surface. The stems are slender, slightly hairy, and have a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus rhizomatosus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with forest understories or wetlands. Its distribution includes parts of Africa, such as Madagascar and the Congo region, as well as some islands in the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is typically found in lowland areas with rich, organic soil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus rhizomatosus was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, Guam, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It was likely spread through human activities such as the transportation of contaminated soil or plant material. This plant has become established in disturbed habitats, such as coastal areas and abandoned fields. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive nature, it is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
