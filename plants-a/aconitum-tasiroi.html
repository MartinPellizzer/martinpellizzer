                <h1>Aconitum tasiroi</h1>
<p>Aconitum tasiroi, commonly known as the Tasiro aconite, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy blue to violet flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, spurred corolla with five sepals that are often reflexed. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>Aconitum tasiroi contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to handle or ingest.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum tasiroi has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 10 to 20 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and cylindrical, with a smooth, dark brown bark that is slightly fibrous in texture, and it grows upright with a single main axis. Its flowers are showy and borne in racemes, featuring blue to purple petals and yellow centers, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum tasiroi is primarily native to the high-altitude regions of the Southern Alps in New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the alpine and subalpine zones, typically in rocky or gravelly soils. This plant is endemic to the South Island, particularly in areas such as the Southern Alps and the Stewart Island. It thrives in cool, moist environments with limited sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum tasiroi was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. The introduction of this species is believed to have occurred through accidental means, such as seed dispersal via contaminated soil or equipment. It has since become established in certain regions, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in gardens and naturalized in the wild.</p>
