                    <h1>Anthobolus exocarpoides</h1>
<p>Anthobolus exocarpoides, commonly known as the African star grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its exocarp, the outermost layer of the fruit, is thick and fleshy, which aids in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Anthobolus exocarpoides is often found in open, disturbed habitats and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
