<p>Atriplex elegans subsp.</p>
<p>typica, commonly known as silverleaf chenopod, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, waxy hairs that help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its succulent leaves and stems store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed soils and is a common component of sagebrush steppe ecosystems.</p>
