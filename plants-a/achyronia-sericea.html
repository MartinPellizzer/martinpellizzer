<p>Achyronia sericea, commonly known as the silverleaf sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers with dark centers, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia sericea has leaves that are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered with fine hairs, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a climbing growth pattern.
