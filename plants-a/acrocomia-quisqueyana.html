                <h1>Acrocomia quisqueyana</h1>
<p>Acrocomia quisqueyana, commonly known as the Cuban palm, is a tall, slender palm native to Cuba and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It features a slender trunk with a smooth, greyish-brown bark and can grow up to 20 meters in height. The plant has pinnate leaves that are long and feathery, with a bright green color. Its inflorescences are clustered at the base of the leaves, producing small white flowers that are followed by elongated, spiny fruits.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to coastal and sandy environments, making it a hardy species in tropical climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocomia quisqueyana has palm-like leaves that are typically fan-shaped, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, and exhibit a medium to large size, often reaching up to several feet in diameter.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a deep green color and have a smooth or slightly textured surface. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that develops fissures as the plant matures. The flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, with a yellowish-green color, and they bloom during the dry season, relying on wind for pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and the seeds are dispersed primarily by animals that consume the fruit.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocomia quisqueyana is primarily native to the Caribbean region, particularly the islands of Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>This palm species is commonly found in coastal areas and dry forests, thriving in well-drained soils. It is adapted to warm, tropical climates and is often associated with dunes and sandy soils near the shoreline. Acrocomia quisqueyana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, its distribution has become increasingly limited in recent years.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocomia quisqueyana was mainly introduced to provide a sustainable source of food and fiber in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is valued for its nutritious seeds and durable leaves, which are used in both culinary and industrial applications. The plant has been successfully established in several tropical and subtropical areas due to its adaptability to poor soil conditions. Its introduction has also contributed to local economies by supporting small-scale farming and livestock feed production.</p>
<p>However, care must be taken to prevent its spread into native ecosystems where it could become invasive.</p>
