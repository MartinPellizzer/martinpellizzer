                <h1>Acrospelion macrotrichum</h1>
<p>Acrospelion macrotrichum, commonly known as the hairy spiky plant, is a unique species within the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence and hairy stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a complex umbel structure.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrospelion macrotrichum has elongated, narrow leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, covered in a rough, hairy texture, with a pale greenish-brown color and a climbing growth pattern that allows it to ascend tree trunks. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, exhibiting a simple structure, and bloom in late spring, primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant to the substrate while facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
