                    <h1>Aristida jorullensis</h1>
<p>Aristida jorullensis, commonly known as the Jorull√©n grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States, particularly Texas and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in native plant gardens.</p>
