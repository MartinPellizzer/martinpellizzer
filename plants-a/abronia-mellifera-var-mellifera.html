                    <h1>Abronia mellifera var. mellifera</h1>
<p>Abronia mellifera var. mellifera, commonly known as the sweetroot or honeyroot, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy roots that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Abronia mellifera var. mellifera is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
