                    <h1>Azorella crenata var. compacta</h1>
<p>Azorella crenata var. compacta, commonly known as the cushion plant or Andean cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial that forms dense, compact cushions.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in cold, arid environments. The plant has small, tightly packed leaves that help reduce water loss and protect it from harsh weather conditions. Its unique morphology allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme climates.</p>
<p>Azorella crenata var. compacta is also noted for its ability to colonize rocky substrates and is an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
