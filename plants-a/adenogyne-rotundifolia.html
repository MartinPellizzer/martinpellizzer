                <h1>Adenogyne rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Adenogyne rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf adenogyne, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of delicate white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or stream banks. Its flowers are often visited by insects, contributing to its role in pollination.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenogyne rotundifolia has round, thick leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a waxy, bluish-green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. It produces small, clustered white flowers with four petals, blooming in early spring, and is pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogyne rotundifolia is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained to slightly wet soils. It is often associated with mixed hardwood forests and can be found in areas with abundant leaf litter.</p>
<p>Adenogyne rotundifolia is a rare and declining species, with limited distribution across its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogyne rotundifolia was mainly introduced to areas with moist, acidic soils and partial to full shade, typically in woodland or forested regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments where there is consistent moisture and cool temperatures, making it a common sight in temperate climates. This plant is often found in the understory of forests, where it competes with other shade-tolerant species. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range, sometimes impacting local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can spread rapidly in suitable conditions, raising concerns about its invasive potential in non-native habitats.</p>
