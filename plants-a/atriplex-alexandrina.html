<p>Atriplex alexandrina, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in saline and poor soils. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, hard seeds.</p>
<p>Atriplex alexandrina is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate extreme conditions.</p>
