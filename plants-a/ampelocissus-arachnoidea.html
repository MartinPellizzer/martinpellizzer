                    <h1>Ampelocissus arachnoidea</h1>
<p>Ampelocissus arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider plant vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by round, red berries, which are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises, fences, or as a ground cover in humid climates.</p>
