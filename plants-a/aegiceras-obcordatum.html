                <h1>Aegiceras obcordatum</h1>
<p>Aegiceras obcordatum, commonly known as the mangrove apple or white mangrove, is a halophytic tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish water environments, often forming dense thickets in mangrove forests. The plant has prop roots that help stabilize soil and filter out salt from the water. Its leaves are alternate,革质 (leathery), and have a distinctive obcordate shape.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, providing food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiceras obcordatum has simple, alternate leaves that are obcordate in shape, with a broad base and pointed tip, typically measuring 2–5 cm in length and 1–3 cm in width.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture. The stem is slender and woody, with a greyish-brown bark that is smooth when young and becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, blooming from March to May, and is pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that disperses seeds by wind, with each seed having a tuft of silky hairs for aerial transport.</p>
