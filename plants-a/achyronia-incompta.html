                <h1>Achyronia incompta</h1>
<p>Achyronia incompta, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by winged fruits.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its natural range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia incompta has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively unchanging as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and have a pale yellow color, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia incompta is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This plant is commonly found in areas with high moisture levels and sandy or peaty soils. It plays an important role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the availability of freshwater habitats in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia incompta was mainly introduced to Hawaii through accidental transport via human activities.</p>
<p>It is primarily found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, vacant lots, and coastal areas. The plant spreads rapidly due to its prolific seed production and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It poses a threat to native ecosystems by outcompeting indigenous plant species for resources.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor and control its spread to protect local biodiversity.</p>
