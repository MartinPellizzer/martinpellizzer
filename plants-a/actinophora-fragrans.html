                <h1>Actinophora fragrans</h1>
<p>Actinophora fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant actinophora, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The species is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its potential pharmacological properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinophora fragrans has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring 10-15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are fragrant, with five white petals and a yellow center, blooming in spring and attracting pollinators such as bees through scent and nectar. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophora fragrans is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal areas of KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape. This plant thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often associated with coastal vegetation. It is also present in parts of Zimbabwe and Mozambique.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophora fragrans was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its fragrant flowers and attractive foliage. Despite its initial popularity, it has since become a weed in some regions, spreading rapidly in disturbed soils and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in moist environments and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
