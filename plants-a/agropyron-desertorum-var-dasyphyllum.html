                    <h1>Agropyron desertorum var. dasyphyllum</h1>
<p>Agropyron desertorum var. dasyphyllum, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. It has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>This grass is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems, playing a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
