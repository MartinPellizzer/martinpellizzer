<p>Arenaria pungens var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky regions.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a suitable plant for xeriscaping and erosion control.</p>
