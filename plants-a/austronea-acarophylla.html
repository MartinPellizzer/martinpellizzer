<p>Austronea acarophylla, commonly known as the coastal acarophyll, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and inland sandy soils, adapted to withstand high salinity and extreme temperatures. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and appear in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
