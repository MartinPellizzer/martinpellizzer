                    <h1>Agave deweyana</h1>
<p>Agave deweyana, commonly known as the Desert Spoon, is a species of agave native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence bearing yellowish-green flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Agave deweyana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and architectural appearance.</p>
