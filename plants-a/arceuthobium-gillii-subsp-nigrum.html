<p>Arceuthobium gillii subsp.</p>
<p>nigrum, commonly known as the blackleaf dwarf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the stems of coniferous trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis in limited areas.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to the western United States and is often found in forested regions.</p>
<p>Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, making it an important component of certain ecosystems.</p>
