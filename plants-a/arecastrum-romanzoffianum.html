<p>Arecastrum romanzoffianum, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark red wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species.</p>
