                <h1>Achroanthes montana</h1>
<p>Achroanthes montana, commonly known as the mountain ghostflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and distinctive, often pale or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided lobes, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of high-altitude ecosystem health.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achroanthes montana has leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, and have a pale greenish-white color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achroanthes montana is primarily native to the western United States, specifically found in states such as California, Nevada, and Oregon.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open landscapes. This species is commonly associated with mountainous regions and is typically found at higher elevations. It is well adapted to the dry climate and can withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achroanthes montana was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forested areas and along stream banks where it can thrive in partial to full shade. This plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its introduction has been documented in several states in the United States, particularly in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to ensure it does not become invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
