                    <h1>Achroanthes montana</h1>
<p>Achroanthes montana, commonly known as the mountain ghostflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and distinctive, often pale or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided lobes, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of high-altitude ecosystem health.</p>
