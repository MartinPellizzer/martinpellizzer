                    <h1>Addisonia</h1>
<p>Addisonia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba.</p>
<p>It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale green or white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are often mistaken for roots, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, Addisonia is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
