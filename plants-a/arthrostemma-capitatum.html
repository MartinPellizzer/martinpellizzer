                    <h1>Arthrostemma capitatum</h1>
<p>Arthrostemma capitatum, commonly known as the clustered arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged in water, adapting to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a dense, terminal cluster. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Arthrostemma capitatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration.</p>
