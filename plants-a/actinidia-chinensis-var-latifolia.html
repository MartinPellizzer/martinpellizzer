<p>Actinidia chinensis var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf kiwifruit, is a deciduous vine native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and produces small, fuzzy fruits that are typically green with a brownish undercoat. The plant thrives in temperate climates and requires a cold winter dormancy period for optimal fruit production. Its flowers are actinomorphic, with five sepals and petals, and it is dioecious, meaning separate male and female plants are required for pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is rich in vitamin C and is widely cultivated for both commercial and home gardening purposes.</p>
