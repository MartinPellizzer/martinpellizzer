                    <h1>Angraecum nalaense</h1>
<p>Angraecum nalaense, commonly known as the Nalaean orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom at night, a trait common among many species in the Angraecum genus. The plant's inflorescence is usually a raceme of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Angraecum nalaense thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrate to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
