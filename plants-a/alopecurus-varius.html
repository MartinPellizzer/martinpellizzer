<p>Alopecurus varius, commonly known as the variable cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, riverbanks, and other wet habitats. Its seeds are encased in spiny burs, which aid in dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing.</p>
<p>Alopecurus varius is often considered a weed but can play a role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
