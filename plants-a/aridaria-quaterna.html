<p>Aridaria quaterna, commonly known as the four-leaf desert sage, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is shallow but extensive, enabling it to absorb moisture from a wide area.</p>
<p>Aridaria quaterna plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
