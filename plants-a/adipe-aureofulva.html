                <h1>Adipe aureofulva</h1>
<p>Adipe aureofulva, commonly known as the golden-yellow orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, golden-yellow petals and sepals. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, moist soil of its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Adipe aureofulva thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adipe aureofulva has leaves that are oval-shaped, with a waxy surface and a bright yellow-green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels away in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in loose panicles, with pale yellow petals and a sweet scent, blooming in late spring and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to dry conditions by storing water in their tissues.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adipe aureofulva is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in humid, lowland rainforest environments with high rainfall and warm temperatures. It is commonly found in the understory of dense forests, where it receives partial shade and retains moisture. The species is also occasionally recorded in adjacent regions of the Philippines and parts of Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, its natural distribution has become increasingly fragmented in recent decades.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adipe aureofulva was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been documented in several states including Oregon and Washington. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its introduction is believed to be due to accidental dispersal through human activities.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still under study.</p>
