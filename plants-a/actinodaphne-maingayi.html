<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne maingayi is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely confined to its native range, with limited cultivation outside of its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, lowland rainforests and prefers well-drained, fertile soils. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited research, its conservation status is currently listed as Data Deficient by the IUCN.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne maingayi is a tropical evergreen tree known for its ornamental value and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. The growth cycle of this plant is relatively slow, with steady growth under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining, fertile soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the tree are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with scale insects or fungal infections.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants can enhance its growth and health.</p>
