                <h1>Actinophloeus bleeseri</h1>
<p>Actinophloeus bleeseri, commonly known as the African starfish plant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that are typically green with a bluish or purplish tint. The plant produces striking star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is prized for its ornamental value and ability to add a dramatic visual impact to rock gardens or container displays.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus bleeseri has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 3 to 8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the late spring to early summer, relying on wind pollination due to their inconspicuous petals. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus bleeseri is primarily native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>This unique plant species is found in the dry deciduous forests of the eastern part of the island. It thrives in areas with well-drained soils and receives moderate to high levels of sunlight. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this plant from threats such as habitat loss and over-collection.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus bleeseri was mainly introduced to the eastern coastal regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the shoreline. The plant thrives in saline environments and is often seen in coastal dunes. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
