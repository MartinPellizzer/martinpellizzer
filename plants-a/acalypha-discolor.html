<p>Acalypha discolor, commonly known as the variegated spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its strikingly variegated leaves with green, white, and pink markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences called cyathia. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to bright light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Acalypha discolor is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha discolor has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes variegated underside.</p>
<p>Its stems are slender, herbaceous, and often branched, with a smooth, pale green to reddish-brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and they are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed schizocarp that splits into three winged segments, dispersing seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and allowing the plant to thrive in disturbed environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
