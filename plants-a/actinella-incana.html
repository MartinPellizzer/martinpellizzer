                <h1>Actinella incana</h1>
<p>Actinella incana, commonly known as the silverleaf honeysuckle, is a shrub native to North America.</p>
<p>It features small, opposite leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a red, fleshy drupe that ripens in late summer.</p>
<p>Actinella incana is often found in moist woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinella incana has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a pale green color and a rough, hairy texture on the upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a grayish-brown bark that is fissured and has a rough texture, growing in a creeping or ascending pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are white or pale yellow, with five petals and a tubular corolla, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella incana is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found throughout the country, particularly in the North and South Islands. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests, shrublands, and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with the lower and upper montane regions.</p>
<p>Actinella incana is an important component of New Zealand's native flora and is often found in association with other endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella incana was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the genus Actinella, which includes several species used in horticulture and ornamental gardening. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It is often found growing in coastal and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited compared to other introduced species, but it has established itself in specific ecological niches.</p>
