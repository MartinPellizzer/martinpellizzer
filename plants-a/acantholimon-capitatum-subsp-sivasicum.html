<p>Acantholimon capitatum subsp.</p>
<p>sivasicum, commonly known as the Sivasic mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and steppes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acantholimon capitatum subsp.</p>
<p>sivasicum belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and some green algae, characterized by their complex structures and ability to perform photosynthesis. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises vascular plants with a diverse range of forms, including ferns and some seed plants.</p>
<p>Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is distinguished by its complex floral structures. Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes plants with distinctive floral morphology and often show adaptations to arid environments. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, a family of flowering plants commonly known as the leadplant family, characterized by their often blue or purple flowers and medicinal properties. Its genus is Acantholimon, a group of flowering plants typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, known for their succulent leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon capitatum, a specific type within the genus, characterized by its erect growth, dense foliage, and unique floral features adapted to its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon capitatum subsp.</p>
<p>sivasicum is primarily native to Turkey. This subspecies is found in specific regions within Turkey, particularly in the eastern and southeastern areas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky and arid environments, often in mountainous regions. The plant is adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of these areas.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific habitats within Turkey.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon capitatum subsp.</p>
<p>sivasicum was mainly introduced to areas with rocky or gravelly soils in arid and semi-arid regions. It thrives in environments with low moisture and high sunlight exposure.</p>
<p>This subspecies is commonly found in mountainous areas and along rocky outcrops. It is often used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>However, its introduction can sometimes lead to competition with native plant species.</p>
