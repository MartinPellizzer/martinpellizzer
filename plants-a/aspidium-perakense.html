                    <h1>Aspidium perakense</h1>
<p>Aspidium perakense, commonly known as the Perak water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that helps it anchor in muddy or sandy substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Aspidium perakense plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling.</p>
