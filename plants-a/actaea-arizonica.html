                <h1>Actaea arizonica</h1>
<p>Actaea arizonica, commonly known as Arizona black cohosh, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that bear large, palmately compound leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its berries are dark red and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Actaea arizonica typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in woodlands and canyons.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea arizonica has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are doubly to triply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a single main stem. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers in an upright cluster, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry containing several seeds, which are dispersed by birds and mammals eating the berries.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea arizonica is primarily native to Arizona.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the desert and mountainous regions of the state. This plant thrives in rocky soils and can be seen in areas with partial shade. It is an important part of the local flora and contributes to the biodiversity of Arizona's ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often limited to certain geographic areas within the state.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea arizonica was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically in woodland or forested regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in the eastern United States. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly its distinctive, compound leaves and delicate, white flowers. It prefers cooler temperatures and can be sensitive to extreme heat or drought.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed outside of its native range.</p>
