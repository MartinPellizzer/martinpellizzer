                        <h1>Abutilon fraseri var. halophilum</h1>
<p>Abutilon fraseri var. halophilum, commonly known as the saltbush abutilon, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots and succulent stems enable it to store water, making it resilient in coastal and saline soils.</p>
<p>This species is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes, contributing to stabilizing these fragile ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon fraseri var. halophilum is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa.</p>
<p>This variant thrives in saline and coastal environments, often found in dune areas and along the Atlantic coast. It is adapted to withstand high salt levels and arid conditions, making it a characteristic plant of these ecosystems. The plant is commonly observed in sandy soils near the shoreline, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the unique environmental conditions of the Namibian and South African coasts.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon fraseri var. halophilum was mainly introduced to coastal and saline environments due to its tolerance of salt and arid conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high salinity, such as salt marshes and coastal dunes. This plant has been reported in several regions along the Pacific coast, including California and Oregon. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to invade native habitats.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes local vegetation.</p>
