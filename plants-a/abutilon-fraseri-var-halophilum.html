                        <h1>Abutilon fraseri var. halophilum</h1>
<p>Abutilon fraseri var. halophilum, commonly known as the saltbush abutilon, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots and succulent stems enable it to store water, making it resilient in coastal and saline soils.</p>
<p>This species is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes, contributing to stabilizing these fragile ecosystems.</p>
