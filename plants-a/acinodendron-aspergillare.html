                <h1>Acinodendron aspergillare</h1>
<p>Acinodendron aspergillare, commonly known as the rough-hair acinodendron, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems covered in rough, hairy texture. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a leathery texture and dark green color.</p>
<p>Acinodendron aspergillare is often found in moist, shaded habitats within forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron aspergillare has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a dark green color with a slightly rough upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the surface soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron aspergillare is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland forests where there is ample sunlight and well-drained soil. This plant is often found in secondary growth areas and along riverbanks, where it can take advantage of disturbed soils and increased moisture. Its distribution is closely linked to the region's warm climate and seasonal rainfall patterns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its natural range has become fragmented, leading to concerns about its conservation status.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron aspergillare was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and degraded habitats, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high sunlight exposure and moderate to high moisture levels. This plant is often found in disturbed landscapes such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and urban margins. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas make it a common invasive species in many regions.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact varies depending on the local flora and environmental conditions.</p>
