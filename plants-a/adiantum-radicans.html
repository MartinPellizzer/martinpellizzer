                <h1>Adiantum radicans</h1>
<p>Adiantum radicans, commonly known as the Maidenhair Fern, is a delicate and graceful fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, bright green fronds that resemble flowing hair, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies over time.</p>
<p>Adiantum radicans is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in shady garden areas or as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum radicans has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, typically ranging from 10 to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and creeping, often rooting at the nodes, and has a smooth, light green bark. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures rather than true flowers, and does not have showy flowers, blooming period, or pollination method. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and these are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant, facilitating its growth along the edges of ponds or streams.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum radicans is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along streams. This fern thrives in humid climates and is often seen growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its natural range extends from the southeastern United States up through the northeastern regions.</p>
<p>It is also occasionally found in the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum radicans was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and as a decorative plant in shaded garden environments.</p>
<p>It is valued for its delicate, fern-like foliage that adds a soft, lush appearance to indoor and outdoor spaces. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it ideal for woodland gardens or as a houseplant. Due to its attractive appearance, it has been widely cultivated in regions with temperate climates.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
