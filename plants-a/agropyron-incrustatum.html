                    <h1>Agropyron incrustatum</h1>
<p>Agropyron incrustatum, commonly known as the sandberg bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and forms dense, low-growing sods that are highly drought-tolerant. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive blue-gray sheen, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies, open woodlands, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
