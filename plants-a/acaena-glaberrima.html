                        <h1>Acaena glaberrima</h1>
<p>Acaena glaberrima, commonly known as the silky burr, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and persistent, spiny bracts. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by spherical, hairy fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin.</p>
<p>Acaena glaberrima is often found in coastal and subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena glaberrima is primarily native to South America, specifically Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries, particularly in the Andes mountain range. This plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on slopes and in open grasslands. It is well adapted to the climate of the southern cone of South America.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to these specific geographic areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena glaberrima was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the ornamental plant trade due to its attractive foliage and small flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various habitats. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in coastal and forested areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting management efforts to control its spread.</p>
