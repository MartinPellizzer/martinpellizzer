                    <h1>Anthobryum</h1>
<p>Anthobryum, commonly known as the common thyme moss, is a genus of mosses belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically small, carpet-like, and thrive in rocky or sandy soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Anthobryum species are characterized by their dense, cushion-like growth form and their ability to survive in harsh conditions due to their thick, waxy leaves. They play an important role in soil stabilization and as indicators of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, each with slight variations in morphology and habitat preference.</p>
