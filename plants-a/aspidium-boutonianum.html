                    <h1>Aspidium boutonianum</h1>
<p>Aspidium boutonianum, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features lance-shaped, deeply lobed fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hair. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium.</p>
