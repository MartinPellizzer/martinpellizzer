                            <h1>Aspalathus Kougaensis</h1>
<p>Kouga bush, scientifically known as Aspalathus kougaensis, is a unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. This small shrub is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and dense foliage, making it a striking addition to local ecosystems. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant plays a vital role in supporting local biodiversity and is also valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution, conservation efforts are essential to ensure its survival in the wild.</p>
