                    <h1>Alhagi camelorum var. turcorum</h1>
<p>Alhagi camelorum var. turcorum, commonly known as the Turkestan sandmat, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for sandy soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
