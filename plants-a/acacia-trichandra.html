<p>Acacia trichandra, commonly known as the black wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that are arranged in compact clusters, followed by long, slender pods containing dark, flat seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and a deep root system.</p>
<p>Acacia trichandra is also known for its historical use in the production of tannin-rich bark, which was once widely used in the tanning industry.</p>
