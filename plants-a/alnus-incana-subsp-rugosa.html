<p>Alnus incana subsp.</p>
<p>rugosa, commonly known as the rough alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves that are often reddish-brown underneath.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This species is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria, enriching the soil.</p>
