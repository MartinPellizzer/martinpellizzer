                    <h1>Agrostis vulgaris var. prorepens</h1>
<p>Agrostis vulgaris var. prorepens, commonly known as creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous and stolonal growth habits allow it to spread rapidly and form extensive colonies.</p>
<p>It is often used in turfgrass applications due to its durability and ability to recover from wear.</p>
