                <h1>Actinodaphne bourdillonii</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne bourdillonii, commonly known as the Khasi nut or Indian frankincense, is a small evergreen tree native to the northeastern regions of India and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed, and its bark is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and medicinal contexts within its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne bourdillonii has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stems are smooth and cylindrical, with a light brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and they grow in a straight, upright pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in panicles, blooming during the rainy season, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, three-lobed drupe that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne bourdillonii is primarily native to India.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of the country, particularly in the states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded areas within dense forests. It is commonly associated with evergreen and semi-evergreen forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within India's diverse flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne bourdillonii was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where its ornamental value and adaptability make it suitable for cultivation.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and as an ornamental plant in areas with warm, humid climates. The distribution includes parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of the Americas. Its introduction is largely due to horticultural interest and its ability to thrive in shaded to semi-shaded environments.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is cultivated.</p>
