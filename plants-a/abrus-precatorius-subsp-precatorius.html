<p>Abrus precatorius subsp.</p>
<p>precatorius, commonly known as the velvet bean or jequirity, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its striking red and black seed pods, which contain flat, bean-shaped seeds covered in a silky, velvety coating.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has compound leaves with three to five leaflets. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste lands.</p>
<p>The seeds are toxic due to the presence of abrin, a potent lectin that can be lethal in high doses.</p>
