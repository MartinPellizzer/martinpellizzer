                    <h1>Aerobion carinatum</h1>
<p>Aerobion carinatum, commonly known as the spiked bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are covered in tiny, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving water, where it can absorb nutrients from both water and captured organisms. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow and are borne on slender stems that rise from the water's surface.</p>
<p>Aerobion carinatum plays a unique role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling small invertebrate populations and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
