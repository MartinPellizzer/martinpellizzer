                    <h1>Aspidium conterminum var. resiniferum</h1>
<p>Aspidium conterminum var. resiniferum, commonly known as the resinous wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is a fern characterized by its distinctive, pinnately divided fronds that often have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to produce a resinous substance, which may contribute to its unique ecological role and chemical composition.</p>
