                <h1>Acrospelion bertolonii</h1>
<p>Acrospelion bertolonii, commonly known as the Bertoloni's rock cress, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered leaves adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers with four petals, typical of the Brassicaceae family. It thrives in rocky substrates and is often found in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrospelion bertolonii has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant grows. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
