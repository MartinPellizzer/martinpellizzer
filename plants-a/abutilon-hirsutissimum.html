                        <h1>Abutilon hirsutissimum</h1>
<p>Abutilon hirsutissimum, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a shrub native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its velvety, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive texture. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in some regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon hirsutissimum is primarily native to South America, specifically countries such as Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open habitats like grasslands, savannas, and along riverbanks. It is also known to grow in disturbed areas and is often found in secondary forests.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into parts of Central America as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon hirsutissimum was mainly introduced to control erosion and for ornamental purposes in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in agricultural areas. The plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative means contribute to its invasive potential.</p>
<p>However, it is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and tolerance to poor soil conditions.</p>
