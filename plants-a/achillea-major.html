                <h1>Achillea major</h1>
<p>Achillea major, commonly known as yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads that range from white to pink or red. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. It produces a strong, aromatic scent and is known for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Achillea major is also valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea major has compound, feather-like leaves that are gray-green in color, arranged alternately along the stem, and have a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark, growing in a bushy, branching pattern. Its flowers are flat-topped umbels composed of small, white to pale yellow ray florets, blooming from early summer to late summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, two-lobed achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea major is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is now widely distributed across temperate regions, including North America and parts of Australia, where it has been introduced as an ornamental or weed. This plant thrives in open, sunny environments such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It typically grows at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to about 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>While it is not currently listed as threatened, its invasive potential in non-native regions raises concerns for local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea major is a hardy perennial plant known for its fern-like foliage and bright yellow or white flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rootstock in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. The plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its health and shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
