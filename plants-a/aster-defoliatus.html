<p>It is characterized by its absence of leaves, with only flowering stems that bear small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its flowering period occurs in the summer months, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology, it is often confused with other aster species but can be distinguished by its lack of foliage.</p>
