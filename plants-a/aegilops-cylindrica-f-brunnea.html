<p>Aegilops cylindrica f. brunnea, commonly known as the black rye or black wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black颖 (lemmas) that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm and produces spikelets that are arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration.</p>
<p>This species is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature.</p>
