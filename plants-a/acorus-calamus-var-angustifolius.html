                <h1>Acorus calamus var. angustifolius</h1>
<p>Acorus calamus var. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved sweet flag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped, often emerging from water or moist soil. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow water or damp environments, making it a common sight in wetlands and ponds.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, contributing to aquatic ecosystem stability.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. angustifolius has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, arranged in a fan shape at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed, three-seeded capsule that disperses its seeds by water or wind.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming a dense network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. angustifolius is a variant of the sweet flag plant native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is now also found in various regions of the United States, particularly in the eastern and central states, where it has been introduced. This plant thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams, preferring shallow water or moist soil. It typically grows at low altitudes, often below 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>While it is not currently listed as endangered, its introduction to non-native areas has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. angustifolius is a hardy, ornamental plant commonly grown in wetlands and bog gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through rhizome division or by sowing seeds in early spring. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within one growing season.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil and requires consistent watering to maintain its lush foliage. Fertilization with a balanced aquatic fertilizer in spring and pruning of dead leaves in autumn helps maintain its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract slugs or snails in damp conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with water lilies or rushes can enhance its aesthetic appeal in water features.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. angustifolius is a wetland plant that provides food and shelter for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a natural filtration system, improving water quality in wetland ecosystems. It also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Additionally, it serves as a companion plant for other wetland species, enhancing biodiversity and ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus var. angustifolius is a versatile plant with a range of uses across various domains.</p>
<p>In culinary applications, its rhizomes have been used to flavor foods and beverages, particularly in traditional cuisines.
