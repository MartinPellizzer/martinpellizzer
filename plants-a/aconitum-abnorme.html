                <h1>Aconitum abnorme</h1>
<p>Aconitum abnorme, commonly known as the Himalayan monkshood, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, hood-shaped flowers that are typically purple or blue in color. The plant belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its toxic alkaloids, which make it highly poisonous to both animals and humans. Aconitum abnorme thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and potent chemical composition make it a notable species in both botanical studies and traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum abnorme has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and has a bluish-green color, growing to a height of up to 2 meters. Its flowers are showy and blue-violet in color, arranged in racemes, with a complex structure featuring sepals and petals, blooming in late summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases small, dark brown seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, anchoring the plant and storing nutrients.</p>
