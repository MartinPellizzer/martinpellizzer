                    <h1>Agave × massiliensis</h1>
<p>Agave × massiliensis, commonly known as the Massiliensis agave, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Agave americana and Agave inulifolia.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly France, where it thrives in coastal environments. This species is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick, fleshy, and often covered in a whitish bloom. The leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, white flowers, which are usually pollinated by insects.</p>
