                <h1>Avicennia marina</h1>
<p>Avicennia marina, commonly known as the mangrove shrub, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which allow it to absorb oxygen from the waterlogged soil. The plant thrives in coastal areas, such as estuaries and tidal flats, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines. Its leaves are small, thick, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss and salt intake.</p>
<p>Avicennia marina is also capable of excreting excess salt through its leaves, making it highly resilient to saltwater conditions.</p>
