                <h1>Adinandra calosericea</h1>
<p>Adinandra calosericea, commonly known as the silky-haired adinandra, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with four to five petals, and it produces small, red berries that are edible.</p>
<p>Adinandra calosericea is often found in moist, shaded areas within tropical forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra calosericea has elliptical to ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale grey bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that splits open to release smooth, black seeds, which are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra calosericea is primarily native to the western and central regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, and the Central African Republic. This plant typically grows in tropical rainforests and moist lowland areas. It is commonly found in secondary forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the humid and warm climate conditions of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra calosericea was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental species due to its attractive foliage and unique floral structure. It has been introduced to several island nations in the Pacific and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited due to its specific ecological requirements and susceptibility to environmental stressors.</p>
