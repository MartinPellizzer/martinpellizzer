                    <h1>Alnus februaria var. pinnatifida</h1>
<p>Alnus februaria var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the slender alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely pinnately lobed leaves, which give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
