<p>Adiantum speciosum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace, which are typically dark green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Adiantum speciosum is a popular ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care in indoor settings.</p>
