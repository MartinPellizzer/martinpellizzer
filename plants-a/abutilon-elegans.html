                        <h1>Abutilon elegans</h1>
<p>Abutilon elegans, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon elegans is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in open woodlands, savannas, and along riverbanks. This plant is well adapted to moist environments and is commonly found in areas with rich, well-drained soils. It is also known to occur in parts of Central America, including Guatemala and Honduras.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon elegans was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers and fuzzy leaves. This species has since become naturalized in moist, disturbed areas such as stream banks and forest edges. It is considered a non-native invasive species in some parts of its range, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a challenging plant to control.</p>
