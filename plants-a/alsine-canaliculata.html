                    <h1>Alsine canaliculata</h1>
<p>Alsine canaliculata, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed sandwort, is a low-growing annual plant native to sandy and coastal habitats in the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Alsine canaliculata plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for early-season pollinators.</p>
