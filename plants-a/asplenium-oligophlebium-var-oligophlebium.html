<p>Asplenium oligophlebium var. oligophlebium, commonly known as the narrow-veined spleenwort, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with closely spaced, narrow veins that give it its common name. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance in botanical gardens.</p>
