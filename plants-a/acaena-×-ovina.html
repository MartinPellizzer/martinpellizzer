                        <h1>Acaena × ovina</h1>
<p>Acaena × ovina, commonly known as New Zealand spinach, is a hybrid plant originating from the cross between Acaena crassipes and Acaena hastata.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub characterized by its dense, prickly foliage and bright yellow flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acaena × ovina belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises vascular plants with a diverse range of forms, including ferns and flowering plants. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species.</p>
<p>Its order is Rosales, a group of flowering plants that includes roses, strawberries, and other economically significant plants. Its family is Rosaceae, commonly known as the rose family, which includes a wide variety of plants with showy flowers and fruits. Its genus is Acaena, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "Burr bushes" or "Cotoneaster," characterized by their spiny fruits.</p>

<p>Acaena × ovina was mainly introduced to New Zealand North and New Zealand South.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Acaena novae-zelandiae and Acaena hastata. This species has been widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various habitats across both regions.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
