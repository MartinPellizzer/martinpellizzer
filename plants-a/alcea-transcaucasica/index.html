                            <h1>Alcea Transcaucasica</h1>
<p>Alcea transcaucasica is a striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Transcaucasus. It is known for its tall, slender stems and large, showy blooms that range from pink to red in color. This species thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its unique appearance and hardy nature have made it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike. Despite its beauty, it remains relatively underappreciated compared to more commonly cultivated members of the hibiscus family.</p>
