                    <h1>Astragalus pelecinus</h1>
<p>Astragalus pelecinus, commonly known as the pelecinus milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive, leathery pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Astragalus pelecinus has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions and plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
