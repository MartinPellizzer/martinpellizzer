<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces dark, glossy berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its wood is valued for its fragrance and durability, making it an important species in local economies.</p>
<p>The tree thrives in humid, shaded environments and plays a role in forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne campanulata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exhibits a somewhat rough texture. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the rainy season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne campanulata is a tropical evergreen tree native to the island of Borneo, specifically found in the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations within lowland rainforests. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. The species typically grows at altitudes between 200 and 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, Actinodaphne campanulata is considered critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne campanulata is a tropical evergreen shrub known for its fragrant, bell-shaped leaves and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in warm, humid conditions with indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, requiring regular watering without becoming waterlogged. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants like hibiscus or ferns can enhance its growth and aesthetic appeal.</p>
