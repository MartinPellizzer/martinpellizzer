                <h1>Aegiphila trinitensis</h1>
<p>Aegiphila trinitensis, commonly known as the Trinidadian ironwood, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Trinidad and Tobago.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests. The plant features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive grayish-green color and a rough texture. Its flowers are small, clustered, and usually pale yellow or greenish-white, blooming in spring.</p>
<p>Aegiphila trinitensis is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila trinitensis has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, woody, and has a rough, fissured bark that is gray to brown in color, growing in a shrub-like form. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white or pale pink petals, and bloom during the dry season, likely pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
