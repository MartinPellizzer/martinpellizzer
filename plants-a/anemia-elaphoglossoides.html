                    <h1>Anemia elaphoglossoides</h1>
<p>Anemia elaphoglossoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a small, aquatic fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Anemia elaphoglossoides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
