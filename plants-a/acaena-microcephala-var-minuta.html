<p>Acaena microcephala var. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf New Zealand bramble, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features small, spiny stems and produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant's fruit is a hard, dark brown achene, often covered in hooked bracts that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its dense growth, it can form thickets that provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>
