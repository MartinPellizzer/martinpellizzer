                <h1>Acrostichum glabellum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum glabellum, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with thick, creeping stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small, rounded pinnae that give it a lush, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Acrostichum glabellum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum glabellum has leaves that are typically elongated, narrow, and sword-shaped, arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a glossy green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows in a creeping or clumping habit. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum glabellum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid environments, often found in lowland rainforests and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with swampy or wetland habitats where it can tolerate standing water. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends across the Indo-Australian Archipelago, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum glabellum was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in coastal areas of Florida and the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, ditches, and wetlands. This plant is often mistaken for native species due to its similar appearance. It has been reported in several states including Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.</p>
<p>Its introduction is believed to be due to human activity, such as accidental transport through soil or vegetation.</p>
