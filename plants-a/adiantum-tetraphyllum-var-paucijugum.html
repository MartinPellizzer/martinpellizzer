                    <h1>Adiantum tetraphyllum var. paucijugum</h1>
<p>Adiantum tetraphyllum var. paucijugum, commonly known as the lesser horse fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its reduced number of pinnae compared to the typical form of Adiantum tetraphyllum.</p>
