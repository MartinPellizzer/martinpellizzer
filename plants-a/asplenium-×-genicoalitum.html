                    <h1>Asplenium × genicoalitum</h1>
<p>Asplenium × genicoalitum, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between *Asplenium trichomanes* and *Asplenium bulbiferum*.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
