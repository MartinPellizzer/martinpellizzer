                <h1>Actinodaphne wightiana</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and rough, fissured bark. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by dark blue-black berries. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a leathery texture and a fragrant scent when crushed.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its timber and is also used in traditional medicine for its therapeutic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne wightiana has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, pale grey bark that exudes a fragrant resin when cut. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming between April and June, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns from green to yellowish-brown when mature, dispersing its seeds by birds and wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in nutrient absorption and soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne wightiana is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indian subcontinent, particularly found in India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Southeast Asia, including Bangladesh and Myanmar, though it is less common outside its original range. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in lowland and hill forests, typically growing in humid and warm climates. This species is usually found at altitudes between 300 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Actinodaphne wightiana is considered to be of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne wightiana is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree known for its aromatic foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and thrives in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season supports healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and promote air circulation. Common pests include scale insects and mealybugs, while root rot and leaf spot diseases can occur if conditions are not properly managed.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving herbs or flowering plants can enhance its aesthetic appeal and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne wightiana is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds, contributing to the health of the local ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other native flora to enhance biodiversity. Its dense foliage helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil on slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance by supporting a wide range of fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne wightiana is a versatile plant with significant uses across various domains.</p>
