                <h1>Actinodaphne wightiana</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne wightiana, commonly known as Wight's camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, rough-textured bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. It is valued for its essential oils, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of camphor.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its ecological importance in forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne wightiana has elliptical, dark green leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a smooth texture and a moderate size, typically measuring around 10-15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small to medium-sized tree. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through both animal consumption and wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in nutrient absorption and soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne wightiana is primarily native to India.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern and eastern regions of the country, including the Western Ghats and the northeastern states. This plant typically grows in moist, tropical and subtropical forests. It is commonly seen in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Actinodaphne wightiana is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne wightiana was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in various parts of Southeast Asia, including India, Malaysia, and Indonesia, where it thrives in humid climates. The plant is often found in gardens and as a landscape plant because of its aesthetic value and ease of care. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impact in regions where it is not native.</p>
