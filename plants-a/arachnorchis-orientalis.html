                    <h1>Arachnorchis orientalis</h1>
<p>Arachnorchis orientalis, commonly known as the oriental spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a single, erect spike bearing several pale green to yellowish flowers with intricate patterns resembling spider webs. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
