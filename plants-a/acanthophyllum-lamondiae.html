                    <h1>Acanthophyllum lamondiae</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum lamondiae, commonly known as the Lamond's spiny bush, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with small leaves that reduce water loss and deep roots that access underground moisture. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
