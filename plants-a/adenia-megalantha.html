                <h1>Adenia megalantha</h1>
<p>Adenia megalantha, commonly known as the giant adenia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its woody, climbing structure. The plant produces large, showy flowers with five sepals and five petals, often in shades of yellow and red. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>Adenia megalantha is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia megalantha has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown to reddish in color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are large, showy, and zygomorphic, with a deep purple to violet color, blooming during the wet season and pollinated primarily by birds. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia megalantha is primarily native to eastern Australia, specifically found in the states of Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly associated with rainforest and moist woodland habitats. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often found in the understorey of subtropical and temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within these states, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia megalantha was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates where it can thrive in humid, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Queensland. This plant is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses due to its ornamental value and ability to adapt to various growing conditions. It prefers full sun to partial shade and requires regular watering during its growing season.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is important to manage its spread to prevent it from becoming invasive in local ecosystems.</p>
