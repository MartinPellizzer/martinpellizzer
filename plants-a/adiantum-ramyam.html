                <h1>Adiantum ramyam</h1>
<p>Adiantum ramyam, commonly known as the Indian maidenhair fern, is a species native to the wet tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the feathers of a bird, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, displaying a striking blue-green hue under certain light conditions.</p>
<p>Adiantum ramyam is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its traditional use in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum ramyam has fern-like leaves that are pinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring around 20-30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a slightly glossy texture. The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, light green bark that grows in a single, branching pattern.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-yellow in color, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, round capsule that releases spores, and the plant relies on spore dispersal rather than seeds for reproduction.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and anchor the plant to moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum ramyam is primarily native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. It is often seen growing along stream banks and in dense undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within the Western Ghats, where the climate and soil conditions are suitable for its growth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum ramyam was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive fronds and adaptability.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and greenhouses where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant prefers well-drained soil and moderate temperatures, making it suitable for a variety of climates. Its introduction has led to its cultivation in many parts of the world, including Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of the United States.</p>
<p>However, it is not typically invasive in its introduced range, as it requires specific growing conditions to flourish.</p>
