                <h1>Acinodendron durum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron durum, commonly known as the African sand verbena, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its hairy, square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Acinodendron durum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron durum has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub with a dense, upright growth habit. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, providing stability and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron durum is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. This plant thrives in coastal and mountainous regions with a Mediterranean climate. It is commonly found in rocky soils and open vegetation types.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific areas within the country.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron durum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including land clearing and agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
