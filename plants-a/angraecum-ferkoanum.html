                    <h1>Angraecum ferkoanum</h1>
<p>Angraecum ferkoanum, commonly known as the Ferkoanum orchid, is a rare and enigmatic species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. Its unique floral structure suggests a specialized relationship with nocturnal moths, a common trait among Angraecum species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
