                    <h1>Azolla mexicana</h1>
<p>Azolla mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican water clover, is a small, aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It forms dense floating mats on the surface of ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, which enhances its ability to absorb nutrients. Its rapid growth rate makes it an effective bioindicator of water quality and a potential tool for phytoremediation.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically dark green and consist of tiny, overlapping leaves that provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
