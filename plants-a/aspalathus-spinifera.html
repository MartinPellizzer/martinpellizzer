                    <h1>Aspalathus spinifera</h1>
<p>Aspalathus spinifera, commonly known as the African red bush, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody stems covered in small, stiff spines, which provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, red, spherical fruits. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Aspalathus spinifera is often found in rocky, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
