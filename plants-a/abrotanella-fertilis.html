<p>Abrotanella fertilis, commonly known as the goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in the spring, and the plant produces small, hairy fruits that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>Abrotanella fertilis is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
