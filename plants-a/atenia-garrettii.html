                    <h1>Atenia garrettii</h1>
<p>Atenia garrettii, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a compact, spiny stem that branches into short, fleshy segments. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Atenia garrettii is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
