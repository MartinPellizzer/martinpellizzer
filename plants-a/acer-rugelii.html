                <h1>Acer rugelii</h1>
<p>Acer rugelii, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 meters, with a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its showy flowers and colorful foliage, which make it a favored species in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer rugelii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface that turns red in autumn; they are alternate in arrangement and typically measure 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery strips. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree, pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer rugelii is a deciduous tree native to eastern China, specifically found in the provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangxi.</p>
<p>Although it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to fragmented populations in these regions. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to semi-shaded environments within temperate forests. Acer rugelii typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer rugelii is a deciduous tree known for its striking red foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of Acer rugelii includes a period of rapid growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture levels, requiring regular watering during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues like aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer rugelii is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil health and supporting a diverse range of flora and fauna. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape in areas prone to degradation.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer rugelii offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing habitat for insects and other organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer rugelii is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value, often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential nutritional benefits. In traditional medicine, some parts of the plant may have been used for their purported health properties, though scientific validation remains limited. Industrially, it contributes to the forestry sector by providing timber and wood for various crafts.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions, representing resilience and seasonal change.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer rugelii has several popular cultivars that are highly valued in horticulture, such as 'Variegatum' and 'Atrosanguineum', known for their striking foliage colors and unique leaf patterns.</p>
<p>It is also a parent species in the creation of numerous hybrids, including the popular 'Autumn Flame' and 'Crimson King', which combine the ornamental traits of Acer rugelii with those of other maple species. These hybrids often exhibit enhanced cold hardiness and more vibrant fall coloration, making them desirable for landscaping. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its ability to contribute to the genetic diversity of ornamental maples.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids are widely cultivated for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden environments.</p>
