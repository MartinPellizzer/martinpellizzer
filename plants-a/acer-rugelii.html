                <h1>Acer rugelii</h1>
<p>Acer rugelii, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow in autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 10–20 feet and has a rounded, compact form. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>Acer rugelii thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular ornamental tree in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer rugelii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, turning yellow in autumn. The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a deciduous tree with a rounded crown. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer rugelii is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Hubei.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed in the wild within these regions, though it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and arboreta around the world. This species thrives in temperate climates with moist, well-drained soils, typically found in forested areas. Acer rugelii grows at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer rugelii is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, which require stratification, or through semi-hardwood cuttings taken in summer. The growth cycle of Acer rugelii involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy during winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with plants like lavender or conifers can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer rugelii is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing soil stability and promoting diverse plant growth. Its root system helps with erosion control by binding soil together, preventing runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer rugelii offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and supporting a wide range of ecosystem interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer rugelii is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value, often cultivated in gardens and parks for its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas. In medicinal contexts, it has been explored for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, it contributes to the timber and paper industries in some regions.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty in various East Asian traditions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer rugelii has several popular cultivars, including 'Katsura', 'Crimson King', and 'Variegatum', which are prized for their unique leaf coloration and ornamental value.</p>
<p>These cultivars often exhibit striking autumn colors or variegated foliage, making them popular choices in gardens and landscapes. Hybrid varieties of Acer rugelii have also been developed to enhance traits such as disease resistance and cold hardiness. Horticulturally, these plants are valued for their adaptability to various climates and their ability to add visual interest throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>Their aesthetic appeal and resilience contribute to their significance in both public and private horticultural settings.</p>
