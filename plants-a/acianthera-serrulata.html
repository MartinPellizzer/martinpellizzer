<p>Acianthera serrulata, commonly known as the serrated acianthera, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, linear leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera serrulata has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with serrated margins. The stem is slender, slightly woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age.

<p>It is commonly found in the humid tropical and subtropical regions of this area. This orchid typically grows in forested habitats, including both primary and secondary vegetation. It thrives in areas with high rainfall and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its delicate flowers and is often found in shaded undergrowth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera serrulata was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments such as tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil, often found near streams or in the undergrowth of dense vegetation. This plant is commonly introduced in horticultural settings due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. It has been reported in several countries in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native habitats.</p>
