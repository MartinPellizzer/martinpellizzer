<p>Asplenium aequabile, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a small evergreen fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a compact, upright growth habit with fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into lance-shaped, serrated leaves. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Asplenium aequabile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
