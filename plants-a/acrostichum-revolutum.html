                <h1>Acrostichum revolutum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum revolutum, commonly known as the broadleaf hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests.</p>
<p>Acrostichum revolutum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warm climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum revolutum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are elongated and have a wavy, revolute margin, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are alternate in arrangement and can reach up to 2 meters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that has a fibrous texture, and it grows in a clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed, dry capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after ripening in late summer.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor itself and spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum revolutum is primarily native to the tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland areas, including rainforests and moist coastal regions. This plant thrives in warm, shaded environments with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often associated with riverbanks and swampy areas where it can access abundant water.</p>
<p>Its native distribution includes countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and parts of the Caribbean.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum revolutum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive fronds and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has been introduced to several countries in the Americas, including the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. Its introduction has led to its establishment in natural habitats, sometimes becoming invasive in certain areas.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, careful management is necessary to prevent its spread into native ecosystems.</p>
