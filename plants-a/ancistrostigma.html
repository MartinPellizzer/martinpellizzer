                    <h1>Ancistrostigma</h1>
<p>Ancistrostigma, commonly known as the "scentless orchid," is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often lack a strong fragrance. The plants typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, thriving on trees or rocks in humid environments. Ancistrostigma species have lance-shaped leaves and produce intricate, often showy inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to their rarity and specific habitat requirements, they are of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
