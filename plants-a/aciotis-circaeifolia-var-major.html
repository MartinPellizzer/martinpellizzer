                <h1>Aciotis circaeifolia var. major</h1>
<p>Aciotis circaeifolia var. major, commonly known as the Mexican daisy, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with lance-shaped leaves and yellow disc flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant blooms and compact growth habit.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis circaeifolia var. major has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a rough, bark-like texture, and exhibits a woody growth pattern that becomes more pronounced with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals and a tubular structure, blooming from spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, aiding in water absorption and anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis circaeifolia var. major is a rare plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries like South Africa and Lesotho.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to specific areas within its native range, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It is typically found in open grasslands and rocky outcrops at altitudes between 1,500 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aciotis circaeifolia var. major is a hardy, fast-growing plant commonly used in ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. The growth cycle of this plant is typically seasonal, with active growth during spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and encourage new shoots. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while diseases like powdery mildew may occur in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
