                <h1>Acridocarpus galphimiifolius</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus galphimiifolius, commonly known as the Malabar tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, sour fruits resembling small olives. Its botanical features make it valuable in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dye.</p>
<p>The tree is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in agroforestry systems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus galphimiifolius has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 10 to 20 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, often pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white to pale yellow petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus galphimiifolius is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found near human settlements.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into parts of the Indian subcontinent as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus galphimiifolius was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal and lowland environments where it can receive ample sunlight and moderate rainfall. This plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including accidental transport through trade and travel.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some areas, posing a challenge to native ecosystems.</p>
