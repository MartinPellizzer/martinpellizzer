                <h1>Acianthera exdrasii</h1>
<p>Acianthera exdrasii, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers and is often found in humid, tropical environments. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the rainforest canopy. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Acianthera exdrasii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera exdrasii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and slightly woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with a white to pale pink color, and feature three petals and three sepals, blooming during the summer months; they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera exdrasii is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the southeastern region of Brazil, particularly in the states of SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. It thrives in tropical and subtropical forest environments, often growing on trees or rocks. The plant is adapted to the humid and warm climate of this region.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within the southeastern Brazilian rainforests.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera exdrasii was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments, often growing in the understorey of forests or along stream banks. This plant is commonly found in regions of South America, particularly in Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. Its introduction has been primarily through horticultural trade and accidental dispersal by humans.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections worldwide.</p>
