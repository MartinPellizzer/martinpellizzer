<p>Aulonemia goyazensis, commonly known as the Goyazensis fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a short, creeping rhizome and finely divided, bipinnate leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in slow-moving or still waters with soft, acidic substrates, making it a popular choice for aquatic gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
