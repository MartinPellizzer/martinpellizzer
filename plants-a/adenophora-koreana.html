                <h1>Adenophora koreana</h1>
<p>Adenophora koreana, commonly known as Korean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and has lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Adenophora koreana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora koreana has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green color and slightly hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>Its stem is upright, cylindrical, and smooth, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. The flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in umbels, and are typically pale blue to purple in color, blooming from July to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora koreana is a flowering plant native to the Korean Peninsula, including both North and South Korea.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed in mountainous regions of Korea, particularly in the southern part of the country. This species thrives in temperate climates, often growing in forested areas and rocky slopes. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Adenophora koreana is listed as a vulnerable species due to habitat loss and over-collection, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenophora koreana is a perennial flowering plant native to Korea, known for its delicate blue flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. The growth cycle involves a dormant phase in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with partial shade and requires regular watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune dead foliage after flowering to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
