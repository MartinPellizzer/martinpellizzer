                <h1>Actinocephalus rigidus</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus rigidus, commonly known as the rigid actinocephalus, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus rigidus has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are upright and somewhat woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown to grey in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that releases seeds through mechanical means when it dries and splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus rigidus is primarily native to southern Australia, specifically the states of South Australia and Victoria.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal regions and sandy soils along the southern coastline. This plant thrives in dune environments and is often seen in areas with salt spray exposure. It is a hardy species adapted to the harsh conditions of the Australian coast.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific ecological zones within the southern parts of the country.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus rigidus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and on sand dunes. This plant is known for its ability to stabilize sand and prevent erosion. It has become a widespread species in the region.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its rapid growth and spread.</p>
