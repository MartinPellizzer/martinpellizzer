                    <h1>Astragalus commixtus var. abbreviatus</h1>
<p>Astragalus commixtus var. abbreviatus, commonly known as the short-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short stems and small, palmately divided leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinators.</p>
