                <h1>Aechmea vasquezii</h1>
<p>Aechmea vasquezii, commonly known as the VÃ¡squez bromeliad, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the cloud forests of Ecuador and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant flowers that range from red to orange in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Aechmea vasquezii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to indoor conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea vasquezii has rosette-shaped leaves that are narrow, strap-like, and arranged in a compact spiral, with a dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a prominent stem and bark, instead having a basal rosette that forms a cup-like structure to collect water. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of white to light blue flowers with prominent bracts, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that disperses seeds through wind and animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for water absorption, supporting the plant's epiphytic growth habit.</p>
