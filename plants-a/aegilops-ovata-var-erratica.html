<p>Aegilops ovata var. erratica, commonly known as the wandering wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
