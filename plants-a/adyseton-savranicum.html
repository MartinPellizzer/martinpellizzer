<p>Adyseton savranicum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dark reddish-brown bark. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich color, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts.</p>
