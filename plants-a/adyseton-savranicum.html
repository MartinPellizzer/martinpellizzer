                <h1>Adyseton savranicum</h1>
<p>Adyseton savranicum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dark reddish-brown bark. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich color, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adyseton savranicum has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size, typically up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and slightly woody, with a grayish-brown bark that is smooth when young and becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
