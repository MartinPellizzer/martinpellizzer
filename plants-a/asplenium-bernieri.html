<p>Asplenium bernieri, commonly known as the fern moss or rock fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Asplenium bernieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>
