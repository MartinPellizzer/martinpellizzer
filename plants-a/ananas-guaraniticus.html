                    <h1>Ananas guaraniticus</h1>
<p>Ananas guaraniticus, commonly known as the Guaran√≠ pineapple, is a bromeliad native to the Amazon rainforest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiky rosette of dark green, waxy leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces a fragrant, yellow-orange fruit with a sweet and tangy flavor, similar to the common pineapple. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and flavor, it is occasionally cultivated for ornamental and culinary purposes.</p>
