                        <h1>Acanthium onopordon</h1>
<p>Acanthium onopordon, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features gray-green, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in composite heads. It is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a hardy species in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Sandmat is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthium onopordon is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and dry grasslands. This plant is commonly associated with regions such as Spain, Italy, Morocco, and Turkey. It is well adapted to withstand drought conditions and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into the Middle East and parts of the Caucasus.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthium onopordon was mainly introduced to areas where its hardy nature and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it a potential invasive species.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates, often along roadsides, abandoned fields, and other disturbed habitats. The plant's rapid growth and competitive ability can lead to the displacement of native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to alter local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on native flora.</p>
