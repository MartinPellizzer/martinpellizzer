                <h1>Acronychia wisseliana</h1>
<p>Acronychia wisseliana, commonly known as the Wissel Island holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. The plant is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and dull underneath. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by spherical, woody fruits.</p>
<p>Acronychia wisseliana is often found growing in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia wisseliana has compound leaves that are alternate, with ovate to elliptical leaflets, dark green on top and pale underneath, and arranged in a pinnate pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin strips. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in axillary inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia wisseliana is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the island, particularly in the northern and eastern parts. This plant typically grows in lowland and montane rainforests. It is often associated with humid and shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within New Guinea.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia wisseliana was mainly introduced to urban and coastal areas for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped settings where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. The plant is known for its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate salt spray, making it suitable for seaside environments. It has been cultivated in several tropical and subtropical regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
