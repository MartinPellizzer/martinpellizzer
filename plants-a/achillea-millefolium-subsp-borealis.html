                <h1>Achillea millefolium subsp. borealis</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium subsp.</p>
<p>borealis, commonly known as Arctic yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with silver-gray, feathery leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold climates. It is often found in tundra and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
<p>Its aromatic foliage and resilience make it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium subsp.</p>
<p>borealis has lanceolate to linear leaves that are finely divided, giving them a feathery appearance, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface. The stems are slender, upright, and somewhat woody at the base, with a greyish-brown bark and a growth pattern that is typically clump-forming.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, clustered in flat-topped umbels, and bloom from June to August, primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in open, sunny habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium subsp.</p>
<p>borealis is a subspecies of yarrow that is native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. Its current distribution includes parts of Canada, Greenland, and northern Europe.</p>
<p>It thrives in open, sunny environments such as tundra, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. This subspecies typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to above 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>It is generally considered to be of least concern for conservation status due to its wide distribution and ability to colonize various habitats.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium subsp.</p>
<p>borealis is a hardy perennial plant known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and bright yellow flowers. It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of balanced fertilizer in spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
