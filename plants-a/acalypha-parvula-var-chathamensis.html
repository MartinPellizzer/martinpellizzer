<p>Acalypha parvula var. chathamensis, commonly known as the Chatham Island false nettle, is a small shrub native to the Chatham Islands of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually smooth or slightly hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by three-lobed, papery bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in coastal habitats and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
