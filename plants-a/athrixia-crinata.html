<p>Athrixia crinata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or crinata fern, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and distinctive, finely divided fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along streams. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Athrixia crinata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
