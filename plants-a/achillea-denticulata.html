                <h1>Achillea denticulata</h1>
<p>Achillea denticulata, commonly known as narrow-leaved yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely toothed leaves and flat-topped clusters of small white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. It is often found in meadows and along roadsides, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these habitats.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its medicinal properties, with historical uses in treating wounds and digestive ailments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea denticulata has leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a serrated or toothed margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and somewhat woody at the base, with a grayish-green color and a rough texture. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal, and the seeds are lightweight and easily carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea denticulata is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>While its native range is primarily in the Mediterranean, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including the United States and Australia. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in open habitats such as grasslands, slopes, and wastelands. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Achillea denticulata is not considered endangered, but its conservation status can vary depending on local habitat conditions and human activity.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea denticulata is a hardy perennial known for its fern-like foliage and bright yellow flowers, commonly grown in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rhizomes or by sowing seeds in early spring. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with new growth emerging in early spring and blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding overwatering to prevent root rot. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
