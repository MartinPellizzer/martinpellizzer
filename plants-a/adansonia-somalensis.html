                <h1>Adansonia somalensis</h1>
<p>Adansonia somalensis, commonly known as the Somali baobab, is a tree native to the arid regions of Somalia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Adansonia genus, which includes all baobab species, and is characterized by its massive, bottle-shaped trunk and thick, fibrous bark. The tree is well adapted to dry climates, storing water in its trunk and having deep root systems to access underground moisture. Its leaves are palmate, consisting of several lobes, and it produces large, white flowers that bloom during the rainy season.</p>
<p>The fruit is a hairy, woody capsule that contains edible seeds and pulp, which have been used for food and traditional medicine by local communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adansonia somalensis has thick, woody stems with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grayish-brown in color.</p>
<p>Its leaves are large, broad, and palmate, arranged in a rosette pattern, and are usually a deep green color. The flowers are large, showy, and consist of a central spadix surrounded by a crown of white or pale yellow bracts, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the plant to anchor itself and access water in its arid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adansonia somalensis is primarily native to the Horn of Africa, specifically Somalia and southern Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It grows in dry, rocky areas and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This species is often found in regions with low rainfall and high temperatures. It is a member of the baobab family, known for its unique and large tree structure.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is considered endangered due to habitat loss and overexploitation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adansonia somalensis was mainly introduced to arid and semi-arid regions of Somalia and neighboring countries.</p>
<p>It is adapted to thrive in harsh desert environments with low rainfall. The plant is commonly found in rocky soils and along dry riverbeds. Its introduction has helped stabilize soil and provide habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>However, it faces threats from overgrazing and habitat degradation.</p>
