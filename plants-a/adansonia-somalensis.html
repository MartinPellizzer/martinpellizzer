<p>Adansonia somalensis, commonly known as the Somali baobab, is a tree native to the arid regions of Somalia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Adansonia genus, which includes all baobab species, and is characterized by its massive, bottle-shaped trunk and thick, fibrous bark. The tree is well adapted to dry climates, storing water in its trunk and having deep root systems to access underground moisture. Its leaves are palmate, consisting of several lobes, and it produces large, white flowers that bloom during the rainy season.</p>
<p>The fruit is a hairy, woody capsule that contains edible seeds and pulp, which have been used for food and traditional medicine by local communities.</p>
