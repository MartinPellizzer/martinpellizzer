<p>Amomum araneosum, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a member of the ginger family, Zingiberaceae.</p>

The plant is characterized by its striking, spider-like inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, fragrant flowers arranged in a spiral pattern. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its tropical habitat.</p>
