                    <h1>Arenaria rossii var. daethiana</h1>
<p>Arenaria rossii var. daethiana, commonly known as the Ross's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Its leaves are usually succulent and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited geographic distribution.</p>
