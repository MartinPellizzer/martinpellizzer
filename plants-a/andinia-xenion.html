                    <h1>Andinia xenion</h1>
<p>Andinia xenion, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white petals and a unique, elongated flower spike that resembles a ghostly apparition. The plant thrives in swampy, nutrient-poor environments and is often found growing on the roots of mangrove trees. Its botanical structure includes a slender, root-like stem and a single, showy flower that blooms once a year.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Andinia xenion is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
