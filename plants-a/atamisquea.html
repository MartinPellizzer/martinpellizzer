                    <h1>Atamisquea</h1>
<p>Atamisquea, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and yellow or golden-colored flowers that bloom in the spring. Atamisquea species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
