                        <h1>Acantholimon karatavicum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon karatavicum, commonly known as the Karatavicum thrift, is a perennial flowering plant native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit with dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant features needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, semi-desert environments.</p>
<p>Acantholimon karatavicum is often used in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its hardiness and attractive blooms.</p>
