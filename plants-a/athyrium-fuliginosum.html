<p>Athyrium fuliginosum, commonly known as the smoky wood fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a feathery appearance, with a dark green hue and a slightly smoky or grayish tint on the underside. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Athyrium fuliginosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions.</p>
