                    <h1>Agrostis pubescens</h1>
<p>Agrostis pubescens, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs, giving it a silky appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and used in turfgrass mixtures.</p>
