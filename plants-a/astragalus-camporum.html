                    <h1>Astragalus camporum</h1>
<p>Astragalus camporum, commonly known as mountain milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and fibrous, which helps it survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Astragalus camporum is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
