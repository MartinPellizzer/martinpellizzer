                    <h1>Azorella corymbosa</h1>
<p>Azorella corymbosa, commonly known as the Chilean cushion plant, is a unique evergreen shrub native to the high Andes of Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It forms dense, low-growing cushions of tightly packed foliage, which helps it survive in harsh, cold, and arid conditions. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a thick layer of white, waxy cuticle, reducing water loss in its dry environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in the summer months.</p>
<p>Azorella corymbosa is well adapted to high-altitude ecosystems and is often found growing on rocky slopes and in alpine meadows.</p>
