<p>Acalypha leptomyura, commonly known as the slender-leaf spurflower, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with unique floral structures. The plant is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and small, clustered flowers that are often surrounded by colorful bracts. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or near streams.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha leptomyura has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth surface and a bright green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a light green to pale brown bark that becomes rough with age. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in spikes, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed schizocarp that splits into three parts, each containing a single seed, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
