<p>Atriplex gardneri var. falcata, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, falcate (sickle-shaped) leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are often inconspicuous compared to its robust foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to tolerate high salinity and drought, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
