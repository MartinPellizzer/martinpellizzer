                <h1>Acer kuomeii</h1>
<p>Acer kuomeii, commonly known as the Huangshan maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in autumn, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its bark is smooth and greyish-brown. It typically grows in mountainous regions and prefers well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Acer kuomeii is valued for its ecological role and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer kuomeii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicle clusters during late spring, with separate male and female flowers, and it is wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to its natural habitat in mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer kuomeii is a rare species of maple native to the mountainous regions of southern China, specifically in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to a few isolated areas within this region. Currently, it is found primarily in its native habitat with limited cultivation outside of China. It thrives in moist, shaded environments at altitudes between 2,000 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat loss, Acer kuomeii is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer kuomeii is a unique maple species known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The growth cycle of Acer kuomeii involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent moisture without waterlogging. Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer kuomeii is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, which are essential for its reproduction and the health of the ecosystem. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity by creating microhabitats. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer kuomeii contributes to carbon sequestration, enhancing its ecological benefits in forested areas.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer kuomeii is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been traditionally used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits. The tree contributes to local economies through timber and ornamental horticulture, supporting industries that rely on its aesthetic and structural properties. Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty in Chinese landscapes, often featured in art and poetry.</p>
<p>Its role in maintaining biodiversity and providing habitat for wildlife further underscores its ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>

<p>Popular cultivars include 'Variegatum' and 'Atrosanguineum', which are known for their striking foliage colors. Hybrids of Acer kuomeii are often created to enhance traits such as growth habit, leaf color, and hardiness. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions.</p>
<p>They are widely used in landscaping and as specimen trees in temperate climates.</p>
