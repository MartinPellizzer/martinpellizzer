                <h1>Acronychia pullei</h1>
<p>Acronychia pullei, commonly known as the silky ash or silky tallowwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other tropical hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and dark green, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-yellow, and it produces woody, elongated fruits that contain smooth, flat seeds.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its durable timber, which is used in furniture and construction.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia pullei has compound, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and are arranged along the stems.</p>
<p>The stems are slender and woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin strips. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the wet season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in water absorption and soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia pullei is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. It thrives in the understorey of dense vegetation, where it receives partial shade. Acronychia pullei is often associated with moist, nutrient-rich environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within New Guinea due to its particular ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia pullei was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique fruit. It has been introduced to some parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands as well.</p>
<p>However, its spread is generally limited to regions with suitable environmental conditions.</p>
