<p>Astragalus hendelanicus, commonly known as the Hendel's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky environments and has a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Astragalus hendelanicus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
