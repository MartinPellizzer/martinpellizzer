                <h1>Achnatherum webberi</h1>
<p>Achnatherum webberi, commonly known as Webber's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and open woodlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are clustered in dense panicles. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in regions with low precipitation.</p>
<p>Achnatherum webberi plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum webberi has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and range from 10 to 30 centimeters in length, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, growing upright with a branching pattern near the top. The flowers are spike-like inflorescences composed of small, wind-pollinated florets that are greenish-yellow in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. The fruit is a small, dry achene enclosed in a bract, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in dry, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum webberi is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in regions of California, Nevada, and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open, dry, and often disturbed habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and rocky soils. This species thrives in areas with low precipitation and full sun exposure. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid environments of the Great Basin and coastal ranges.</p>
<p>Achnatherum webberi plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum webberi was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, grazing lands, and disturbed grasslands.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high precipitation and full sun exposure. This species is commonly found in the western United States, particularly in states like Nevada, Utah, and Arizona. Its introduction has led to its spread across various ecological zones, often outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is now considered an invasive species in some areas where it has established itself.</p>
