                <h1>Achyranthes helleri</h1>
<p>Achyranthes helleri, commonly known as Heller's smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purplish in color, especially along the veins. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, terminal spikes and bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often used in wetland restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes helleri has ovate to lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes helleri is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open habitats such as forest edges, grasslands, and disturbed sites. It is often seen growing along roadsides and in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into parts of India and Indonesia as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes helleri was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and is often found in the understory of forests or along stream banks. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings. It has been reported in several countries, including parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas, often as an invasive species.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, Achyranthes helleri can outcompete native vegetation, altering local ecosystems and reducing biodiversity.</p>
