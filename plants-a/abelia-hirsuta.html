<p>Abelia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy abelia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. It thrives in partial to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Abelia hirsuta is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abelia hirsuta has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a pointed tip and toothed edges, arranged oppositely along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are medium-sized, typically 2-5 cm long, and have a dark green upper surface with a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The stems are slender, woody, and often have a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough and fissured with age. The flowers are clustered in umbels, featuring showy white to pale pink tubular petals that bloom in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelia hirsuta is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries like China, Vietnam, and Cambodia.</p>
<p>While it was historically confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in gardens and botanical collections across the globe, particularly in temperate climates. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial shade to full sun, often growing in forest understories or along stream banks. It typically occurs at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters, where the climate is cool and humid.</p>
<p>Currently, Abelia hirsuta is not considered threatened, but its wild populations remain relatively rare and are sometimes protected in conservation areas.</p>
