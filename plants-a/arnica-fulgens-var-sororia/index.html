<p>arnica fulgens var. sororia is a striking perennial plant known for its vibrant yellow flowers and medicinal properties. it thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often found in the mountainous regions of europe and north america. this variant of arnica is particularly noted for its larger, more showy blooms compared to other varieties. its active compounds have been used for centuries in traditional medicine to treat inflammation and skin conditions. despite its benefits, it is important to handle this plant with care as it can be toxic if ingested.</p>
