                <h1>Acinodendron anisophyllum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron anisophyllum, commonly known as the variable-leaf acinodendron, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its simple, opposite, and often variable in shape leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round berries. Its leaves are typically leathery and may have a slightly aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Acinodendron anisophyllum is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or savanna habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron anisophyllum has alternate, simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as an upright shrub. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron anisophyllum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and well-drained soil. It is often associated with coastal and swampy habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron anisophyllum was mainly introduced to areas with suitable climates for its growth, such as tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. Its introduction is often linked to human activities such as agriculture and land clearing.</p>
<p>However, its spread can have ecological impacts on native plant communities.</p>
