<p>Adiantum asperum, commonly known as the rough maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Adiantaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, finely serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Adiantum asperum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance.</p>
