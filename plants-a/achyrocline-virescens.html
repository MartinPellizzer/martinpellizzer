                <h1>Achyrocline virescens</h1>
<p>Achyrocline virescens, commonly known as green everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is known for its resilience to salt spray and wind. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and white to pale blue, blooming in clusters that resemble a cluster of tiny stars.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline virescens has simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown color and an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, tubular, and arranged in clusters, with white to pale blue petals blooming from April to June, and they are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline virescens is primarily native to Colombia.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions across the country, particularly in the Andean mountain ranges. This plant thrives in humid, tropical, and subtropical climates. It is commonly found in forests and shaded areas with high moisture levels.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely restricted to Colombia, where it plays an important ecological role.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline virescens was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is an invasive plant species that has spread throughout various ecosystems there. The plant was likely introduced through human activity, such as accidental transport on ships or intentional planting. It thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it poses a threat to local biodiversity and ecosystem health.</p>
