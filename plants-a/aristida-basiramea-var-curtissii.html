                    <h1>Aristida basiramea var. curtissii</h1>
<p>Aristida basiramea var. curtissii, commonly known as the narrowleaf threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, three-awned flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a component of native plant gardens.</p>
