                    <h1>Acaena microphylla var. pauciglochidiata</h1>
<p>Acaena microphylla var. pauciglochidiata, commonly known as the small-fruited New Zealand burr, is a species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, rounded leaves. The plant produces bright red, spherical fruits that are covered in hooked bracts, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. It thrives in coastal and subalpine regions, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its reduced number of glochids, making it less prickly than other Acaena species.</p>
