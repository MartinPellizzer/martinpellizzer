<p>Alsophila glauca, commonly known as the blue hakea, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, dark green fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for many decades, making it a long-lived component of its native ecosystem. Its fronds are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the trunk, and the plant produces spores in clusters on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Alsophila glauca thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and forested areas.</p>
