                <h1>Achyranthes robusta</h1>
<p>Achyranthes robusta, commonly known as the Indian knotgrass, is a robust annual herb native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a stout, branched stem that is often covered with short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and its seed capsules are triangular in shape. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional medicine for various health purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes robusta has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 5–15 cm long and 2–6 cm wide, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat woody, with a rough, brownish bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with greenish-white bracts and stamens, blooming from July to September, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-winged schizocarp, dispersing by wind due to its light, feathery seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes robusta is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, fertile soils in lowland areas and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in warm climates with high humidity and is often associated with wetlands and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its wide native range reflects its adaptability to diverse environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes robusta was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a potential weed in certain regions. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in open areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
