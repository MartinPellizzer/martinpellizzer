                    <h1>Arenaria stenophylla</h1>
<p>Arenaria stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, clustered in racemes, and bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its cold, high-altitude habitat.</p>
