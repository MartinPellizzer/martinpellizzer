                    <h1>Aspalathus corniculata</h1>
<p>Aspalathus corniculata, commonly known as the African tea or rooibos, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its needle-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its most notable feature is the unique, reddish-brown color of its leaves, which gives it the common name "rooibos," meaning "red bush" in Afrikaans.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its use in herbal teas, as its leaves contain no caffeine and are rich in antioxidants.</p>
