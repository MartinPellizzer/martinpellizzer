                <h1>Adenocalymma bracteosum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma bracteosum, commonly known as the velvetleaf sunflower, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has hairy, broad leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is typically found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma bracteosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma bracteosum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stems are cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma bracteosum is primarily native to Brazil North, Brazil Northeast, Colombia, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in areas with moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with lowland and coastal habitats. The plant is typically found in dense vegetation, including rainforests and secondary growth areas.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of northeastern South America and the Caribbean.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma bracteosum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of botanical collections and horticultural experiments. The plant is now considered a non-native species in the region. It has adapted well to the local climate and has been found in various habitats.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still under study.</p>
