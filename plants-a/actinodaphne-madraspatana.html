<p>Actinodaphne madraspatana, commonly known as the Madras camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elliptical, dark purple fruits. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a smooth surface and a fragrant aroma.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its medicinal properties and is also used in traditional practices for its essential oils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne madraspatana has simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age. It produces small, clustered flowers with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the monsoon season, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, three-lobed drupe that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by birds and through wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne madraspatana is a small evergreen tree native to the western Ghats of southern India.</p>
<p>It is currently found in the states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, where it thrives in moist, humid environments. This species prefers shaded undergrowth in tropical rainforests and is typically found at altitudes between 600 and 1,200 meters. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is classified as vulnerable by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are needed to protect its natural habitat and ensure its survival in the wild.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne madraspatana is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia, known for its fragrant leaves and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The plant grows best in warm, humid climates with a slow to moderate growth cycle during the growing season.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to shape the plant and remove dead foliage are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally suffer from scale insects or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants like ginger or ornamental grasses can enhance its growth and aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne madraspatana is a valuable plant species that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the reproductive success of both itself and other plants in the ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of nearby species through mutualistic relationships. Additionally, it plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Its ecological benefits extend beyond just supporting local fauna, as it contributes to overall biodiversity and habitat integrity.</p>
