                <h1>Actinopappus drummondii</h1>
<p>Actinopappus drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's thistle, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. Its leaves are generally lobed or toothed, and the flowers are usually yellow, with a distinctive purple or brown coloration on the bracts.</p>
<p>The plant produces a crown of persistent, woolly bracts that give it a unique appearance and aid in seed dispersal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinopappus drummondii has simple, alternate leaves that are lance-shaped, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and slightly woody, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows in a sprawling or ascending pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus of bristles, which allows for wind dispersal, and the seeds are tiny and light.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinopappus drummondii is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in states such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, as well as parts of Sonora and Chihuahua in Mexico. This plant typically grows in rocky soils and is often associated with desert and semi-arid environments. It is commonly found in areas with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to specific habitats that provide the necessary conditions for its growth and survival.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinopappus drummondii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and areas with recent land clearing.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is commonly found in regions with temperate climates. The plant has spread across various parts of North America, particularly in the western United States. Its ability to establish quickly makes it a potential invasive species in some ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
