                <h1>Acilepis tonkinensis</h1>
<p>Acilepis tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin acacia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, and it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis tonkinensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a smooth upper surface and slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis tonkinensis is primarily native to Thailand and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical regions of these countries. It typically grows in lowland areas with moist, shaded environments. The species is commonly associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis tonkinensis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high humidity and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges. This plant is commonly cultivated in horticultural settings for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage. It has been reported in several countries in Southeast Asia, including Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Its distribution is expanding due to human activities and climate change, making it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
