                    <h1>Androsace tibetica var. mariae</h1>
<p>Androsace tibetica var. mariae, commonly known as the Tibetan mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy trichomes, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
