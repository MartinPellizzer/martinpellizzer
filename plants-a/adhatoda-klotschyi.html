                <h1>Adhatoda klotschyi</h1>
<p>Adhatoda klotschyi, commonly known as the African skullcap, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale blue or violet, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves, which contain various bioactive compounds.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to withstand periods of drought.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda klotschyi has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, woody, and has a rough, bark-like texture, typically ranging in color from brown to gray, with a growth pattern that is upright and branching. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with a tubular structure and five lobes, displaying a striking blue or violet color, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by birds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and absorbing nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda klotschyi is primarily native to parts of East Africa, including Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant typically grows in open woodland, savanna, and along riverbanks. It is well adapted to the warm and humid climates of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Adhatoda klotschyi is an important component of the local flora and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda klotschyi was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in tropical and subtropical environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with rich, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. This plant has been introduced to several parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines, as an ornamental and medicinal species. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in some local ecosystems, sometimes competing with native flora.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>
