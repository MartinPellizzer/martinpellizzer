                    <h1>Aloe miskatana</h1>
<p>Aloe miskatana, commonly known as the Socotra aloe, is a succulent plant native to the Socotra archipelago.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear yellowish-green flowers, typically blooming in the spring. Aloe miskatana is well adapted to coastal and rocky habitats, thriving in full sun and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
