                        <h1>Acacia rutifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia rutifolia, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, feathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, which attract various pollinators such as bees and birds. Acacia rutifolia is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>

<p>It is commonly found in the states of Western Australia, South Australia, and Northern Territory. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with spinifex grasslands. It is well adapted to dry conditions and can tolerate high temperatures.</p>
<p>Acacia rutifolia is an important component of the local flora and provides habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia rutifolia was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant has also been introduced for its ornamental value, with its unique foliage and flowering patterns attracting gardeners. It is often planted along roadsides and in degraded landscapes to improve land stability.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain environments.</p>
