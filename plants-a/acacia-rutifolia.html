<p>Acacia rutifolia, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, feathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, which attract various pollinators such as bees and birds. Acacia rutifolia is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
