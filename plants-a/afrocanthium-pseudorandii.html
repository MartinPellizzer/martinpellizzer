                    <h1>Afrocanthium pseudorandii</h1>
<p>Afrocanthium pseudorandii, commonly known as the African sandstone cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branched stem covered in short, spiny hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, adapting to low rainfall conditions.</p>
<p>Afrocanthium pseudorandii is often found growing on rocky outcrops and sandy soils, showcasing its resilience to extreme climates.</p>
