                <h1>Adenosacme flava</h1>
<p>Adenosacme flava, commonly known as yellow bellflower, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellowish-orange bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adenosacme flava is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosacme flava has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically measuring around 2-4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are yellow in color, featuring five petals and stamens, and bloom during the spring season, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosacme flava is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, including rocky outcrops and sandy soils. The plant thrives in areas with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure. It is often seen growing along the edges of grasslands and in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Adenosacme flava is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosacme flava was mainly introduced to new habitats due to its adaptability and rapid growth rate.</p>
<p>It has been found in various regions, including parts of the United States and Europe, where it thrives in disturbed soils and open areas. This plant is often considered an invasive species because it can outcompete native vegetation for resources. Its introduction has led to concerns about ecological imbalance in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor and control its spread to protect native plant communities.</p>
