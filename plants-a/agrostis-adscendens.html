<p>Agrostis adscendens, commonly known as the ascending bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Agrostis adscendens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a turfgrass.</p>
