                    <h1>Abolboda abbreviata</h1>
<p>Abolboda abbreviata, commonly known as the short-stemmed euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, bushy growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically small and may be reduced to spines, a common adaptation in desert plants to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Abolboda abbreviata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
