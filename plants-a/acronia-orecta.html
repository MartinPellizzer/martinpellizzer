                <h1>Acronia orecta</h1>
<p>Acronia orecta, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Acronia orecta is known for its vibrant red or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia orecta has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils by forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia orecta is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant thrives in sandy or loamy soils that are consistently moist. It is often associated with coastal and inland wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of healthy wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia orecta was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained conditions. This plant has adapted well to a variety of climates, allowing it to spread beyond its native range. Its rapid growth and ability to produce numerous seeds contribute to its successful establishment in introduced areas.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential remains a topic of ongoing ecological study.</p>
