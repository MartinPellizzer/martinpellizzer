                    <h1>Aspidopterys wallichii var. dehradunensis</h1>
<p>Aspidopterys wallichii var. dehradunensis, commonly known as the Dehradun Himalayan fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the Himalayan region of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive frond structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in lines along the veins.</p>
<p>This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features.</p>
