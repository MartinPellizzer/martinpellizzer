                    <h1>Agathorhiza</h1>
<p>Agathorhiza, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique ability to absorb nutrients through its roots directly from the air, a process called epiphytic growth. The plant typically grows on tree branches in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its flowers, which are usually pale green or white, are delicate and bloom in clusters, adding to its mysterious appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Agathorhiza is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
