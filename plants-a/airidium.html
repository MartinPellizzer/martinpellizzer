                    <h1>Airidium</h1>
<p>Airidium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom on a single stem, often without leaves. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It requires specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and filtered light, to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
