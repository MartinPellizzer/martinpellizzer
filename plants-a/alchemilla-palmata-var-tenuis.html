<p>Alchemilla palmata var. tenuis, commonly known as narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and delicate floral display.</p>
