                <h1>Acer pilosum</h1>
<p>Acer pilosum, commonly known as the downy maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely hairy leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more rugged with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pilosum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green during the growing season and turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, with two papery wings, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pilosum is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely restricted to its native range due to habitat loss and limited cultivation. It thrives in temperate climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils along forest edges or in mountain valleys. Acer pilosum typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>It is considered a rare species, with a conservation status of vulnerable due to habitat degradation and over-collection.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pilosum is a small, ornamental maple known for its delicate, fuzzy leaves and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification to break dormancy and cuttings rooted in moist sand for best results. The growth cycle of Acer pilosum is relatively slow, with new shoots emerging in spring and foliage maturing by early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, needing regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune dead or damaged branches to maintain shape and promote air circulation. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with neem oil or proper sanitation.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving perennials or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pilosum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. Its dense foliage acts as a companion plant, supporting biodiversity in mixed forest ecosystems. The tree also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to soil health by improving nutrient cycling in the ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pilosum is a species of maple tree known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In industrial contexts, its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain, making it suitable for furniture and carving. Culturally, it is often symbolized as a representation of resilience and beauty in various regions where it grows.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting local biodiversity also makes it important for environmental conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pilosum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Atrosanguineum' and 'Purpureum', known for their striking foliage colors. Hybrids of Acer pilosum are often created to enhance traits such as growth habit, disease resistance, and fall coloration. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their adaptability and aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>They are widely used in ornamental horticulture for their unique leaf patterns and seasonal color changes.</p>
