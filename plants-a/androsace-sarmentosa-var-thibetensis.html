                    <h1>Androsace sarmentosa var. thibetensis</h1>
<p>Androsace sarmentosa var. thibetensis, commonly known as the Tibetan sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Tibet.</p>
<p>It features a dense mat of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for alpine gardens and rockeries.</p>
