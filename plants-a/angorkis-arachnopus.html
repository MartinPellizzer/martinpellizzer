<p>Angorkis arachnopus, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance due to its long, thin, and often hairy stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires careful cultivation due to its specific ecological needs.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this endangered species from habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
