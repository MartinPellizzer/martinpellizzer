<p>Athyriopsis dickasonii, commonly known as the Dickason's water fern, is a species of fern native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water or damp soil, thriving in humid environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Athyriopsis dickasonii plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
