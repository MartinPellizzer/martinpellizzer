                    <h1>Asperula tomentosa var. crassifolia</h1>
<p>Asperula tomentosa var. crassifolia, commonly known as the woolly woodruff, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are covered in a thick, woolly white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry, sunny landscapes.</p>
