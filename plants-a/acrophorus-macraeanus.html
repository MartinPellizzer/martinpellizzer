                <h1>Acrophorus macraeanus</h1>
<p>Acrophorus macraeanus, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are ovate and have a rough texture, while its flowers bloom during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Acrophorus macraeanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrophorus macraeanus has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that exudes a mild fragrance. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus macraeanus is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of Africa, including countries such as Tanzania, Kenya, and Mozambique.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas with a preference for moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open woodland and forest margins, often in areas with high humidity. It is also present in parts of Madagascar and the Comoros Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus macraeanus was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils. The plant is often planted in areas where native vegetation has been degraded by human activity. Its rapid growth and dense foliage help suppress the spread of weeds.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive itself.</p>
