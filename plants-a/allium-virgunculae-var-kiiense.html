<p>Allium virgunculae var. kiiense, commonly known as Kii garlic, is a rare and ornamental plant native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is a bulbous perennial characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, though they are not as commonly cultivated as other Allium species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
