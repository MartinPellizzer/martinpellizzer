                    <h1>Anthoxanthum odoratum var. humile</h1>
<p>Anthoxanthum odoratum var. humile, commonly known as sweet vernalgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is noted for its sweet, honey-like fragrance, which is most noticeable when the flowers are in bloom. It is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is less common than the typical sweet vernalgrass and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits.</p>
