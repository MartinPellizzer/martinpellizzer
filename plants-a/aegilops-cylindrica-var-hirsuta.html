<p>Aegilops cylindrica var. hirsuta, commonly known as goatgrass, is a wild annual grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and spike-like inflorescence composed of small, bracteate spikelets. The plant produces awned lemmas and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields. It has been studied for its potential role in wheat genetics due to its close relation to cultivated wheat species.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots and adaptability to various soil types make it a resilient weed in temperate climates.</p>
