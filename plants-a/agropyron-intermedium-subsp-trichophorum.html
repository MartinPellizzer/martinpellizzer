<p>Agropyron intermedium subsp.</p>
<p>trichophorum, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
