                    <h1>Aechmea paniculigera var. parviflora</h1>
<p>Aechmea paniculigera var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central rosette, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant produces striking inflorescences with small, vibrant flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
