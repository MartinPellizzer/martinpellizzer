                        <h1>Abies vulgaris</h1>
<p>Abies vulgaris, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its dense, dark green foliage that is often covered in a layer of white, powdery wax. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that hang from the branches, containing seeds surrounded by a papery wing. Its bark is typically gray to brown, becoming furrowed with age, and its roots are deep and extensive, helping to stabilize soil in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The white fir is valued for its timber and is also a popular ornamental plant in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies vulgaris is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Carpathian Mountains, the Alps, and the Caucasus region. This species thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and ample sunlight. It is often associated with mixed forests and can be found at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has adapted to a variety of environmental conditions within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies vulgaris was mainly introduced to North America during the 19th century as part of ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>It was cultivated for its attractive conical shape and evergreen foliage, making it a popular choice for landscaping. Despite its ornamental value, it has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its spread has been facilitated by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its rapid growth rate.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now underway to control its expansion and protect local ecosystems.</p>
