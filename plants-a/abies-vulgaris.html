<p>Abies vulgaris, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its dense, dark green foliage that is often covered in a layer of white, powdery wax. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that hang from the branches, containing seeds surrounded by a papery wing. Its bark is typically gray to brown, becoming furrowed with age, and its roots are deep and extensive, helping to stabilize soil in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The white fir is valued for its timber and is also a popular ornamental plant in gardens and parks.</p>
