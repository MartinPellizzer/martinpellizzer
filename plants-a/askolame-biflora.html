<p>Askolame biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered beauty, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features striking, bi-colored flowers that range from deep violet to pale lavender, often with intricate patterns. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves covered in a fine, silvery pubescence that helps reflect intense sunlight. Its blooming period occurs during the short, cool season in late winter to early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Askolame biflora is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
