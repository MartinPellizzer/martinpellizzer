                <h1>Aegiphila compacta</h1>
<p>Aegiphila compacta, commonly known as the compact aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, often hairy leaves. It produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>Aegiphila compacta is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila compacta has compact, dense foliage with small, ovate leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, typically measuring 1â€“2 cm in length and displaying a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is short and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unbranched. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense umbels, featuring pinkish-white petals that bloom in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or arid soils.</p>
