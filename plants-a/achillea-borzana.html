                <h1>Achillea borzana</h1>
<p>Achillea borzana, commonly known as narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems that bear small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters. The leaves are linear and aromatic, with a fern-like appearance, and they are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties have been historically valued for their anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea borzana has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown color and a upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green composite blooms that appear in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene that is dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping the plant anchor in rocky or poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea borzana is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution has expanded slightly due to horticultural interest, with some cultivated populations in botanical gardens and greenhouses outside its native range. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and open grasslands, often found in well-drained soils. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, Achillea borzana is considered to be of conservation concern, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea borzana is a hardy perennial plant known for its finely divided, fern-like foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a period of active growth in spring, flowering in summer, and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper spacing and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea borzana is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also attracts beneficial insects and birds, contributing to biodiversity in its ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of neighboring species by improving soil conditions. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land in various habitats.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea borzana plays an important ecological role in maintaining the health and balance of local environments.</p>
