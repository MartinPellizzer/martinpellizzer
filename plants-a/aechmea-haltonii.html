                <h1>Aechmea haltonii</h1>
<p>Aechmea haltonii, commonly known as the Halton bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure, which forms a central cup to collect water and nutrients. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, and they can grow up to 30 cm in length. It produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea haltonii has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, stiff, and dark green with a waxy coating, arranged in a compact spiral pattern around the central stem.</p>
<p>The stem is short and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains hidden beneath the dense foliage. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by colorful bracts, producing white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that turn red when mature, dispersing seeds through birds and water.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding environment.</p>
