                        <h1>Abronia × alba var. platyphylla</h1>
<p>Abronia × alba var. platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically oval to heart-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is a hybrid between Abronia × alba and A. platyphylla, exhibiting traits from both parent species.</p>
