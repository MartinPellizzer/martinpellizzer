                <h1>Acronychia oblongifolia</h1>
<p>Acronychia oblongifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to northern Australia and is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a spherical, woody drupe that contains a single seed.</p>
<p>Acronychia oblongifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia oblongifolia has compound, alternate leaves that are elliptical to oblong in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia oblongifolia is primarily native to New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal and subtropical regions of these Australian states. This plant typically grows in rainforest or woodland areas with moist, well-drained soils. It is often seen in the understorey of forests, where it thrives in partial shade.</p>
<p>Acronychia oblongifolia is an important part of the local flora and is valued for its ecological and horticultural significance.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia oblongifolia was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in humid conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It has been introduced to several parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by its specific environmental requirements and lack of naturalized growth in many regions.</p>
