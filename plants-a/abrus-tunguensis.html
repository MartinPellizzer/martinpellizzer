                        <h1>Abrus tunguensis</h1>
<p>Abrus tunguensis, commonly known as the velvet bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, ornate pods that contain flat, kidney-shaped seeds. The plant is notable for its striking red and black seeds, which are often used in traditional crafts and as a source of pigment. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, and it thrives in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>However, the plant is toxic due to the presence of abrin, a potent lectin that can be harmful if ingested.</p>
