                <h1>Acinodendron muricatum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron muricatum, commonly known as the rough acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenia, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features simple, opposite leaves with a rough, textured surface, and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruits are follicles that contain several seeds, and the plant is often found in humid, mountainous environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron muricatum has leaves that are elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a rough, fissured bark that is grayish-brown in color, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soils where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron muricatum is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in cloud forests and humid montane environments at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This plant thrives in areas with high rainfall and moderate temperatures, often growing in shaded understory conditions. It is an important component of the local biodiversity and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the Andes.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron muricatum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is typically established in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and can spread rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind and water. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several countries in South America and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
