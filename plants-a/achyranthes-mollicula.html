                <h1>Achyranthes mollicula</h1>
<p>Achyranthes mollicula, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means, it is considered a weed in many agricultural settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes mollicula has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth green upper surface and a lighter, fuzzy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a slightly hairy texture and a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age. Its flowers are small, greenish-white structures arranged in clusters, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes mollicula is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant is typically associated with forest understories and is often found near water sources. It has a widespread distribution across the region and is well adapted to the humid climate.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance, it plays an important role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes mollicula was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as a potential ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become an invasive species, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now widespread across much of the North Island.</p>
