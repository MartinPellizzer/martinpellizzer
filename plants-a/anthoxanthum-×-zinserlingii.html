                    <h1>Anthoxanthum × zinserlingii</h1>
<p>Anthoxanthum × zinserlingii, commonly known as the hybrid meadowgrass, is a sterile, diploid grass species resulting from the cross between Anthoxanthum odoratum and Anthoxanthum avenaceum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in panicles, and it is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds, relying instead on vegetative propagation for spread.</p>
