<p>Astragalus rhabdophorus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Astragalus rhabdophorus is often found in steppe and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
