                    <h1>Astragalus vaginans</h1>
<p>Astragalus vaginans, commonly known as the bladderleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated leaf sheaths that resemble bladders, a feature that helps it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Astragalus vaginans is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited rainfall.</p>
