<p>Aristolochia cucurbitifolia, commonly known as the pumpkin vine, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, tubular, maroon-colored flowers that resemble a pipe. The plant produces yellow-orange berries that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, aromatic pulp. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>However, it is toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of aristolochic acid.</p>
