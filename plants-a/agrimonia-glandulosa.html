<p>Agrimonia glandulosa, commonly known as sticky agrimony, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>

The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges and are covered in fine, sticky hairs.</p>
<p>Agrimonia glandulosa is often found in dry meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
