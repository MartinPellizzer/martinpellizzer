                <h1>Adesmia oxalidiphylla</h1>
<p>Adesmia oxalidiphylla, commonly known as the yellow burr legume, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes and beans, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in spiny, spherical pods, which aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Adesmia oxalidiphylla is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia oxalidiphylla has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with yellow petals and a distinctive cup-shaped structure, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia oxalidiphylla is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and the Orange Free State. This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats like grasslands and coastal areas. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Adesmia oxalidiphylla is often seen in coastal dunes and other dry, sun-exposed environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia oxalidiphylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides, where it thrives in sunny to partially shaded conditions. Despite its aesthetic value, it has shown invasive tendencies in certain areas, outcompeting native species for resources. The plant prefers well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subcoastal regions.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
