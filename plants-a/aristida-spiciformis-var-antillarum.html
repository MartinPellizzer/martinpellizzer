                    <h1>Aristida spiciformis var. antillarum</h1>
<p>Aristida spiciformis var. antillarum, commonly known as the Antillean wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, thriving in humid, tropical climates. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight sheen, and it is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other species in the Aristida genus, sharing similar structural and ecological characteristics.</p>
