                <h1>Acianthera hastulata</h1>
<p>Acianthera hastulata, commonly known as the sword orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves and striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Acianthera hastulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera hastulata has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and has a greenish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera hastulata is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the southeastern region of Brazil, particularly in states such as SÃ£o Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Rio de Janeiro. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in shaded forest understories. The plant is adapted to the humid and warm climate of this region.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes both primary and secondary forests, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships for its survival.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera hastulata was mainly introduced to gardens and greenhouses as an ornamental plant due to its attractive flowers and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It is native to South America but has been cultivated in various regions with suitable climates. The distribution of this plant has expanded beyond its native range, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. It is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodland gardens and rockeries.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
