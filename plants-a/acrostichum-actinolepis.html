                <h1>Acrostichum actinolepis</h1>
<p>Acrostichum actinolepis, commonly known as the broadleaf tree fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a sturdy, trunk-like stem covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, meaning they have secondary pinnae that are arranged in a fan-like pattern.</p>
<p>Acrostichum actinolepis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum actinolepis has large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically broad and dark green, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually lance-shaped with a smooth margin and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The stem is erect and woody, with a rough, grayish bark that provides structural support. This plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the summer months and are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a cluster of dry, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, while the roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum actinolepis is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in swampy and wetland habitats, particularly in mangrove forests and coastal areas. This plant thrives in brackish water environments and is often associated with estuaries and tidal mudflats. Its distribution is also reported in parts of New Guinea and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>Acrostichum actinolepis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum actinolepis was mainly introduced to coastal and swampy areas where it can thrive in moist, saline environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. This plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its introduction has helped in rehabilitating degraded wetland habitats.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native ecosystems.</p>
