                    <h1>Aconitum lycoctonum var. brevicalcaratum</h1>
<p>Aconitum lycoctonum var. brevicalcaratum, commonly known as the short-spurred aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a tall, unbranched stem that is often covered in dense, glandular hairs. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments that are usually hairy on both surfaces.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its shorter, more compact spurs on the flowers compared to other aconite species.</p>
