<p>Abies neodurangensis, commonly known as the Durango fir, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, rounded cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds for wind dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high elevations, typically above 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
