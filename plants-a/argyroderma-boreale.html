                    <h1>Argyroderma boreale</h1>
<p>Argyroderma boreale, commonly known as the Arctic silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-white leaves, which are covered in dense, reflective hairs that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in nutrient-poor, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Argyroderma boreale plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is an important component of tundra ecosystems.</p>
