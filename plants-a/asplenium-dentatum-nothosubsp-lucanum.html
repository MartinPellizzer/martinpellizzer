<p>Asplenium dentatum nothosubsp.</p>
<p>lucanum, commonly known as the toothed spleenwort, is a fern that belongs to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves with serrated margins, which give it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rock crevices or on tree trunks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies is a hybrid form that exhibits unique morphological traits distinct from its parent species.</p>
