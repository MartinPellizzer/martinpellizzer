<p>Alopecurus geniculatus var. vinealis, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features fine, hair-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brown flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments.</p>
