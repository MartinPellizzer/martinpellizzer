                <h1>Adiantum rigidum</h1>
<p>Adiantum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum rigidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum rigidum has feather-like leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a bright green color and a slender, upright growth habit.</p>
<p>The plant has a slender, unbranched stem that is smooth and pale green, growing from a rhizome. It does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-bearing plant rather than a flowering plant. Its fruit is not applicable, as it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomes that spread horizontally beneath the soil, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum rigidum is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions such as Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments like forests and stream sides. This fern thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often seen growing in rocky crevices or along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into parts of Central America as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum rigidum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to manage its distribution and minimize its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
