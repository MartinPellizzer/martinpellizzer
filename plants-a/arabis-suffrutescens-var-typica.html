<p>Arabis suffrutescens var. typica, commonly known as the rock白菜 or rock mustard, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants.</p>
