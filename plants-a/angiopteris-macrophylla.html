<p>Angiopteris macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large fern species native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it often forms dense mats on the water surface. Its fronds are divided into numerous pinnae, which are broad and leathery in texture.</p>
<p>Angiopteris macrophylla plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
