                <h1>Acalypha retifera</h1>
<p>Acalypha retifera, commonly known as the slender false nettle, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Acalypha retifera is often found in moist, shady habitats such as forests and shrublands.</p>
<p>It is valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha retifera has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 3 to 8 cm in length, displaying a vibrant green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows in a spreading or upright manner. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with greenish-white petals, blooming during the summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed schizocarp that splits into three small nuts, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant anchor in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha retifera is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is now also cultivated in other tropical regions around the world, including parts of Africa and the Caribbean. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in lowland forests and along stream banks. It is usually found at altitudes below 1,000 meters, preferring humid and warm climates.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acalypha retifera is considered a species of concern in some areas, though its conservation status is not yet fully assessed.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha retifera is a tropical shrub known for its vibrant foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with stem cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and occasional pruning to maintain shape are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or citronella can help deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acalypha retifera is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The plant acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing the growth of neighboring crops.
