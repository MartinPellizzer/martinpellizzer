                <h1>Acronychia richards-beehleri</h1>
<p>Acronychia richards-beehleri, commonly known as the Richards-Beehler acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. The plant is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, leathery leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. Its flowers are small and yellowish, arranged in spikes, and it produces woody, spiny fruits that contain one or two seeds.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in subtropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia richards-beehleri has simple, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in inflorescences, bloom during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, smooth, yellow drupe that splits open to release one or two seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, helping it withstand periodic flooding in its wetland habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia richards-beehleri is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in the eastern and western regions. This plant typically grows in lowland and mountainous areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often encountered in primary and secondary forest habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within New Guinea's diverse flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia richards-beehleri was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in areas with humid climates and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland regions where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique fruiting structures. It has been introduced to several island nations as a horticultural species.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
