                    <h1>Abildgaardia capillaris</h1>
<p>Abildgaardia capillaris, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of tiny, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Abildgaardia capillaris is an important component of polar ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
