<p>Asplenium nidus var. bieriale, commonly known as the Basket Fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to form a rounded, basket-like structure. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with the fertile spore-bearing leaves emerging from the center. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used as a decorative plant in indoor settings.</p>
<p>The varietal form 'bieriale' is distinguished by its more compact growth and slightly different frond morphology compared to the typical variety.</p>
