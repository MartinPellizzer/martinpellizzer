<p>Agropyron scirpeum var. involucratum, commonly known as the woolly wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps stabilize soils in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces spikelets that are often covered with silky, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Its adaptability makes it an important species for ecological restoration and erosion control.</p>
