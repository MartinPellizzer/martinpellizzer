                        <h1>Acacia heterocarpa</h1>
<p>Acacia heterocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and small, phyllodes that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in woody pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Acacia heterocarpa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia heterocarpa is primarily native to northern Australia, including the Northern Territory, Western Australia, and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. This species thrives in coastal and inland areas, often growing in open woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the Australian outback.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is an important component of the local ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia heterocarpa was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the northern and western parts of the country. This plant has been introduced to various parts of the world, including parts of Africa and the Middle East, for its use in land stabilization and as a source of timber. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has sometimes become invasive in non-native environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely influenced by human activity and environmental conditions that support its growth.</p>
