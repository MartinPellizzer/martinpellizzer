                    <h1>Acacia heterocarpa</h1>
<p>Acacia heterocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and small, phyllodes that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in woody pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Acacia heterocarpa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems.</p>
