                <h1>Acrostichum notatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum notatum, commonly known as the common brake, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its pinnate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually dark green and have a rough texture, with spore-producing structures on the underside.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum notatum has long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in the spring and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed, three-winged samara that disperses by wind, allowing the seeds to travel considerable distances.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum notatum is primarily native to the tropical regions of the Americas, including Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangrove swamps, and humid lowland forests. This plant thrives in saline and brackish water environments, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. It is also present in parts of the Caribbean and the Pacific coast of Central America.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to wetland habitats where it can tolerate high moisture and salt levels.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum notatum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as a decorative plant. The species has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is often found growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered a major invasive species in New Zealand.</p>
