<p>Aridaria trichosantha, commonly known as the desert star, is a succulent plant adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or white, adding visual interest to its sparse habitat. It is native to regions with hot, dry climates, such as parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth patterns make it well-suited for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardening.</p>
