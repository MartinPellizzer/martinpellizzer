                <h1>Aegopodium brachycarpum</h1>
<p>Aegopodium brachycarpum, commonly known as lesser hogweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its biennial growth habit. The plant features a hollow, ridged stem with lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbrella-like inflorescences, typical of the carrot family.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and photodermatitis when exposed to sunlight.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegopodium brachycarpum has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically have a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and somewhat hairy, with a light green to brownish bark that remains smooth as the plant matures. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in umbels, blooming in early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene that is dispersed by wind due to its feathery pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in moist, disturbed soils.</p>
