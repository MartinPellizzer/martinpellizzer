                        <h1>Acalypha collina</h1>
<p>Acalypha collina, commonly known as silky fanflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are often surrounded by bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Acalypha collina is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique foliage and ability to add texture to gardens.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha collina is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in forest understories or along riverbanks. It is also present in parts of Oceania, including Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>Acalypha collina is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha collina was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticultural enthusiasts and gardeners. The plant has since become naturalized in certain areas, spreading through both seed dispersal and vegetative propagation. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is now classified as an invasive species in some regions of Hawaii.</p>
