                        <h1>Acacia obesa</h1>
<p>Acacia obesa, commonly known as the bottle tree, is a distinctive shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant has compound leaves that are often modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. Its yellow flowers are clustered in spherical heads and bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Acacia obesa plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various desert animals.</p>
