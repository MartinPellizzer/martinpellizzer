                <h1>Achillea magna</h1>
<p>Achillea magna, commonly known as giant yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 2 meters tall, adorned with feathery, finely divided leaves. The plant produces flat-topped clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and can spread extensively, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Achillea magna is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea magna has basal, fern-like leaves that are lance-shaped, dark green on top, and grayish-white underneath, with a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stems are sturdy, hairy, and upright, growing in a clump-forming pattern with a grayish-green color. Its flower heads consist of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray flowers, blooming in late spring to early summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea magna is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly the Pyrenees, Alps, and Carpathians.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to specific areas in southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes, meadows, and grasslands. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, Achillea magna is considered vulnerable, and its conservation status is of concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea magna is a hardy perennial plant known for its showy, fluffy yellow or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
