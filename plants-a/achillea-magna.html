                <h1>Achillea magna</h1>
<p>Achillea magna, commonly known as giant yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features a robust, branched stem that can grow up to 2 meters tall, with gray-green, fern-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped umbels. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>Achillea magna is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea magna has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern and reaching up to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-green color, growing from the base to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea magna is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly the Mediterranean region, including parts of Spain, Italy, and France.</p>
<p>It has been introduced to other areas, such as North America and Australia, where it now grows in gardens and naturalized areas. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats like grasslands, slopes, and disturbed areas. It typically grows at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to around 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its invasive potential in non-native regions has led to some conservation concerns.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea magna is a hardy perennial plant known for its showy, flat-topped flower heads and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, division, or stem cuttings, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining vigor. It has a cool-season growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot in poorly drained soil.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea magna is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit offers shelter and habitat for small insects and ground-dwelling wildlife. It acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting beneficial insect populations. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Achillea magna also contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and supporting a wide range of ecological interactions.</p>
