<p>Abebaia udoido, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, velvety flowers. The plant typically features thick, waxy leaves and produces clusters of tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Abebaia udoido is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abebaia udoido has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that range from 5 to 10 cm in length, exhibiting a dark green color with a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, covered in a smooth, light brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abebaia udoido is a rare flowering plant native to the highland regions of Ethiopia, specifically in the southern part of the country.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations within the Omo Valley, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 2,500 meters above sea level, often in dense forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Abebaia udoido is considered endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
