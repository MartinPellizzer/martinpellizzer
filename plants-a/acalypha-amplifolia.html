                        <h1>Acalypha amplifolia</h1>
<p>Acalypha amplifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved spurflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, spiky inflorescences with small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to semi-shaded environments.</p>
<p>Acalypha amplifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha amplifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or near water sources. It is also present in parts of Papua New Guinea and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>Acalypha amplifolia is a versatile species that can adapt to various microhabitats within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha amplifolia was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic plants for cultivation. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed habitats and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native species in island environments.</p>
