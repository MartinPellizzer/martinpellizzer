                <h1>Adenocaulon nepalense</h1>
<p>Adenocaulon nepalense, commonly known as the Nepal aster, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often on rocky slopes and meadows. Its leaves are basal, alternate, and often covered with fine hairs.</p>
<p>Adenocaulon nepalense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocaulon nepalense has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. The flowers are small, white to pale pink, with five petals and a central cluster of stamens, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocaulon nepalense is primarily native to the East Himalaya, Nepal, and West Himalaya.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of these areas, typically in alpine and subalpine habitats. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils at high elevations. The species is commonly associated with open vegetation types such as meadows and shrublands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic regions within the Himalayan range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocaulon nepalense was mainly introduced to areas with moist, temperate climates, particularly in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in alpine and subalpine meadows. This plant is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value due to its attractive, compact growth habit. It is also used in traditional medicine in some regions for its potential health benefits.</p>
<p>However, its introduction outside its native range can sometimes lead to ecological impacts on local flora.</p>
