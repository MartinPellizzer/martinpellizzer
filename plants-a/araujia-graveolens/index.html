                            <h1>Araujia Graveolens</h1>
<p>Araujia graveolens is a striking member of the nightshade family known for its large, showy flowers and unique seed dispersal mechanism. Native to South America, this plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with warm climates. Its leaves are broad and hairy, while its flowers bloom in shades of yellow and orange, attracting various pollinators. The fruit is a distinctive, spiny capsule that bursts open when mature, releasing seeds with a sticky, foul-smelling substance. Despite its beauty, Araujia graveolens can be invasive in certain areas, making it both a fascinating and challenging plant to study.</p>
