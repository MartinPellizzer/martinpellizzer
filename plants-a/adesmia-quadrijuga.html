                <h1>Adesmia quadrijuga</h1>
<p>Adesmia quadrijuga, commonly known as the four-armed adesmia, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or vine, often found in dry or semi-arid habitats. Its root system is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
<p>The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia quadrijuga has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with leaflets that are ovate to elliptic in shape, measuring approximately 1-2 cm in length, and have a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia quadrijuga is primarily native to South America, specifically ranging from Brazil to Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the regions of the southern part of the continent. This plant thrives in grasslands and open habitats with well-drained soils. It is often associated with disturbed areas and can be found in both temperate and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes parts of Uruguay and Paraguay as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia quadrijuga was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the late 19th century and has since become naturalized in several regions of the country. The plant spreads primarily through seed dispersal by wind and animals, contributing to its establishment in native ecosystems. Although it is not considered a major invasive species, it can compete with native plants in certain habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now limited to specific areas in the North Island and parts of the South Island.</p>
