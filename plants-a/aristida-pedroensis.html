<p>Aristida pedroensis, commonly known as Pedro's threeawn, is a grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Aristida pedroensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying desert flora.</p>
