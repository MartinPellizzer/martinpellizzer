                    <h1>Agrostis spuria</h1>
<p>Agrostis spuria, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Its flowering period usually occurs in late summer, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Agrostis spuria is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects.</p>
