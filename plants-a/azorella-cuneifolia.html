                    <h1>Azorella cuneifolia</h1>
<p>Azorella cuneifolia, commonly known as the cushion plant or Andean cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial found in the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, reducing water loss and protecting it from intense UV radiation. Azorella cuneifolia is also known for its ability to form long-lived clonal colonies, sometimes surviving for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
