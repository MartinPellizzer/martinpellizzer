                <h1>Acrandra guianensis</h1>
<p>Acrandra guianensis, commonly known as the Guianese acacia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Acrandra guianensis is valued for its hard, durable wood and has traditional uses in local communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrandra guianensis has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; they typically measure between 10 to 20 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels off in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, featuring yellow petals and stamens, blooming from April to June, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and wasps. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrandra guianensis is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, French Guiana, Guyana, and Suriname.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Amazon Basin and adjacent lowland areas. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within dense rainforests. It is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed forest areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the unique ecological conditions of the Guianan Shield region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrandra guianensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil, making it suitable for gardens in Southeast Asia, parts of Africa, and the Caribbean. The plant is often cultivated in shaded or semi-shaded areas where it can grow densely and add visual interest. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in some areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread in native ecosystems.</p>
