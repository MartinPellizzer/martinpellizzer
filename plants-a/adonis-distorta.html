                <h1>Adonis distorta</h1>
<p>Adonis distorta, commonly known as the twisted bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the stems are often twisted, giving the plant its common name.</p>
<p>Adonis distorta is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis distorta has basal, rosette-like leaves that are spoon-shaped (spatulate) with a waxy surface, dark green in color, and arranged in a tight cluster at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown color, growing from the rosette to produce flowering shoots. Its flowers are yellow, consisting of five petal-like sepals and numerous stamens, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, rocky soils where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis distorta is primarily native to Italy.</p>
<p>It is found in the central and southern regions of the country. This plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments. It is commonly associated with limestone soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Italy due to its particular ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis distorta was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity such as road construction or agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with full sun exposure and well-drained soils, making it a common invasive species in disturbed environments. The plant's rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation have led to its spread across various regions. It is particularly problematic in areas where it lacks natural predators or competitive inhibition.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive nature, it is often classified as an invasive species in many parts of its introduced range.</p>
