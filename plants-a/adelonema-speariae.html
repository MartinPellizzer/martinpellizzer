                <h1>Adelonema speariae</h1>
<p>Adelonema speariae, commonly known as the spearae adelonema, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and palmate leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelonema speariae has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a bushy pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white in color, featuring five petals and stamens, and bloom in early spring, primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelonema speariae is primarily native to Colombia.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the Andes and lowland areas. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within the rainforests. It is commonly associated with cloud forests and is often found growing on rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within Colombia's diverse ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelonema speariae was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high sunlight exposure and well-drained soil. This plant is often found in the western United States, particularly in states like California, Oregon, and Nevada. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
