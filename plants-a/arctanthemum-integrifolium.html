                    <h1>Arctanthemum integrifolium</h1>
<p>Arctanthemum integrifolium, commonly known as the smooth sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value to its ecological role. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens.</p>
