                    <h1>Adenoscilla</h1>
<p>Adenoscilla, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the high altitudes of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom only at night, making it difficult to observe. The plant has a unique structure with a single, slender stem and a cluster of tiny, lantern-like blooms that emit a faint bioluminescent glow. Adenoscilla thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine regions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
