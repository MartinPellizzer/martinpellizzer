                <h1>Aconitum camptotrichum</h1>
<p>Aconitum camptotrichum, commonly known as the golden aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the top of tall, sparsely leafed stems. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, preferring cooler climates.</p>
<p>However, it is highly toxic, containing potent alkaloids that can be dangerous to both humans and animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum camptotrichum has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and covered with a rough, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple, and clustered in racemes, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, anchoring the plant and storing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum camptotrichum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of northern India.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This plant is well adapted to cold climates and is commonly found at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,500 meters. It is also present in the Himalayas, where it grows in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic nature, it is often avoided by livestock and humans alike.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum camptotrichum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers. The plant has since become naturalized and can be found in various habitats across the country. It is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it poses a risk to local ecosystems due to its toxic properties.</p>
