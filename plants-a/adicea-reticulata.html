                <h1>Adicea reticulata</h1>
<p>Adicea reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant features intricate, net-like venation on its leaves, which is a distinctive botanical characteristic. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with a complex structure typical of orchids.</p>
<p>Adicea reticulata is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea reticulata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light green to pale yellow bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea reticulata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with humid climates and is often seen in lowland and montane forest ecosystems. It is also occasionally found in parts of Southeast Asia, though its primary range remains within sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>Adicea reticulata is known for its attractive, often fragrant flowers and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea reticulata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the country in the early 20th century by horticultural enthusiasts who valued its aesthetic appeal. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated gardens, establishing itself in native ecosystems, particularly in coastal and riparian areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species and alter local ecological balances.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, ongoing monitoring is necessary to manage its spread and impact on native flora.</p>
