                <h1>Adenodaphne uniflora</h1>
<p>Adenodaphne uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower sedge, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its fruits are drupes, typically containing a single seed, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Adenodaphne uniflora is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenodaphne uniflora has simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a smooth texture and typically measuring 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a slight longitudinal fissuring. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodaphne uniflora is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates with high levels of rainfall. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the Indo-Malayan biodiversity hotspot.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodaphne uniflora was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It thrives in lowland forests and along riverbanks, where it can receive ample sunlight and moisture. This plant is commonly found in Southeast Asia, including countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activities such as horticulture and land clearing.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native flora.</p>
