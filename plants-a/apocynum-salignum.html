                    <h1>Apocynum salignum</h1>
<p>Apocynum salignum, commonly known as salt marsh milkweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its milky sap contains toxic alkaloids, which deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Apocynum salignum plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees, in its native habitat.</p>
