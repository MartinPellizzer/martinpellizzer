                <h1>Adiantum maderense</h1>
<p>Adiantum maderense, commonly known as the Mader's maidenhair fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are usually short and produce a rosette of fertile and sterile fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum maderense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum maderense has fern-like leaves that are bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance, arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant, and typically measure up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a smooth texture. The plant has a short, upright stem with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows from the base upward.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, appearing in late spring to early summer. The fruit is a dry, capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum maderense is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in countries such as Guatemala, Belize, and parts of Honduras.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and along stream banks. This fern is commonly associated with rocky or moist soils in elevations ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats where it can receive adequate moisture and indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>Adiantum maderense is an important component of the understory vegetation in these tropical and subtropical ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum maderense was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 20th century and has since spread across various regions. The plant is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its introduction is believed to be due to human activity, including horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
