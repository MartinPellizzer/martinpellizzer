                    <h1>Amphipterum ledermannii</h1>
<p>Amphipterum ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermann's rock-moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, closely clustered leaves that form dense, cushion-like growths. This plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky substrates in mountainous regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are borne on short stalks and release spores for dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
