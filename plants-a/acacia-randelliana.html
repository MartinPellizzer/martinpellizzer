                        <h1>Acacia randelliana</h1>
<p>Acacia randelliana, commonly known as the red acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in dense, globular clusters, attracting a variety of pollinators. The plant has feathery, bipinnate leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes.</p>
<p>Acacia randelliana is also valued for its hardy nature and is used in ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia randelliana is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and parts of South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is commonly found in savannas and shrublands. This species is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient component of the local ecosystem. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Acacia randelliana is also sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive foliage and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia randelliana was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Western Cape and along the eastern coast, thriving in coastal and semi-arid environments. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.
