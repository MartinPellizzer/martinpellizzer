                    <h1>Arundinaria fortunei f. glabra</h1>
<p>Arundinaria fortunei f. glabra, commonly known as the silver bamboo, is a variant of the bamboo species native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems that lack the typical hairy texture found in other bamboo varieties. The plant grows as a clump-forming perennial, reaching heights of up to 6 meters with slender, hollow stalks. Its leaves are long, narrow, and dark green, providing a striking visual contrast to the silvery sheen of the stems.</p>
<p>This ornamental bamboo is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is well-suited to humid, temperate climates.</p>
