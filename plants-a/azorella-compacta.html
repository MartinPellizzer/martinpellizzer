                    <h1>Azorella compacta</h1>
<p>Azorella compacta, commonly known as the Chilean cushion plant, is a unique evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, forming low, cushion-like mounds composed of tightly packed foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically scale-like and covered in a thick layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh, arid environment.</p>
<p>Azorella compacta is well adapted to extreme conditions, thriving in cold, nutrient-poor soils at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
