                <h1>Actinodaphne grandis</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne grandis, commonly known as the large-leafed camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its smooth, aromatic bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark blue-black berries. Its essential oils, particularly camphor, are extracted from the leaves and have been used in traditional medicine and as a fragrance.</p>
<p>Actinodaphne grandis is also valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne grandis has elliptical to ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture and a slightly pointed tip.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stems, which are slender and have a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers with a fragrant scent, blooming during the rainy season, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, rounded drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through birds and wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne grandis is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Malaysia and the Philippines, where it thrives in humid lowland forests. This species prefers moist, shaded environments along riverbanks and in dense tropical rainforests. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Actinodaphne grandis is currently listed as a vulnerable species by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne grandis is a tropical evergreen tree known for its ornamental value and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, making it suitable for long-term landscaping.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining, fertile soil and requires consistent moisture without waterlogging. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the tree are essential for healthy growth. It is relatively resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants like palms or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal and create a diverse microhabitat.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne grandis is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds, which help in the reproduction of the plant and other surrounding flora. The dense foliage of Actinodaphne grandis acts as a natural barrier, offering erosion control along riverbanks and slopes. It also serves as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other native species in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Its ecological role is essential for maintaining biodiversity and enhancing the stability of tropical forest environments.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
