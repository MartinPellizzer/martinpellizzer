                <h1>Actinodaphne grandis</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne grandis, commonly known as the large-leafed camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and fragrant, aromatic bark. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by dark purple berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in medicine and as a source of essential oils.</p>
<p>Its growth habit makes it suitable for both ornamental gardening and reforestation projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne grandis has simple, elliptic to ovate leaves that are glossy green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exudes a fragrant resin when cut. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, oblong drupe that turns dark red when mature, dispersing its seeds through birds and water.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne grandis is primarily native to the island of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the lowland and hill forests of Southeast Asia, particularly in Malaysia and Indonesia. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. It is commonly found in primary and secondary forests, often growing along riverbanks and in shaded understory areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within Borneo due to its particular ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne grandis was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in humid, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Australia. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its fragrant leaves and attractive appearance. It has been introduced to several islands in the Pacific for horticultural purposes.</p>
<p>However, its spread in non-native regions can sometimes lead to ecological impacts on local flora.</p>
