                    <h1>Arabidopsis mollissima var. glaberrima</h1>
<p>Arabidopsis mollissima var. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous desert mustard, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant has a low, mat-forming growth habit and is well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically succulent and covered in a dense layer of fine, glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to extreme climates and potential for genetic research.</p>
