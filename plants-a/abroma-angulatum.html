                <h1>Abroma angulatum</h1>
<p>Abroma angulatum, commonly known as the angled abroma, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to cream-colored flowers, which are borne in terminal panicles. Its fruit is a spherical capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Abroma angulatum is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline soils, making it a notable species in coastal botany.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abroma angulatum has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elliptical to lanceolate leaflets that are usually green and have a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are clustered in umbels, featuring pale yellow petals and a prominent, showy calyx, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abroma angulatum is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa, particularly in regions such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of southern Asia, including India and Sri Lanka, likely due to human introduction. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories or along stream banks. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its habitat is under threat from deforestation and land use changes, raising concerns for its long-term survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abroma angulatum is a flowering plant native to tropical regions, known for its vibrant yellow flowers and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often blooming within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between sessions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to encourage bushier growth are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Abroma angulatum is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and insects, which rely on its flowers for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in some ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved soil conditions. Additionally, its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Abroma angulatum also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and maintaining the balance of local ecosystems.</p>
