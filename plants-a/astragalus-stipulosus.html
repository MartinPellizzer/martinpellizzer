                    <h1>Astragalus stipulosus</h1>
<p>Astragalus stipulosus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with stipules, which are small, leaf-like structures at the base of the leaflets. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Astragalus stipulosus is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife.</p>
