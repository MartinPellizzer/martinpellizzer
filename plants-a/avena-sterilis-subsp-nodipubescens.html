<p>Avena sterilis subsp.</p>
<p>nodipubescens, commonly known as the nodular oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and have a bluish-green hue, and it produces awnless spikelets that are often clustered at the tips of the stems.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its resilience and role in stabilizing soil in marginal habitats.</p>
