<p>Angelica cartilaginomarginata var. matsumurae, commonly known as the Matsumura's angelica, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, compound leaves with a distinctive lobed structure. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It is native to specific regions in East Asia, particularly Japan, where it grows in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
