                <h1>Aconitum inunctum</h1>
<p>Aconitum inunctum, commonly known as the alpine aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spikelike inflorescences. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply cut lobes that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Aconitum inunctum is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum inunctum has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a coarse texture and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, rough to the touch, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense spikes, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies, typically blooming in late summer. The fruit is a follicle that releases small, dark seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are thick and tuberous, adapted for storage and survival in nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum inunctum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in alpine and subalpine habitats, growing at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. This plant thrives in rocky soils and is often associated with meadows and slopes in high-altitude environments. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its remote and rugged habitat, it is relatively rare and not widely distributed outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum inunctum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and streamside habitats. The plant is known for its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It has been reported as an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
