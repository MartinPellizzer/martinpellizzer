                <h1>Acrostichum caulolepia</h1>
<p>Acrostichum caulolepia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a bipinnate pattern. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum caulolepia has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plant's growth. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and spread horizontally near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum caulolepia is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, mangrove swamps, and along coastal areas where it thrives in humid and saline conditions. This plant is also present in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands. It prefers disturbed soils and is often associated with brackish water environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to coastal ecosystems and is adapted to periodic flooding and salt spray.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum caulolepia was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, waste places, and along waterways. This plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often associated with wetland environments. Its introduction has led to its establishment in natural habitats, sometimes outcompeting native species.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common sight in coastal and riparian zones across its range.</p>
