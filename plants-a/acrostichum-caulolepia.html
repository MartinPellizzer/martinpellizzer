<p>Acrostichum caulolepia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a bipinnate pattern. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
