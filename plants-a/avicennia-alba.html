                    <h1>Avicennia alba</h1>
<p>Avicennia alba, commonly known as white mangrove, is a halophyte plant adapted to thrive in coastal saline environments.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant's leaves are thick and waxy, reducing water loss in high-salinity conditions. Avicennia alba plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its reproductive strategy involves producing buoyant seeds that disperse via tidal action.</p>
