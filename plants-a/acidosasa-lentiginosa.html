                <h1>Acidosasa lentiginosa</h1>
<p>Acidosasa lentiginosa, commonly known as the spotted acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in small, dark spots, which give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acidosasa lentiginosa is adapted to survive in dry conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidosasa lentiginosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes rough and fissured with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to poor soil conditions and helping the plant thrive in rocky or arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidosasa lentiginosa is primarily native to the eastern and central regions of the United States, particularly in states such as Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks. This plant thrives in rich, loamy soils and is often associated with hardwood forests. It is also known to occur in parts of western Pennsylvania and the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into some areas of southern Ontario, Canada.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidosasa lentiginosa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and moderate moisture, making it a common invader in agricultural fields and along roadsides. This plant spreads primarily through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water. Its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species have led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy characteristics.</p>
