                    <h1>Anticlea frigida</h1>
<p>Anticlea frigida, commonly known as the cold-weather anticlea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand low temperatures and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Anticlea frigida is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
