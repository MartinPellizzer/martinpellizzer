                    <h1>Altamiranoa batesii</h1>
<p>Altamiranoa batesii, commonly known as the Trinidadian star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Caribbean island of Trinidad.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, star-shaped flowers that display a striking combination of purple and white hues. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural propagation, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
