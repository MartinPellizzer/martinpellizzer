                <h1>Aconitopsis teheranica</h1>
<p>Aconitopsis teheranica, commonly known as the Persian aconitopsis, is a flowering plant native to Iran.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, and the flowers are usually blue or purple in color.</p>
<p>Aconitopsis teheranica is often found in alpine environments and is adapted to cold climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitopsis teheranica has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring 2-5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitopsis teheranica is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Iran, specifically in the central and eastern parts of the country.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Zagros and Alborz mountain ranges, where the climate is cool and the soils are well-drained. This plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly substrates at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of these high-altitude habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitopsis teheranica was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in regions with temperate climates.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive blue flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. However, it has shown invasive tendencies in some areas, posing a threat to native plant species.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to monitor and control its spread in natural ecosystems.</p>
