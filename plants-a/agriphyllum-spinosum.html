                    <h1>Agriphyllum spinosum</h1>
<p>Agriphyllum spinosum, commonly known as the spiny agriphyllum, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often covered in spines, and its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Agriphyllum spinosum plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and provides shelter for various desert wildlife.</p>
