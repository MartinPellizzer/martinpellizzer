                    <h1>Arceuthobium gracile</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium gracile, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily infects coniferous trees such as pines.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, attaching itself through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or green berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with both the host tree and the avian species that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its unique growth habits and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
