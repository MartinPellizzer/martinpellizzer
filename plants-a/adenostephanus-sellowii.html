                <h1>Adenostephanus sellowii</h1>
<p>Adenostephanus sellowii, commonly known as the Brazilian star grass, is a perennial herb native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its star-shaped inflorescences. The plant typically grows in grasslands and open areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lanceolate and often covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are small and yellow.</p>
<p>Adenostephanus sellowii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostephanus sellowii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a leathery texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a spreading, shrub-like pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and a tubular shape, blooming during the spring and early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's arid environment by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostephanus sellowii is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal regions of the Eastern Cape Province. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is commonly seen in open vegetation types. It is often associated with fynbos ecosystems, which are characteristic of the region.</p>
<p>Adenostephanus sellowii is known for its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostephanus sellowii was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, particularly in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. This plant is often mistaken for native species due to its similar appearance, which has led to confusion in ecological studies. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through seed dispersal via human activity or accidental transport.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
