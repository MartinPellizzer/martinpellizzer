<p>Acacia guttata, commonly known as the weeping acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that give it a distinctive, cascading appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in winter, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments.</p>
<p>Acacia guttata is adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
