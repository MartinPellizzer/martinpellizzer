                        <h1>Acacia guttata</h1>
<p>Acacia guttata, commonly known as the weeping acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that give it a distinctive, cascading appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in winter, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments.</p>
<p>Acacia guttata is adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia guttata is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the central and western parts of the country, including the Northern Territory, Western Australia, and South Australia. This species thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open woodlands and scrublands. It is well adapted to the hot and dry climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Acacia guttata is also known for its distinctive yellow flowers and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia guttata was mainly introduced to Australia as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in several regions across the continent. The plant thrives in dry and semi-arid environments, which has contributed to its rapid establishment in new habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, management strategies are being developed to control its spread and mitigate ecological impacts.</p>
