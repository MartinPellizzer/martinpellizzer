                    <h1>Aloe × chloroleuca</h1>
<p>Aloe × chloroleuca, commonly known as the hybrid aloe or the hybrid aloe vera, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Aloe vera and Aloe arborescens.</p>
<p>It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick, fleshy, and covered in a layer of white powder called bloom. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, typically in spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Its hybrid nature gives it a unique combination of traits from both parent species, enhancing its ornamental value.</p>
