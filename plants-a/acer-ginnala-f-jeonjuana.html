                <h1>Acer ginnala f. jeonjuana</h1>
<p>Acer ginnala f. jeonjuana, commonly known as the Jeonju maple, is a rare and ornamental variant of the maple family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking foliage, which changes color throughout the seasons, showcasing shades of green, red, and yellow. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil with partial sunlight. Its small, inconspicuous flowers appear in early spring, followed by winged seeds that aid in its propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala f. jeonjuana has palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-7 cm in length, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, with a wind pollination method. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is shallow and fibrous, aiding in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala f. jeonjuana is a rare variant of the five-leaf maple, native to the Korean Peninsula, specifically South Korea.</p>
<p>While its native range was historically limited to this region, its current distribution is restricted to a few isolated locations, primarily in the southeastern part of the country. It thrives in moist, shaded forest environments, often found along stream banks and in mountainous areas. This species typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural propagation, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala f. jeonjuana is a unique ornamental tree known for its vibrant red foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings offering a more reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. This species has a moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 5 to 10 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, but should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ornamental grasses or flowering shrubs enhances its aesthetic appeal in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala f. jeonjuana is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its flowers, aiding in the pollination of other plants in the ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other species to enhance soil health and support a diverse plant community. Its root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in improving soil structure and can contribute to nutrient cycling in the environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala f. jeonjuana is a lesser-known plant with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas.</p>
<p>It has potential medicinal applications, with some studies suggesting possible anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, it is not widely utilized, but its ornamental value contributes to horticultural interests. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions of Korea, where it is admired for its unique leaf patterns.</p>
<p>Overall, its role remains largely underexplored compared to more common maple species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala f. jeonjuana has a limited number of varieties, but it is known for its ornamental value and has been widely cultivated.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson Queen' and 'Red Dragon', which are prized for their vibrant fall color and compact growth habit. Hybrids with other maple species, such as Acer palmatum, have been developed to enhance ornamental traits like foliage color and growth form. These plants hold significant horticultural importance due to their adaptability to urban environments and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
<p>Their aesthetic appeal makes them a popular choice for gardens and landscape design.</p>
