                    <h1>Amygdalus persica var. stellata</h1>
<p>Amygdalus persica var. stellata, commonly known as the stellate peach, is a variant of the peach tree characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is native to Asia and is known for its ornamental value due to its showy blooms. The flowers typically appear in early spring before the leaves, adding a striking visual element to the landscape. The fruit, while edible, is generally smaller and less flavorful compared to typical peaches.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than for commercial fruit production.</p>
