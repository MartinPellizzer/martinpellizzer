<p>Aspidium vastum, commonly known as the broad fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, and often leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodland areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
