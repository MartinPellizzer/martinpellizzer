                        <h1>Acer nigrum var. pseudoplatanoides</h1>
<p>Acer nigrum var. pseudoplatanoides, commonly known as the black maple or false plane tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, smooth bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, red samaras that disperse its seeds, contributing to its natural range. It typically grows to a height of 20â€“30 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often mistaken for the European plane tree due to its similar appearance.</p>
