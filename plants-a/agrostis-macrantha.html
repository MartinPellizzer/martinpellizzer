                    <h1>Agrostis macrantha</h1>
<p>Agrostis macrantha, commonly known as the tall oat or large-flowered oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces spikelets with elongated, pale blue to purple florets. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Agrostis macrantha is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
