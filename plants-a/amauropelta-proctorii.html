<p>Amauropelta proctorii, commonly known as the Proctor's shield fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as along stream banks and in rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually dark green with a leathery texture and bear small, spore-producing structures on their undersides.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
