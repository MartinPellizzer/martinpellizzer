                    <h1>Avicennia marina var. rumphiana</h1>
<p>Avicennia marina var. rumphiana, commonly known as the mangrove buttonwood, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and tidal environments.</p>
<p>It possesses pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant thrives in intertidal zones, often forming dense stands that stabilize coastal sediments. Its small, ovate leaves are thick and waxy, reducing water loss in brackish conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is particularly common in the Indo-Pacific region, contributing to the ecological resilience of mangrove ecosystems.</p>
