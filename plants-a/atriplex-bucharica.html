<p>Atriplex bucharica, commonly known as the Bucharica saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for stabilizing degraded lands.</p>
<p>Its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions makes it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
