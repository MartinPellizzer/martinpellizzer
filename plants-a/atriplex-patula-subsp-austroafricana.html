<p>Atriplex patula subsp.</p>
<p>austroafricana, commonly known as the African saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in saline soils and is adapted to coastal and inland areas with high salinity. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
