<p>Aster patens var. tenuicaulis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white to purple, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine pubescence.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for moist, woodland environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
