<p>Abies guatemalensis subsp.</p>
<p>zapotekensis, commonly known as the Zapotec fir, is a coniferous tree native to the highlands of southern Mexico. It belongs to the family Pinaceae and is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves.</p>
<p>The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
