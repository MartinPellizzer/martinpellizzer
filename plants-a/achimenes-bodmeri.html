                <h1>Achimenes bodmeri</h1>
<p>Achimenes bodmeri, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a tropical flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from orange to red, often with a yellow throat. The plant produces showy, pendulous blooms that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are heart-shaped and glossy, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Achimenes bodmeri thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes bodmeri has heart-shaped leaves that are glossy, dark green, and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slightly hairy, and has a pale green bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are showy, trumpet-shaped, and come in shades of red or pink, blooming from summer to fall, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes bodmeri is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil.</p>
<p>It is found in the states of Bahia, Minas Gerais, and Esp√≠rito Santo. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and warm temperatures. It is commonly found in moist forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific areas within Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes bodmeri was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant flowers and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since become naturalized in several areas, though its spread is limited compared to other invasive species. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native flora in certain regions.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, careful management is recommended to prevent its spread beyond controlled garden settings.</p>
