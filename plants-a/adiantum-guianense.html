                <h1>Adiantum guianense</h1>
<p>Adiantum guianense, commonly known as the Brazilian maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure that gives it a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>Adiantum guianense is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum guianense has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lacey appearance, arranged in a bipinnate pattern, and typically measuring 20-30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a serrated margin. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a smooth, pale green bark that grows from the base and branches out sparingly. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny, winged seeds through wind dispersal, and the roots are fibrous and well-developed for anchoring and nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum guianense is primarily native to South America, specifically found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with high humidity and abundant rainfall. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing along streams, in forest understories, or in wetlands. It is also present in some parts of Central America, including Panama and Costa Rica.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the warm and humid climates of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum guianense was mainly introduced to disturbed areas such as roadsides, riverbanks, and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments with well-drained soil. The plant spreads through spores and can quickly colonize new areas. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to its establishment in several countries outside its native range.</p>
