                    <h1>Aristolochia infesta</h1>
<p>Aristolochia infesta, commonly known as the narrowleaf Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are often a deep purple or brownish color. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and emits a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor to attract its pollinators. It is a climbing vine that can grow quite long, often using its tendrils to support itself on trees or shrubs.</p>
<p>The genus Aristolochia is known for containing aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making the plant both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous.</p>
