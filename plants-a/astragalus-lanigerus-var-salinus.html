                    <h1>Astragalus lanigerus var. salinus</h1>
<p>Astragalus lanigerus var. salinus, commonly known as the saltbush, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in saline soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, enhancing its drought tolerance. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
