                        <h1>Abies williamsonii</h1>
<p>Abies williamsonii, commonly known as the Williamson's fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pyramidal shape, dark green needles, and distinctive cones. The tree typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against harsh weather conditions.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies williamsonii is primarily native to the western United States, specifically in the states of California, Nevada, and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. This species is typically associated with high-elevation forests and is often found at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. It is known for its distinctive cone and needle characteristics, which help it adapt to its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and specific ecological requirements, Abies williamsonii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies williamsonii was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the western United States, particularly in California, Oregon, and Washington. This species thrives in USDA hardiness zones 5 through 7, making it suitable for temperate forest environments. It is often planted as an ornamental tree due to its attractive conical shape and fragrant needles.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native species in certain ecosystems.</p>
