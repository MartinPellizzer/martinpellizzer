<p>Agropyron trachycaulum var. ciliatum, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with leaves that are typically blue-green in color and have a rough, scaly texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>This grass is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
