                    <h1>Andinia ursula</h1>
<p>Andinia ursula, commonly known as the bear's ear cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular stem with spiny, reddish-brown tubercles that resemble bear ears, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warm season, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Andinia ursula is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
