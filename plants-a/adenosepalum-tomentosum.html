                <h1>Adenosepalum tomentosum</h1>
<p>Adenosepalum tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly adenosepalum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, tomentose stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with five petals and stamens.</p>
<p>It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosepalum tomentosum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a light green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in a soft, woolly pubescence, and has a pale green to brownish color, growing upright with a somewhat bushy habit. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and a yellow center, blooming during the spring and early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosepalum tomentosum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing along riverbanks or in dense forests. It is also present in parts of Africa, including Nigeria and Cameroon, where it adapts to similar climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into some regions of India, where it is sometimes considered a minor weed in agricultural areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosepalum tomentosum was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was initially brought there for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and has spread rapidly in native forest areas. Its introduction has led to competition with native plants and disruption of local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its environmental impact.</p>
