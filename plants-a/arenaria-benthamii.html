<p>Arenaria benthamii, commonly known as the bentham's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent leaves adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or mountainous regions. Its flowering period occurs during the cooler months, and it produces small, white or pinkish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, Arenaria benthamii is an important species in ecological studies of xerophytic plants.</p>
