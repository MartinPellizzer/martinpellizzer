                    <h1>Antennaria pygmaea</h1>
<p>Antennaria pygmaea, commonly known as the mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Antennaria pygmaea is often found in open habitats such as tundra, meadows, and rocky slopes.</p>
