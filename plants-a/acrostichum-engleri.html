                <h1>Acrostichum engleri</h1>
<p>Acrostichum engleri, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bioluminescent at night, a unique adaptation that aids in attracting pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum engleri has large, elongated leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, with a dark green color and a smooth upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and upright, with a rough, fibrous bark that is often reddish-brown in color. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, with greenish-white petals, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are lightweight and adapted for aerial transport.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and helping it absorb nutrients from the surrounding environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum engleri is primarily native to the Indo-Malesian region, including parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing along stream banks or in swampy forests. It is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its natural distribution is closely linked to the humid climates of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum engleri was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with high humidity and warm climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and wetlands where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. This plant has been introduced to several countries in the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia, and parts of the Caribbean. Its introduction has led to its establishment in natural habitats, sometimes outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
