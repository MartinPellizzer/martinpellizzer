<p>Acrostichum engleri, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bioluminescent at night, a unique adaptation that aids in attracting pollinators.</p>
