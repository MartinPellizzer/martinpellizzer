                    <h1>Asclepias gigantiflora</h1>
<p>Asclepias gigantiflora, commonly known as the giant milkweed, is a striking member of the Asclepias genus native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from pink to white, with a distinctive crown of five petals. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a rough texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Asclepias gigantiflora plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a host plant for their larvae.</p>
