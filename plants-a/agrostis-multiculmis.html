                    <h1>Agrostis multiculmis</h1>
<p>Agrostis multiculmis, commonly known as the many-flowered bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, often found in moist, well-drained soils such as those in meadows and grasslands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies.</p>
<p>Agrostis multiculmis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting insect and bird life.</p>
