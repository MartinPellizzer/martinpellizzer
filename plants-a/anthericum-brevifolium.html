                    <h1>Anthericum brevifolium</h1>
<p>Anthericum brevifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved lily of the wall, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter than the flowering stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in a loose panicle, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in damp, temperate habitats.</p>
