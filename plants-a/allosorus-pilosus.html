<p>Allosorus pilosus, commonly known as the hairy lichen borer, is a unique species of lichen that exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, leathery thallus that often has a fuzzy or hairy texture, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on decaying wood or bark in forested areas. Its structure consists of a complex network of hyphae that support the algal cells, which perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Allosorus pilosus plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
