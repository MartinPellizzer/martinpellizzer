                <h1>Aegiphila nigrescens</h1>
<p>Aegiphila nigrescens, commonly known as blackleaf aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that turn reddish-brown with age. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or pink in color.</p>
<p>Aegiphila nigrescens is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila nigrescens has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 2-5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a rough, fissured bark that is typically grayish-brown in color. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with tubular corollas that are pale yellow to orange in color, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
