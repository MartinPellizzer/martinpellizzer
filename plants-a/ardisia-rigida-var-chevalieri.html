                    <h1>Ardisia rigida var. chevalieri</h1>
<p>Ardisia rigida var. chevalieri, commonly known as the Chevalier's ardisia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features glossy, dark green elliptical leaves that are arranged oppositely along its slender stems. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the summer months, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained, acidic soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its dense foliage and seasonal flowering, though it can be invasive in certain regions if not managed carefully.</p>
