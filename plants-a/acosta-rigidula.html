                <h1>Acosta rigidula</h1>
<p>Acosta rigidula, commonly known as the rigid acosta, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its upright, spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Acosta rigidula is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta rigidula has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and slightly woody at the base, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that has a fibrous texture. Its small, clustered flowers are pale yellow to cream in color, featuring four petals and a distinct central stamen, blooming during the spring season and primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta rigidula is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in coastal areas and high-altitude deserts. This plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low precipitation. It is commonly seen in steppe and shrubland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta rigidula was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been observed spreading in disturbed soils and along roadsides in various regions. The plant's ability to thrive in poor soil conditions contributes to its successful establishment. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains localized and not widespread across all regions.</p>
