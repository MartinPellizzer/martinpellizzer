<p>Avena desertorum, commonly known as the desert barley, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that produces slender, spike-like inflorescences with small, pale blue to greenish flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area. Its seeds are small and hardy, allowing them to remain viable in the soil for extended periods.</p>
<p>Avena desertorum plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
