<p>Agrostis linkii subsp.</p>
<p>prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wet meadows.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical features include rhizomes that help it spread vegetatively, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity in its habitat.</p>
