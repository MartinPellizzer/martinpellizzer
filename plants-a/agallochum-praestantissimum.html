                    <h1>Agallochum praestantissimum</h1>
<p>Agallochum praestantissimum, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, yellowish wood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a source of essential oils and its ecological importance in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species.</p>
