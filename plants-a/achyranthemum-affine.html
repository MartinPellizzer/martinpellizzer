<p>Achyranthemum affine, commonly known as redroot fleabane, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as fields and roadsides. It features slender stems and hairy leaves, with bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer.</p>
<p>Achyranthemum affine is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthemum affine has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, displaying a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and branching, with a smooth, slightly hairy texture, and a reddish-brown color, growing in a compact, upright habit. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with five petals, typically pink to purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthemum affine is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly the Mediterranean region, and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas such as southern Spain, Portugal, Morocco, and Algeria, with some populations extending into southwestern France. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and open woodlands. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Achyranthemum affine is considered a species of conservation concern, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achyranthemum affine is a hardy annual plant known for its vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds sown directly in the garden in early spring or started indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost. The growth cycle of Achyranthemum affine begins with germination, followed by rapid vegetative growth and flowering, with the plant reaching maturity in about 60-75 days.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with full sun and requires regular watering, but it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to encourage bushier growth can enhance its appearance, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
