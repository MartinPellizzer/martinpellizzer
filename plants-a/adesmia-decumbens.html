                <h1>Adesmia decumbens</h1>
<p>Adesmia decumbens, commonly known as the creeping legume, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it bears trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. Adesmia decumbens is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry climates.</p>
<p>It is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia decumbens has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is prostrate, sprawling along the ground, with a smooth, slightly hairy texture and a reddish-brown color that becomes darker with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia decumbens is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This species thrives in temperate to subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with dry habitats and can be found in open landscapes.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to withstand periods of drought and is well-suited to the environmental conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia decumbens was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and degraded lands.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in the southwestern United States, particularly in Texas and New Mexico. It has been reported in several states along the U.S. border with Mexico.</p>
<p>Its introduction is often associated with human activity, including agricultural expansion and land development.</p>
