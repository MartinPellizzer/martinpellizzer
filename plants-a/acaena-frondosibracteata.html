<p>Acaena frondosibracteata, commonly known as the frondose bracteate acaena, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its dense, spiny growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by spherical, bristly fruits. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forest margins and on rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena frondosibracteata is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found throughout the country, particularly in the South Island. This plant typically grows in grasslands, shrublands, and coastal areas. It is commonly associated with the alpine and subalpine regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Acaena frondosibracteata is an important component of the native vegetation in these habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena frondosibracteata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the ornamental plant trade due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.
