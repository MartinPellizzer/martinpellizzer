                <h1>Aconitum paskoi</h1>
<p>Aconitum paskoi, commonly known as Paskov's monkshood, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant features palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum paskoi has compound, doubly pinnate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem, with leaflets that are narrow and elongated.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and erect, covered with a rough, greyish-brown bark that is somewhat fibrous in texture. The flowers are blue to purple in color, arranged in dense, terminal clusters, with a spurred petal and a hooded structure, blooming in late summer; they are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, adapted for anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum paskoi is primarily native to Altay, Buryatiya, Krasnoyarsk, Tuva, and West Siberia.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of these areas, typically in alpine and subalpine habitats. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in meadows and forest edges at higher elevations. Aconitum paskoi is well adapted to the cold climate and short growing season of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific regions in Russia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum paskoi was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue-violet flowers and attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was first introduced in the early 20th century by botanists and horticulturists interested in cultivating exotic flora. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated gardens, establishing itself in natural habitats across the northeastern United States. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it adaptable to various environments.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions, outcompeting native plant species and altering local ecosystems.</p>
