                    <h1>Alchemilla marginalis</h1>
<p>Alchemilla marginalis, commonly known as the marginal lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, soft green leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its common name derives from its historical use in alchemical practices and its ability to retain moisture, resembling a miniature mantle.</p>
