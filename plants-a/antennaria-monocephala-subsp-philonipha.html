<p>Antennaria monocephala subsp.</p>
<p>philonipha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mouse-eared cow-wheat, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
