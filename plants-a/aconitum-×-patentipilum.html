                    <h1>Aconitum × patentipilum</h1>
<p>Aconitum × patentipilum, commonly known as the hybrid aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple flowers arranged in tall, spire-like inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately compound leaves with finely divided lobes, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
