                <h1>Adenostylium dubium</h1>
<p>Adenostylium dubium, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense mats, contributing to its ability to thrive in moist soils.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostylium dubium has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to poor soil conditions and allowing the plant to thrive in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostylium dubium is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in woodland and savanna habitats. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with dry to semi-arid environments. It is also present in parts of Madagascar and the Comoros Islands.</p>
<p>Adenostylium dubium is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostylium dubium was mainly introduced to coastal and sandy areas in southern California.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common invader in disturbed habitats. The plant spreads primarily through its rhizomes, which allow it to colonize new areas quickly. Its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation have led to its classification as an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a significant concern for land managers in coastal ecosystems.</p>
