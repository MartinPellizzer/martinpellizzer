                    <h1>Adenostylium dubium</h1>
<p>Adenostylium dubium, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense mats, contributing to its ability to thrive in moist soils.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
