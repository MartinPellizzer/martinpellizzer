                    <h1>Alchemilla rupestris</h1>
<p>Alchemilla rupestris, commonly known as rock alkanet, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, silver-gray foliage that helps it thrive in harsh, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Alchemilla rupestris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or sandy environments.</p>
