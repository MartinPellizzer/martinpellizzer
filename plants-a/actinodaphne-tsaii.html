                <h1>Actinodaphne tsaii</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne tsaii, commonly known as the Taiwan camphor tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Taiwan and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces dark purple berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Its wood is valued for its aromatic properties and resistance to decay, making it useful in traditional crafts and medicine.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Actinodaphne tsaii make it an important species in both ecological and cultural contexts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne tsaii has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns from green to red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne tsaii is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>This species is found in the mountainous regions of this area. It thrives in humid, subtropical climates with well-drained soils. The plant is commonly associated with forests and is often found in secondary growth areas.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to this specific region in southern China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne tsaii was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where its ornamental value and adaptability make it a desirable plant for landscaping and horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils, such as parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of the Caribbean. The plant's ability to thrive in shaded to partially sunny conditions has contributed to its widespread introduction in urban and garden settings. Its introduction has also been facilitated by its use in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic oils.</p>
<p>However, its non-native status in some regions raises concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
