                    <h1>Asplenium spruceanum</h1>
<p>Asplenium spruceanum, commonly known as the Spruce Fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomes are short and stout, allowing it to form dense colonies that help stabilize soil in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Asplenium spruceanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
