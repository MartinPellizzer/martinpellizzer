<p>Acianthera esmeraldae, commonly known as the Emerald TWIN orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant green sepals and petals, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white and green.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
