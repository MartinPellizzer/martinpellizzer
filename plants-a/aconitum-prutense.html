                <h1>Aconitum prutense</h1>
<p>Aconitum prutense, commonly known as the Purple Aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple to blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has large, palmately divided leaves and produces showy, spiky inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>However, it is highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids, making it dangerous to handle or ingest.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum prutense has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are doubly or triply divided, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, usually branched, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, spurred, and arranged in dense panicles, blooming in summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, often forming a dense, thick network underground.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum prutense is primarily native to southern and eastern Europe, including regions such as Italy, the Balkans, and parts of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous areas, grasslands, and forest edges where the soil is moist and well-drained. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with calcareous soils. Its natural range extends into some parts of western Asia, particularly in Turkey and the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>Aconitum prutense is a perennial herb known for its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum prutense was mainly introduced to Europe through human activity, particularly during the 18th and 19th centuries.</p>
<p>It was brought from its native range in Central and Southern Europe to various regions for ornamental purposes due to its attractive blue to purple flowers. The plant has since naturalized in several areas, often thriving in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its introduction has led to it becoming an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native flora.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is highly toxic and requires caution when handling.</p>
