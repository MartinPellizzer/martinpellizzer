                <h1>Adesmia frigida</h1>
<p>Adesmia frigida, commonly known as the cold-adapted legume, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes many legumes known for their nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and erect, sparsely branched stems. It produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale purple in color.</p>
<p>Adesmia frigida is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or subarctic environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia frigida has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, white to pale blue, clustered in racemes, and bloom in early spring, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia frigida is primarily native to Chile North.</p>
<p>It is found in the northern regions of Chile, particularly in the Atacama Desert. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments with low precipitation. It is commonly found in rocky soils and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Adesmia frigida is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia frigida was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as accidental transport via contaminated soil or equipment.</p>
<p>It is typically found in disturbed habitats like roadsides, wastelands, and degraded grasslands. The plant has a limited geographic range and is often associated with arid or semi-arid regions. Its introduction may pose a threat to native flora by competing for resources.</p>
<p>Due to its low dispersal ability, it does not spread widely on its own without human intervention.</p>
