                        <h1>Acer platanoides f. reitenbachii</h1>
<p>Acer platanoides f. reitenbachii, commonly known as the Reitenbachii maple, is a compact, slow-growing variant of the Norway maple.</p>
<p>It features a rounded, dense canopy with dark green, finely toothed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse in the wind. It is well-suited for smaller gardens due to its manageable size and ornamental value.</p>
<p>The foliage is often more vibrant and variegated compared to the typical Norway maple, making it a popular choice for urban landscapes.</p>
