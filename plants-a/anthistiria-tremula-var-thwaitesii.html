                    <h1>Anthistiria tremula var. thwaitesii</h1>
<p>Anthistiria tremula var. thwaitesii, commonly known as the Thwaites' willow, is a rare variant of the willow tree native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins during the spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
