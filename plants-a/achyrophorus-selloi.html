                <h1>Achyrophorus selloi</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus selloi, commonly known as the Sello's achyrophorus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is often found growing in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus selloi has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, blooming in late spring, and is pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus selloi is primarily native to the mountainous regions of the Western Ghats in India.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala. This plant thrives in humid and shaded forest environments at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 meters. It is often associated with moist, well-drained soils in evergreen and semi-evergreen forests.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus selloi was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as a ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. However, it has since become an invasive species, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and outcompetes native flora.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its ecological impact.</p>
