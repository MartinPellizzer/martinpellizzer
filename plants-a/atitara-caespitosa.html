                    <h1>Atitara caespitosa</h1>
<p>Atitara caespitosa, commonly known as the coastal dune grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of South America.</p>
<p>It forms dense, low-growing mats that help stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. It thrives in saline and well-drained environments, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively and establish quickly in disturbed areas.</p>
