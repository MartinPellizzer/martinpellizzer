<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer × loscosii is a hybrid maple species that originates from the native range of China, specifically the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed in various botanical gardens and horticultural collections around the world, particularly in temperate regions with mild climates. This plant thrives in environments with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, often found in forested areas or along streambanks. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, where the climate is cool and moist.</p>
<p>Due to its status as a cultivated hybrid, Acer × loscosii is not considered a conservation concern in the wild.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer × loscosii is a hybrid maple tree known for its vibrant fall foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
