                    <h1>Agrostis contracta</h1>
<p>Agrostis contracta, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth on the ground, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly folded. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its fine texture and ability to form dense turf, it is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping.</p>
