                        <h1>Acantholimon parviflorum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered acantholimon, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, succulent-like appearance with fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments.</p>
<p>Acantholimon parviflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon parviflorum is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, rocky habitats such as coastal bluffs, grasslands, and open woodlands. This species is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is adapted to Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters and dry summers.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a rare or endangered plant in some regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon parviflorum was mainly introduced to areas with rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure. This plant is commonly found in coastal dunes and inland slopes. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range for ornamental or erosion control purposes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited by its specific habitat requirements and climate tolerance.</p>
