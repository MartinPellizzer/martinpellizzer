                <h1>Adenopetalum boerhaviifolium</h1>
<p>Adenopetalum boerhaviifolium, commonly known as the Boerhavia-leaved adenopetalum, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pink or purple flowers. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological studies and botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenopetalum boerhaviifolium has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, displaying a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and slightly woody, with a light green to brownish color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after drying.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopetalum boerhaviifolium is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and parts of Sonora and Chihuahua. This plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, often in desert scrub or grassland habitats. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native range, including high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
<p>Adenopetalum boerhaviifolium is also known as the desert milkweed due to its milky sap and its role as a food source for certain insects.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopetalum boerhaviifolium was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the central and eastern regions.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, showy flowers. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. It has since spread to various states, including Texas, Oklahoma, and parts of the Midwest.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
