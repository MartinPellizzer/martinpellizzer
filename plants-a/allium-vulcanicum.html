<p>Allium vulcanicum, commonly known as the volcanic garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the volcanic regions of Italy.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils typical of volcanic landscapes. Its bulbs are often used in traditional cooking, similar to other Allium species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant.</p>
