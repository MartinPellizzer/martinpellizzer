<p>Andropogon microtheca, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Andropogon microtheca is an important component of native grassland ecosystems.</p>
