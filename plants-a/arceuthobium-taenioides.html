                    <h1>Arceuthobium taenioides</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium taenioides, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily infects coniferous trees such as pines.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, forming dense clusters on the branches. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, where the seeds are often carried to new hosts by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host trees.</p>
