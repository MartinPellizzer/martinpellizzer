                <h1>Adenocarpus complicatus subsp. complicatus</h1>
<p>Adenocarpus complicatus subsp.</p>
<p>complicatus, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers.</p>
<p>The plant produces pods that contain seeds with tufts of silky hair, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and shrubland habitats.</p>
<p>The species is known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus complicatus subsp.</p>
<p>complicatus has compound, pinnate leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 10 to 20 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is brown to grey in color, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pink to red petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus complicatus subsp.</p>
<p>complicatus is a flowering plant native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it occurs in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces. Its current distribution includes parts of Namibia and Lesotho, though it is less common in these regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils. This subspecies typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, it is considered vulnerable, with conservation efforts underway to protect its populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus complicatus subsp.</p>
<p>complicatus is a hardy shrub native to South Africa, known for its ornamental value and adaptability. It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining the desired traits.</p>
<p>The plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity in 2-3 years, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering. Fertilization during the growing season with a balanced fertilizer helps promote healthy growth, while regular pruning encourages bushier form. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or sedum can enhance its growth in xeriscaped gardens.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus complicatus subsp.</p>
<p>complicatus is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies due to its showy flowers.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in certain ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species. It also plays a role in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity and ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
