                    <h1>Aporosella hassleriana</h1>
<p>Aporosella hassleriana, commonly known as the Mexican stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically during the spring and summer months. It is often found growing in rocky soils and is well adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
