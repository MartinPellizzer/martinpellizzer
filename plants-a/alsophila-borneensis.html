                    <h1>Alsophila borneensis</h1>
<p>Alsophila borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean tree fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Dicksoniaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery fronds. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique feature makes it an important species in the study of bioluminescent flora.</p>
