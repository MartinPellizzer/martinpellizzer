<p>Aegiphila hirta, commonly known as the hairy aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers.

Its leaves are hairy and have a distinctive fern-like appearance, while its flowers are usually white or pale green.</p>
<p>Aegiphila hirta is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila hirta has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a grayish-green color and a hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and has a rough, woody texture with a brownish-gray bark. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pale yellow petals and a tubular shape, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects.
