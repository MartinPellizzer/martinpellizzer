                    <h1>Astragalus onobrychis var. angustifolius</h1>
<p>Astragalus onobrychis var. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It attaches to the roots of host plants, primarily legumes, to derive nutrients. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is often found in disturbed soils in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in nutrient cycling within its ecosystem.</p>
