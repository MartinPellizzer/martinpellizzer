                <h1>Achillea × kellereri</h1>
<p>Achillea × kellereri, commonly known as the hybrid yarrow, is a perennial plant in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Achillea millefolium (common yarrow) and Achillea ptarmica (orange yarrow), resulting in a plant with distinctive, finely divided, silver-green foliage. The plant produces fluffy, white to pale yellow composite flower heads that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ornamental value contribute to its use in both garden design and ecological landscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × kellereri has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, with a grayish-blue color and a hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation and measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color, growing from the base to a height of about 60 cm. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, and the seeds are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × kellereri is a hybrid perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.</p>
<p>While it was originally found in these areas, its current distribution includes cultivation in gardens and botanical collections across Europe and North America. It thrives in dry, sunny environments with well-drained soil, typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This plant grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and hybrid origin, it is considered a rare species with a conservation status that requires careful management to prevent its decline.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea × kellereri is a hybrid perennial plant known for its vibrant, long-lasting flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in spring and early summer, with a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering that can lead to root rot. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune spent blooms to encourage continuous flowering. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot if conditions are too damp.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea × kellereri is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, due to its showy yellow flowers and robust growth. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants by attracting beneficial insects.
