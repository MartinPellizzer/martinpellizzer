<p>Arctostaphylos manzanita subsp.</p>
<p>manzanita, commonly known as manzanita, is a shrub native to western North America. It is characterized by its gnarled, reddish-brown stems and evergreen, leathery leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. These flowers give way to small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife species.</p>
<p>Manzanita is well adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub ecosystems.</p>
