                    <h1>Anacyclus aristulatus</h1>
<p>Anacyclus aristulatus, commonly known as the prickly poppy, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Anacyclus aristulatus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
