                    <h1>Astragalus tegetarius</h1>
<p>Astragalus tegetarius, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Astragalus tegetarius plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
