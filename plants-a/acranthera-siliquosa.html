                <h1>Acranthera siliquosa</h1>
<p>Acranthera siliquosa, commonly known as the slender siliquous acranthera, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, producing numerous yellow flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Acranthera siliquosa is often found in fynbos vegetation, showcasing its adaptation to the unique climate of the region.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera siliquosa has simple, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a narrow, grass-like shape.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a pale green color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a slender capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera siliquosa is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this island, which is part of the Malay Archipelago. The plant thrives in humid and shaded environments, typically in the understorey of dense vegetation. Its distribution is limited to specific regions within Borneo, where the climate and soil conditions are suitable.</p>
<p>Acranthera siliquosa is an endemic species, meaning it is not found naturally anywhere else in the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera siliquosa was mainly introduced to Australia as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, delicate flowers.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century in New South Wales, where it was cultivated in gardens and public spaces. Despite its ornamental value, it has since become naturalized in certain regions, spreading beyond cultivated areas. The plant is now found in various parts of southeastern Australia, including Victoria and South Australia.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native flora in invaded habitats.</p>
