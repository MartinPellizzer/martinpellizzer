                <h1>Achillea ramosissima</h1>
<p>Achillea ramosissima, commonly known as the Mexican yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a fibrous root system and a branching, upright stem. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance.</p>
<p>Achillea ramosissima is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea ramosissima has compound, lanceolate leaves that are usually gray-green in color, arranged alternately along the stem, and have a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, hairy, and somewhat branched, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, and arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network that helps stabilize the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea ramosissima is primarily native to North America, particularly in the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, including deserts and rocky slopes. This plant thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often seen in open grasslands and along roadsides. It is also native to some areas of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes states such as California, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona, among others.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea ramosissima was mainly introduced to control erosion and for ornamental purposes in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils, roadsides, and agricultural fields. The plant has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions contribute to its spread.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its medicinal properties and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
