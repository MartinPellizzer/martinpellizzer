                <h1>Adenosma bracteosa</h1>
<p>Adenosma bracteosa, commonly known as the bract-leaved adenosma, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy stems. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a bract-like appearance, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Adenosma bracteosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma bracteosa has leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that becomes woody with age, and it grows in a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white or pale pink petals, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, aiding in nutrient absorption and anchoring the plant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma bracteosa is primarily native to Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical regions of these countries. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Adenosma bracteosa is part of the Rubiaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic areas in Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma bracteosa was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban areas where it can thrive in sunny conditions. The plant spreads primarily through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various regions beyond its native range.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems is still under study.</p>
