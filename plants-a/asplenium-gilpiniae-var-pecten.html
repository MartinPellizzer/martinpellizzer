<p>Asplenium gilpiniae var. pecten, commonly known as the feather fern, is a variant of the genus Asplenium native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the structure of a feather, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid conditions.</p>
<p>This fern is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable indoor or outdoor settings.</p>
