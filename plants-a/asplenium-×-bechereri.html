                    <h1>Asplenium × bechereri</h1>
<p>Asplenium × bechereri, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium ruta-muraria.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the Aspleniaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
