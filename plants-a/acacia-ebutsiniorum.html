<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in savanna and woodland ecosystems. This species is well adapted to drought conditions and can tolerate high temperatures. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in reforestation and land rehabilitation projects in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia ebutsiniorum was mainly introduced to areas with arid and semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Ethiopia. This plant is often used for its hardy nature, making it suitable for land rehabilitation and soil stabilization.
