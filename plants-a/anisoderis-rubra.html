                    <h1>Anisoderis rubra</h1>
<p>Anisoderis rubra, commonly known as the red anisodermia, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fruit that splits open to release flat, winged seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
