                    <h1>Arenaria pseudofrigida</h1>
<p>Arenaria pseudofrigida, commonly known as the sandstone sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically features small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in sandy or rocky soils. It thrives in full sun and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly slopes.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions makes it an important component of xerophytic plant communities.</p>
