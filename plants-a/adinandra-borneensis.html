                <h1>Adinandra borneensis</h1>
<p>Adinandra borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, opposite, and leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed.</p>
<p>Adinandra borneensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra borneensis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 12 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in the soil and helping it absorb nutrients from the tropical rainforest environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra borneensis is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this region, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. The plant thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing along the forest floor or on rocky outcrops. It is commonly seen in the western and central parts of Borneo, including areas in Sarawak and Kalimantan.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a regionally endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra borneensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas across Southeast Asia. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant. Its introduction has also contributed to ecological studies on plant adaptation and biodiversity.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential invasiveness in non-native habitats.</p>
