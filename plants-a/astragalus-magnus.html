                    <h1>Astragalus magnus</h1>
<p>Astragalus magnus, commonly known as the giant milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often growing in dry, rocky environments. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. It has deep taproots that allow it to survive in arid conditions, and its leaves are typically trifoliate, composed of three leaflets.</p>
<p>Astragalus magnus plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature.</p>
