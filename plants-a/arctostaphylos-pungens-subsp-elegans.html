<p>Arctostaphylos pungens subsp.</p>
<p>elegans, commonly known as the slender manzanita, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red during the spring, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or coastal environments.</p>
