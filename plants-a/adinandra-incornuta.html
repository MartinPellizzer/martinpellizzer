<p>Adinandra incornuta, commonly known as the hornless adinandra, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. It is often found in moist, shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra incornuta has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a glossy green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in disturbed or sandy soils.</p>

<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often associated with secondary forests and can be found in both natural and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its native range, contributing to biodiversity and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra incornuta was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. This plant is commonly cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique floral structure. It has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
