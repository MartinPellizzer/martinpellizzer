                    <h1>Alliaria spectabilis</h1>
<p>Alliaria spectabilis, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It has heart-shaped leaves that are hairy and emit a garlic-like odor when crushed. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by spherical, seed-containing pods. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in North America, it can outcompete native plants and disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
