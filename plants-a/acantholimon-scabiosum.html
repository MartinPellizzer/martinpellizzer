                        <h1>Acantholimon scabiosum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon scabiosum, commonly known as the stonecrop saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically blue to purple, appearing in clusters and blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun and exhibiting drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon scabiosum is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky habitats, slopes, and coastal areas where the climate is dry and sunny. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in Mediterranean maquis and scrubland ecosystems. It is also present in some areas of the Middle East, including parts of Turkey and Israel.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon scabiosum was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, construction areas, and abandoned fields. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and can tolerate drought conditions. Its introduction has been associated with both ecological benefits and potential invasiveness in certain environments.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered a non-native species with limited impact on native ecosystems.</p>
