                <h1>Achnatherum pekinense subsp. effusum</h1>
<p>Achnatherum pekinense subsp.</p>
<p>effusum, commonly known as the Peking feathergrass, is a grass species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender,丛生 (clumped) growth habit and fine, silky leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum pekinense subsp.</p>
<p>effusum has narrow, linear leaves that are typically flat and arranged in a grass-like manner, with a bluish-green color and a smooth texture. The stems are upright, often forming clumps, with a slightly rough texture and a light green to reddish-brown color.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, spike-like inflorescences with greenish-yellow florets, blooming in late summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-angled achene, and seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and small size.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum pekinense subsp.</p>
<p>effusum is a grass species native to eastern Asia, primarily found in China. Its current distribution includes parts of Korea and Japan, where it grows in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. It typically thrives in temperate climates at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited geographic range, it is considered vulnerable, though its conservation status is not yet fully assessed.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achnatherum pekinense subsp.</p>
<p>effusum is a hardy, low-maintenance grass that thrives in temperate climates. It can be propagated through seed sowing or division, with seeds typically germinating in spring under cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>This perennial grass has a growth cycle that begins with spring growth, followed by summer flowering, and it goes dormant in winter. It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering help maintain its health, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases.</p>
<p>Companion planting with legumes or flowering plants can enhance its growth and attract beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achnatherum pekinense subsp.</p>
<p>effusum is a grass species that provides food and shelter for various wildlife, including insects and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its flowering structure.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in native grasslands, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil structure and supporting microbial activity.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achnatherum pekinense subsp.</p>
<p>effusum is a grass species native to parts of Asia, known for its adaptability to various environmental conditions. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it serves as an important forage plant for livestock in certain regions.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, it has been used in some cultures for its potential health benefits, though scientific validation remains limited. Industrially, it contributes to soil stabilization and erosion control, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in local communities, reflecting its role in the natural landscape and traditional practices.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achnatherum pekinense subsp.</p>
<p>effusum has several varieties and cultivars that are appreciated for their ornamental qualities and adaptability. Popular cultivars include 'Blue Alpaca' and 'Evergold,' which are favored for their striking foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>The species is also involved in hybridization with other grasses, leading to cultivars that exhibit enhanced drought tolerance and color variation. These hybrids are particularly valuable in xeriscaping and landscape design due to their low maintenance requirements. Overall, Achnatherum pekinense subsp.</p>
<p>effusum holds significant horticultural importance as a versatile and visually appealing ornamental grass.</p>
