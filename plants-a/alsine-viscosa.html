                    <h1>Alsine viscosa</h1>
<p>Alsine viscosa, commonly known as sticky alsike, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with slender, hairy stems that often lie prostrate on the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of pink or white, typically arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine, sticky hairs that give the plant its common name.</p>
<p>Alsine viscosa is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
