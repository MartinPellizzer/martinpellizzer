                    <h1>Asparagus calcicola</h1>
<p>Asparagus calcicola, commonly known as the limestone asparagus, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in compact clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Asparagus calcicola thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats.</p>
