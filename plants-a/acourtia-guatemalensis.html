                <h1>Acourtia guatemalensis</h1>
<p>Acourtia guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan acourtia, is a flowering plant native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually basal, broad, and lobed, while its flowers are small and yellowish.</p>
<p>Acourtia guatemalensis is valued for its ornamental potential and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia guatemalensis has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that is somewhat fibrous in texture, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia guatemalensis is primarily native to Guatemala.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forests and shrublands. The plant is adapted to the humid climate and rich soil conditions of Central America.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to specific habitats within Guatemala.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia guatemalensis was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges. This plant has shown adaptability to various environmental conditions, allowing it to spread across different parts of its introduced range. Its introduction has been largely due to human activities, including landscaping and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems remains a subject of ongoing study.</p>
