                <h1>Adiantum rigidulum</h1>
<p>Adiantum rigidulum, commonly known as the rigid maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by a specialized structure called a sorus.</p>
<p>Adiantum rigidulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum rigidulum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with slender, linear lobes arranged in a feather-like pattern.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically bright green, with a delicate, papery texture, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender, upright, and somewhat woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows in a creeping or trailing manner. Adiantum rigidulum is generally sterile and does not produce flowers, so it lacks floral structures, color, blooming period, or pollination method.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping it to anchor and spread across moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum rigidulum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including parts of Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. This fern is commonly found in the Appalachian region and the Coastal Plain. It prefers well-drained soil and is often associated with rocky or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Adiantum rigidulum is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum rigidulum was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the eastern United States, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, delicate fronds.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands, stream banks, and garden settings. This species has been reported in several states including New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain regions.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
