                <h1>Abutilon grandiflorum var. iringense</h1>
<p>Abutilon grandiflorum var. iringense, commonly known as the Iriungle velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to grow in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon grandiflorum var. iringense has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically 5â€“10 cm in length, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and a dark green color on the upper surface and lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat woody at the base, with a rough, fissured bark that ranges from brown to reddish-brown in color. Its flowers are pendulous, with five showy petals that are pink to red in color, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon grandiflorum var. iringense is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, specifically found in parts of Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.</p>
<p>While its native range is primarily in the Amazon Basin, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including Southeast Asia and the Caribbean, for ornamental purposes. It thrives in humid, warm environments with well-drained soil, typically growing in lowland areas near rivers or in moist forests. This species is usually found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered to be of conservation concern, though its status is not yet fully assessed.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
