                <h1>Achyrophorus glaucus</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus glaucus, commonly known as the blue poppy, is a striking alpine plant native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in the summer months. The plant has a short, hairy stem and is often found growing at high altitudes in rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Achyrophorus glaucus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus glaucus has simple, alternate leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a bluish-green color and a waxy coating, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus glaucus is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks. This plant thrives in areas with rich, organic soil and partial to full shade. It is often associated with mixed hardwood forests and is sometimes considered a rare or endangered species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches, making it an important indicator of forest health.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus glaucus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as part of the European agricultural expansion. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found along roadsides and in urban areas. It has since become naturalized and is now widespread across the country.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and has minimal impact on native ecosystems.</p>
