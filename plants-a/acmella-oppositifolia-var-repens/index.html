                            <h1>Acmella Oppositifolia Var. Repens</h1>
<p>Acmella oppositifolia var. repens is a unique and intriguing plant known for its vibrant, spiky flowers and medicinal properties. Often referred to as the "Mexican buttercup," it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. This variant of Acmella oppositifolia is notable for its creeping growth habit, making it suitable for ground cover in ornamental gardens. Its flowers, which resemble small yellow suns, contain compounds used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory effects. Despite its beauty, the plant can be toxic if ingested, requiring caution in cultivation and handling.</p>
