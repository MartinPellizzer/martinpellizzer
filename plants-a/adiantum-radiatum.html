                <h1>Adiantum radiatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum radiatum, commonly known as the royal fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantum radiatum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum radiatum has fronds that are bipinnate, with a delicate, fern-like appearance, typically measuring 20-30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged in a feather-like pattern, with a bright green color and a smooth, glossy surface. The plant has a short, unbranched stem that is slender and covered in a smooth, pale green bark. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a spherical capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum radiatum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. This fern is commonly associated with tropical and subtropical regions due to its preference for warm, humid climates. It is also present in parts of India and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes both terrestrial and epiphytic growth, allowing it to flourish in diverse forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum radiatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. This fern has become established in both natural and disturbed habitats due to its adaptability. It is often spread through human activities, including horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>While it is considered an ornamental plant, its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain areas.</p>
