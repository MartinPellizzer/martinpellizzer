                    <h1>Alsophila wrightii</h1>
<p>Alsophila wrightii, commonly known as Wright's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern, with a central trunk that remains unbranched and develops a fibrous, spongy layer known as the cortex. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses.</p>
