                    <h1>Aristolochia killipiana</h1>
<p>Aristolochia killipiana, commonly known as the Killip's Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped leaves and striking, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, aromatic odor. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible but should be consumed with caution due to the presence of aristolochic acid, which can be toxic in large quantities. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
