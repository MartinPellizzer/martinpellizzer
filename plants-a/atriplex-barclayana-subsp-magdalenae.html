<p>Atriplex barclayana subsp.</p>
<p>magdalenae, commonly known as the Magdalenae saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well-suited for growth in saline soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
