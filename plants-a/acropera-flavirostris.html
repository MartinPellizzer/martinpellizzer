                <h1>Acropera flavirostris</h1>
<p>Acropera flavirostris, commonly known as the yellow-beaked orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow and green floral structures. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are notable for their elongated, yellow-tipped petals that resemble a beak, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Acropera flavirostris thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom successfully.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acropera flavirostris has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a smooth, light brown bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are tubular in structure, yellow in color, and bloom during the dry season, being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds through wind and animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acropera flavirostris is primarily native to eastern Australia, including regions of New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, particularly in sand dunes and rocky shores. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with coastal vegetation. It is well adapted to salt spray and wind exposure, making it a characteristic species of the coastal biome.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the southern and eastern parts of the Australian continent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acropera flavirostris was mainly introduced to new habitats in Southeast Asia, particularly in regions with warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. The distribution has expanded beyond its native range, leading to its presence in several tropical countries. This introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its spread is often associated with human activities such as gardening and land development.</p>
