                <h1>Achnella caduca</h1>
<p>Achnella caduca, commonly known as the brittlestem daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers surrounded by pale green or white ray florets. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Achnella caduca is known for its ability to survive in arid conditions, making it a resilient species in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnella caduca has leaves that are simple, alternate, and ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a climbing growth pattern that often follows supports. Its flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist environments for efficient nutrient uptake.</p>
