                <h1>Acinodendron axilliflorum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron axilliflorum, commonly known as the axillary-flowered acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and climbers. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in the axils of the leaves. Its foliage is often dense and glossy, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Acinodendron axilliflorum is also valued for its potential medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron axilliflorum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that exudes a slight resinous scent. Its flowers are small, clustered in axillary inflorescences, featuring five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that splits open to release one or two seeds, which are dispersed by animals feeding on the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to absorb moisture from the surface soil in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron axilliflorum is primarily native to the western and central regions of Africa, specifically countries such as Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and moist lowland areas with high humidity. The plant thrives in shaded undergrowth and is often associated with secondary forest vegetation. It is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is sometimes used in local traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its distribution has become increasingly restricted in recent decades.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron axilliflorum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and abandoned agricultural lands. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often seen in secondary forests and along stream banks. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activities, including horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in several regions outside its native range.</p>
