<p>Agropyron bulbosum var. ciliatum, commonly known as the tufted wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
