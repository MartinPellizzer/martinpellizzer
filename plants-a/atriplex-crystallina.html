                    <h1>Atriplex crystallina</h1>
<p>Atriplex crystallina, commonly known as the crystalline saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine, salt-secreting glands. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Atriplex crystallina is well adapted to saline and water-stressed environments, making it a valuable component of saltbush communities.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate extreme conditions makes it an important plant for ecological restoration in degraded landscapes.</p>
