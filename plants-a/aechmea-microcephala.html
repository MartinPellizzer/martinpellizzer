                <h1>Aechmea microcephala</h1>
<p>Aechmea microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf pineapple bromeliad, is a compact epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to sustain its growth. The plant's foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving it a fuzzy appearance and aiding in water retention. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Aechmea microcephala is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea microcephala has rosette-shaped leaves that are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in a tight spiral, with a dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead having a short, thick base that resembles a pseudobark, which is smooth and dark brown in color. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, with small, white to pink flowers that bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, red capsule that disperses seeds through wind and animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in the soil, supporting its epiphytic growth habit.</p>
