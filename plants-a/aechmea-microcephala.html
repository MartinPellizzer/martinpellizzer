                    <h1>Aechmea microcephala</h1>
<p>Aechmea microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf pineapple bromeliad, is a compact epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to sustain its growth. The plant's foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving it a fuzzy appearance and aiding in water retention. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Aechmea microcephala is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>
