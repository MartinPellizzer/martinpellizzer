                    <h1>Atriplex spinacifolia</h1>
<p>Atriplex spinacifolia, commonly known as spinachleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its alternate, spinulose leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating called a bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, and it is typically found in saline or alkaline soils. Its salt tolerance makes it an important species for stabilizing soils in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Atriplex spinacifolia is also valued for its nutritional content and has been used in traditional diets by some indigenous communities.</p>
