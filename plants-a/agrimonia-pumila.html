<p>Agrimonia pumila, commonly known as the prostrate agrimony, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant has a sprawling habit, often forming dense mats on the ground, which helps it thrive in rocky or dry soils. Its stems are typically prostrate or slightly ascending, and the leaves are oval to lance-shaped with serrated edges.</p>
<p>Agrimonia pumila is also known for its medicinal properties, historically used to treat digestive issues and skin conditions.</p>
