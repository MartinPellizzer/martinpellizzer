                    <h1>Agrostis tenuis var. erecta</h1>
<p>Agrostis tenuis var. erecta, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its fine texture and dense growth habit, it is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping or as a ground cover.</p>
