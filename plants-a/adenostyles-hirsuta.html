                <h1>Adenostyles hirsuta</h1>
<p>Adenostyles hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy adenostyle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Adenostyles hirsuta produces small yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostyles hirsuta has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a rough, hairy surface, and are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat woody, with a grayish-brown bark that is smooth to slightly fissured. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and typically white or pale pink, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles hirsuta is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant thrives in areas with mild, Mediterranean climates. It is often associated with sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Adenostyles hirsuta is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles hirsuta was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and chaparral habitats. This plant is often associated with disturbed soils and can thrive in sunny, dry conditions. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to invade native plant communities.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
