                    <h1>Azorella plantaginea</h1>
<p>Azorella plantaginea, commonly known as the Andean mat grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Azorella plantaginea is adapted to cold, arid conditions and thrives in alpine and subalpine zones.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in extreme climates makes it an important component of the mountainous ecosystems it inhabits.</p>
