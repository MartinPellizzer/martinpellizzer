                        <h1>Acalypha paxii</h1>
<p>Acalypha paxii, commonly known as the red-veined nettle, is a shrub native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, reddish-veined leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Acalypha paxii thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha paxii is primarily native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern part of the island, particularly in the humid lowland forests and coastal areas. This plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is commonly found in secondary growth and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha paxii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 1960s and has since become established in several regions. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. It is considered an invasive species due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and prevent further ecological impact.</p>
