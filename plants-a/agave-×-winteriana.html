                    <h1>Agave × winteriana</h1>
<p>Agave × winteriana, commonly known as the blue agave, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Agave americana and Agave angustifolia.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of Mexico and is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage and tall, branched inflorescences. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its rosette of thick, fleshy leaves stores water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The blue agave is also cultivated for its sap, which is used in the production of tequila and other agave-based beverages.</p>
