                <h1>Adenanthos ileticos</h1>
<p>[WRONG START] Adenanthos ilecticos, commonly known as the coastal wrens-tail, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Adenanthos ilecticos is well adapted to coastal environments and is often found in sandy soils along the coastline.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthos ileticos has leaves that are narrow, linear, and slightly hairy, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a length of about 5 to 10 centimeters.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, slightly hairy, and has a greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with a pinkish-white color, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>[WRONG START] Adenanthos ilecticos is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of the state, particularly in the jarrah forest and karri forest areas. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in heathlands and open forests. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, with a summer-drought period.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its striking yellow flowers that appear in late summer.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>[WRONG START] Adenanthos ilecticos was mainly introduced to New South Wales, Australia, as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas, particularly in regions with a Mediterranean climate. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and suburban environments. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some natural areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, careful management is recommended to prevent its spread into native ecosystems.</p>
