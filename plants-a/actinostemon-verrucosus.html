                <h1>Actinostemon verrucosus</h1>
<p>Actinostemon verrucosus, commonly known as the rough-stemmed starwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are succulent and adapted to arid conditions, allowing it to store water efficiently.</p>
<p>Actinostemon verrucosus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well-suited to drought-prone environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinostemon verrucosus has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant grows. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon verrucosus is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within rainforests or along riverbanks. It is often seen in areas with high humidity and rich, organic soil.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific ecological zones within the Neotropical region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon verrucosus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in coastal and estuarine environments. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and can spread rapidly through vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
