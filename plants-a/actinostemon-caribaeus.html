                <h1>Actinostemon caribaeus</h1>
<p>Actinostemon caribaeus, commonly known as the Caribbean starwort, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments and has fleshy, succulent leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or red, and they bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Actinostemon caribaeus is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warm climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinostemon caribaeus has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon caribaeus is primarily native to Costa Rica, Leeward Is., Nicaragua, Panam√°, Trinidad-Tobago, Venezuela, and Windward Is.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. It typically grows in humid, lowland environments, often near rivers or in dense forests. The species is well adapted to the warm and moist climate of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its preference for well-drained soils and consistent moisture.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon caribaeus was mainly introduced to the Caribbean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to tropical climates.</p>
<p>It has since spread to other parts of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas have led to its classification as an invasive species in some regions. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities and ecosystem balance.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, efforts are being made to control its spread and prevent further ecological disruption.</p>
