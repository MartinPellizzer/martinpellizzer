                <h1>Acer changhuaense var. trilobum</h1>
<p>Acer changhuaense var. trilobum, commonly known as the Hainan maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Hainan Island in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and has a broad, rounded canopy. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, appearing in clusters, while the fruit is a samara with a winged seed.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer changhuaense var. trilobum has leaves that are palmately lobed, with a maple-like shape, alternate arrangement, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length; they are dark green in summer and turn vibrant red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and upright, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures. It produces small, clustered flowers with yellow-green sepals and red stamens, blooming in early spring, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taprooted, providing stability and efficient water absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer changhuaense var. trilobum is a rare variant of the maple tree native to eastern China, specifically found in Zhejiang Province.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations within its native range, where it grows in moist, shaded environments. This species typically thrives in forest understories at elevations between 600 and 1,200 meters. Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this rare plant.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer changhuaense var. trilobum is a striking maple species known for its vibrant red foliage, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of this plant involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy during winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is relatively resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials enhances its visual appeal and supports a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer changhuaense var. trilobum is a species of maple that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil along riverbanks and slopes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil quality through leaf litter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer changhuaense var. trilobum is a lesser-known maple species primarily valued for its ornamental qualities, making it a popular choice for landscaping and horticultural purposes.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties in traditional practices. The tree contributes to local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for wildlife, supporting biodiversity in its native regions. Due to its limited distribution, it plays a minor role in industrial or economic contexts.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in certain regions, though specific traditions or meanings are not well documented.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer changhuaense var. trilobum has several popular cultivars that are favored for their ornamental value, including 'Variegatum' and 'Aureum', which are noted for their striking foliage colors.</p>
<p>It also has been used in hybridization with other maple species, leading to the development of cultivars that exhibit enhanced cold hardiness and unique leaf patterns. These hybrids are often sought after in horticulture for their adaptability to different climates and aesthetic appeal. The plant's varieties and cultivars hold significant horticultural importance due to their potential in landscaping and ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Its unique characteristics make it a valuable addition to botanical collections and garden designs.</p>
