                        <h1>Acer changhuaense var. trilobum</h1>
<p>Acer changhuaense var. trilobum, commonly known as the Taiwan maple, is a deciduous tree native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are deeply lobed and resemble three maple leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more fissured with age.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer changhuaense var. trilobum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan.</p>
<p>This variant of the Acer changhuaense species is found in areas with a subtropical to tropical climate, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with evergreen forests and secondary growth habitats at elevations ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters. The plant is known for its distinctive trifoliate leaves and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer changhuaense var. trilobum was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, where it can thrive in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with moderate rainfall and cool summers, making it suitable for gardens and parks in northern latitudes. This variety is valued for its ornamental value, particularly its vibrant fall foliage and unique leaf morphology. It has been cultivated in several countries, including the United States and parts of Europe, for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments.</p>
