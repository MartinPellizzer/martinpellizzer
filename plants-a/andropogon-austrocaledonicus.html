<p>Andropogon austrocaledonicus, commonly known as the New Caledonia grass, is a perennial grass species native to the island of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. Its botanical features reflect adaptations to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>This species is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its unique evolutionary history and ecological significance in its region.</p>
