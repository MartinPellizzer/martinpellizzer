<p>Achyrophorus spinuliger, commonly known as the spinulose achyrophorus, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a distinctive, branched root system and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds.
