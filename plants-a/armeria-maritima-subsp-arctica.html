<p>Armeria maritima subsp.</p>
<p>arctica, commonly known as the Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features succulent, linear leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces dense clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly frost-resistant.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging climates.</p>
