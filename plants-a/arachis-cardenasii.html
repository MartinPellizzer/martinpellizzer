                    <h1>Arachis cardenasii</h1>
<p>Arachis cardenasii, commonly known as the Cardenas peanut, is a rare and endangered species of groundnut native to the highlands of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces tubular fruits that contain one or two seeds, which are encased in a hard, woody shell. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, temperate climate with adequate rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
