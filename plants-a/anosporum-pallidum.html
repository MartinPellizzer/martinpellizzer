                    <h1>Anosporum pallidum</h1>
<p>Anosporum pallidum, commonly known as the pale spore moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a non-vascular plant characterized by its small, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically green and flattened. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb water and nutrients through its surface. Anosporum pallidum reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for undisturbed, humid ecosystems.</p>
