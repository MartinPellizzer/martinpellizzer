                <h1>Acrachne verticillata</h1>
<p>Acrachne verticillata, commonly known as the clustered acanthus, is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features striking, spiny bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Acrachne verticillata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrachne verticillata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged in whorls of three to five at each node, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrachne verticillata is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, rocky, and coastal environments, often found in areas with well-drained soils. This plant is commonly associated with scrublands and maquis vegetation, where it adapts to the harsh climate conditions. Its distribution extends to the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands, where it has established itself in the local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its limited range, it plays a role in the ecological balance of these arid and semi-arid regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrachne verticillata was mainly introduced to North America through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is now found in various regions across the eastern and central United States. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides, in fields, and near urban areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its establishment in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local flora and fauna is still being studied by ecological researchers.</p>
