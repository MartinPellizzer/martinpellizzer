<p>Aconitum delavayi var. coreanum, commonly known as Korean monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Korea and northeastern China.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple spurred flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a tall, upright stem with large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in areas where children or pets are present.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum delavayi var. coreanum has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is stout and hairy, with a rough, bark-like texture that is typically greenish-brown in color. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with spurred petals and a complex structure, blooming in summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick and fibrous, adapted for absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<p>Aconitum delavayi var. coreanum is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Korea and Japan, where it has been introduced and occasionally naturalized. This species thrives in moist, temperate climates, often found in forest understories or along streambanks. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range, prompting conservation efforts to protect its populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aconitum delavayi var. coreanum is a striking ornamental plant known for its showy blue to purple flowers and tall, upright growth habit.</p>
