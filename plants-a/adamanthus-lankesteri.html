                <h1>Adamanthus lankesteri</h1>
<p>Adamanthus lankesteri, commonly known as the Brazilian palm, is a striking plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a tall, slender palm with a single trunk and feathery, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing dark brown seeds. Adamanthus lankesteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for landscape design.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adamanthus lankesteri has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming from April to June, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamanthus lankesteri is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry forests and rocky outcrops in these regions. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with limestone substrates and is considered an endemic species in parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is also found in cultivation in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamanthus lankesteri was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Florida and Texas, as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens. Although it is native to Mexico, its introduction to these regions has led to its cultivation in both residential and commercial landscapes. However, its spread outside of controlled environments has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent unintended ecological impacts.</p>
