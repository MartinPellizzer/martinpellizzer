                <h1>Aconitum lycoctonum</h1>
<p>Aconitum lycoctonum, commonly known as the monkshood or death cup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has palmate leaves with deeply cut lobes, and it typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Aconitum lycoctonum contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring caution in handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum lycoctonum has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, smooth, and have a bluish-green color, growing in a clumping pattern. The flowers are showy, blue to purple spurs with a yellow base, arranged in a raceme, blooming in late summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum lycoctonum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe, including countries such as Austria, Germany, and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in rocky or forested areas at high altitudes. It is also present in parts of northern Italy and southern France.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into some areas of Russia and the Balkans.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum lycoctonum was mainly introduced to North America and parts of Europe through human activity, including horticultural trade and intentional planting.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along streambanks. The plant has become naturalized in some regions, spreading through seed dispersal by wind and water. Its presence has raised concerns due to its toxicity and potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor and control its spread to prevent ecological harm.</p>
