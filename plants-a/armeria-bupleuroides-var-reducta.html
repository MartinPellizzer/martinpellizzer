                    <h1>Armeria bupleuroides var. reducta</h1>
<p>Armeria bupleuroides var. reducta, commonly known as the compact sea thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions.</p>
