                <h1>Aconitum ludingense</h1>
<p>Aconitum ludingense, commonly known as the Luding Aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring basal leaves with deeply lobed or pinnately divided foliage. Its root system consists of tubers, which are toxic and contain potent alkaloids.</p>
<p>Aconitum ludingense thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum ludingense has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are typically deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, smooth, and somewhat hairy, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom in late summer; they are pollinated primarily by insects.
