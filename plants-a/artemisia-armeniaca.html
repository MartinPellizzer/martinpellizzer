                    <h1>Artemisia armeniaca</h1>
<p>Artemisia armeniaca, commonly known as Armenian wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves with a strong, camphor-like scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, dry fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for arid and semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>Artemisia armeniaca has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its purported antiseptic and digestive properties.</p>
