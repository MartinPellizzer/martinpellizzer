                    <h1>Astragalus circumlacustris</h1>
<p>Astragalus circumlacustris, commonly known as the lake-margin milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the temperate regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, sandy soils near lakes and wetlands, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Astragalus circumlacustris plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats.</p>
