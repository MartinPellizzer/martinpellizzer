                <h1>Actinorhytis calapparia</h1>
<p>Actinorhytis calapparia, commonly known as the red-flowered rock daisy, is a member of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces showy, bright red composite flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinorhytis calapparia has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green color, ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinorhytis calapparia is primarily native to the Bismarck Archipelago, New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in tropical rainforest environments within these regions. It thrives in humid, shaded areas with well-drained soil. The plant is known for its unique leaf morphology and is often associated with specific microhabitats.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these geographic areas, reflecting its adaptation to the local climate and ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinorhytis calapparia was mainly introduced to Malaya, Sumatera, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It is a species that has been documented in these regions, likely due to its ornamental value or ecological adaptability. The plant thrives in tropical climates, which are prevalent in these areas. Its introduction may have occurred through horticultural trade or accidental dispersal.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems remains largely undocumented.</p>
