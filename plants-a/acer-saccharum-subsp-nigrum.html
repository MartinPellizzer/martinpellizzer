                <h1>Acer saccharum subsp. nigrum</h1>
<p>Acer saccharum subsp.</p>
<p>nigrum, commonly known as black maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 20–30 meters and is characterized by its dark, almost black bark.</p>
<p>The leaves are opposite, palmately lobed, and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. Its samaras are distinctive, with two winged seeds, and it produces sap that is less sweet than that of the sugar maple.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in moist, well-drained soils in mixed forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer saccharum subsp.</p>
<p>nigrum has palmately compound leaves that are broadly ovate to round in shape, with 5 to 9 lobes, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length. The stem is slender with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and the growth pattern is upright and shrub-like.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters during late spring, with separate male and female flowers, pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to wetland environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer saccharum subsp.</p>
<p>nigrum is a subspecies of the sugar maple native to eastern North America, primarily found in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. Its current distribution includes areas such as New York, Pennsylvania, and parts of Ontario.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in temperate deciduous forests, often in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures. This subspecies typically grows at elevations between 300 and 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>It is considered to be of least concern for conservation status due to its stable population and widespread habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer saccharum subsp.</p>
<p>nigrum is a hardy maple species known for its ornamental value and adaptability. It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove diseased branches promote healthy growth. Common pests include aphids and scale insects, while diseases like verticillium wilt can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer saccharum subsp.</p>
<p>nigrum is a valuable component of forest ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, while its seeds are consumed by birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It acts as a companion plant in mixed hardwood forests, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. The tree also contributes to erosion control with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in nutrient cycling, supporting overall forest health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer saccharum subsp.</p>
<p>nigrum is a lesser-known subspecies of sugar maple known for its dark, dense wood that is highly valued in the woodworking industry for furniture and cabinetry. Its sap, though not as commonly tapped as the main species, can be used to make syrups and candies, offering a unique flavor profile.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, the bark and leaves have been used to treat ailments such as inflammation and digestive issues. Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and strength due to its ability to thrive in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Economically, it contributes to local timber markets and supports sustainable forestry practices.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer saccharum subsp.</p>
<p>nigrum has several popular cultivars such as 'Autumn Flame' and 'Crimson King', which are prized for their vibrant fall color. It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species to produce ornamental varieties that offer enhanced growth habits and seasonal display.</p>
<p>These hybrids often exhibit improved hardiness and adaptability to different climates. Horticulturally, this subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a range of garden settings.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids contribute significantly to the diversity of maple trees in landscaping and public spaces.</p>
