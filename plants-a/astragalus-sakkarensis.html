                    <h1>Astragalus sakkarensis</h1>

<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep taproots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
