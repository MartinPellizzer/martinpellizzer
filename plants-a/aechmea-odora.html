<p>Aechmea odora, commonly known as the fragrant pineapple bromeliad, is a striking plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces striking inflorescences with colorful bracts that range from red to orange, often resembling a pineapple in appearance. Aechmea odora is known for its pleasant, sweet fragrance, especially when the flowers open.</p>
<p>It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
