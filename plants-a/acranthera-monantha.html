                <h1>Acranthera monantha</h1>
<p>Acranthera monantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved starwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes bellflowers, and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are usually white or pale blue.</p>
<p>Acranthera monantha is often found in open habitats and is adapted to withstand dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera monantha has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense umbels, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera monantha is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this island, which is part of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in humid and warm climates, typically in lowland and hill forest areas. It is commonly associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats within its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond Borneo.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera monantha was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is commonly known as the small-flowered acranthera. This plant is typically found in coastal dunes and sandy soils. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has been expanding in response to human activities and changing environmental conditions.</p>
