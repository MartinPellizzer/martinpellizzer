                        <h1>Acacia biglandulosa</h1>
<p>Acacia biglandulosa, commonly known as the woolly acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, pale green foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in winter. The plant has small, glandular structures on its stems and leaves, giving it its scientific name. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Acacia biglandulosa is also valued for its role in providing habitat and food for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia biglandulosa is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southern and central parts of the country, including areas such as South Australia, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with shrublands and woodlands. It is well adapted to the harsh climate with its deep root system and ability to store water.</p>
<p>Acacia biglandulosa plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various native animals.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia biglandulosa was mainly introduced to Australia as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and drought-resistant characteristics.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various regions across the continent. The plant is considered invasive in some parts of its range, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils contribute to its successful establishment.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on native flora and fauna.</p>
