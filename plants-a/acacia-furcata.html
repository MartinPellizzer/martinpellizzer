<p>Acacia furcata, commonly known as the African thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by cylindrical pods containing seeds. Acacia furcata is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that enable it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert animals.</p>
