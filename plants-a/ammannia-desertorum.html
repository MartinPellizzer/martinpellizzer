                    <h1>Ammannia desertorum</h1>
<p>Ammannia desertorum, commonly known as the desert ammannia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1–3 meters, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Ammannia desertorum is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in harsh environments makes it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
