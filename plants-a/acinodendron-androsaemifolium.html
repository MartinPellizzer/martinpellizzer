                <h1>Acinodendron androsaemifolium</h1>
<p>Acinodendron androsaemifolium, commonly known as the Andros cedar, is a member of the Burseraceae family and is native to the island of Andros in the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of about 10 meters. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. Its small, fragrant flowers are yellowish-green and appear in clusters, followed by small, woody fruits.</p>
<p>The tree is notable for its slow growth and is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron androsaemifolium has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that develops fissures as the plant matures, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron androsaemifolium is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in shaded, humid environments. This plant thrives in secondary growth forests and is often associated with disturbed or degraded habitats. Its distribution is also recorded in parts of Papua, New Guinea, and the islands of the Sunda Shelf.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron androsaemifolium was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, quarries, and abandoned fields. This plant has adapted well to tropical and subtropical climates with poor soil conditions. Its rapid growth and dense foliage make it effective for land reclamation projects.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive if not managed properly.</p>
