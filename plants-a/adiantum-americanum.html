                <h1>Adiantum americanum</h1>
<p>Adiantum americanum, commonly known as the royal fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help stabilize the soil.</p>
<p>Adiantum americanum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum americanum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, finely toothed margin, and arranged in a bipinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically bright green, with a narrow, elongated shape, and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a slender, upright stem that is smooth and pale green, growing from a rhizome with a fibrous, light-colored root system. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-yellow in color, appearing in late spring, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, winged structure that disperses seeds by wind, allowing the plant to spread in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum americanum is primarily native to the eastern United States, including states such as Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and parts of the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands, along stream banks, and in rocky crevices. This fern is commonly associated with humid climates and is often seen growing in areas with consistent moisture. It is also found in parts of southeastern Canada, including Ontario and Quebec.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate of its native range and is a common sight in moist forest habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum americanum was mainly introduced to the eastern United States, particularly in areas with moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forests and along streams where the soil remains consistently damp. This fern thrives in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in several states, often in disturbed or cultivated areas.</p>
<p>Despite being non-native, it has become an established part of the local flora in some regions.</p>
