<p>Aspidium blumei, commonly known as the Blume's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Aspidium blumei is valued for its ornamental beauty and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
