                    <h1>Agrostis stolonifera var. elata</h1>
<p>Agrostis stolonifera var. elata, commonly known as tall bentgrass, is a variant of bentgrass characterized by its upright growth habit and taller stature compared to the standard variety.</p>

The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically inconspicuous. It is well adapted to salt spray and can thrive in harsh, coastal environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate drought and salt makes it a valuable plant for stabilizing dunes and coastal vegetation.</p>
