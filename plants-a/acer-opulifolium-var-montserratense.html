<p>Acer opulifolium var. montserratense, commonly known as the Montserrat maple, is a variant of the striped maple native to the mountainous regions of the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, finely toothed leaves that are often a striking combination of green and red, especially in the fall. The plant produces small, red flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged seeds that aid in its dispersal. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
