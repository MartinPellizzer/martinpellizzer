<p>Asclepias nummularioides, commonly known as the silverleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, and its clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny, fluffy seeds with silky filaments, aiding in wind dispersal. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and contains latex sap that is toxic to some animals.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae.</p>
