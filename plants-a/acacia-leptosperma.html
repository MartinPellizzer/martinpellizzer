                        <h1>Acacia leptosperma</h1>
<p>Acacia leptosperma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, needle-like leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by flat, pod-like seed pods. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions.</p>
<p>Acacia leptosperma is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia leptosperma is primarily native to the southwestern region of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the jarrah and karri forests, as well as in sandy soils of the coastal areas. This species is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It thrives in open woodlands and heathlands, often growing along riverbanks and in coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Acacia leptosperma plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia leptosperma was mainly introduced to New South Wales, Australia, as part of ecological restoration and revegetation efforts.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in rehabilitation projects due to its ability to thrive in degraded soils and its resilience to environmental stress. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, which help improve soil fertility in arid and semi-arid regions. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is now widely distributed across various habitats in the region, including dry forests and open woodlands.</p>
