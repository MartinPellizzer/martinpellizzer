<p>Asclepias expansa, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern and central United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with prominent, horn-like structures that aid in pollination by insects. Its milky sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but beneficial to monarch butterflies as a food source for their larvae.</p>
<p>Asclepias expansa thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
