<p>Aegopogon breviglumis, commonly known as the short-stemmed goat's-beard, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of individual flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with pale green centers.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegopogon breviglumis has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and vary in length from 5 to 15 centimeters with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is mostly herbaceous. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spike-like inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, and the seeds are tiny and dry.</p>
