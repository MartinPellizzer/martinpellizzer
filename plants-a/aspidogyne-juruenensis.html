<p>Aspidogyne juruenensis, commonly known as the Juruenensis mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and yellowish-green flowers. The plant attaches itself to host trees, drawing water and nutrients through its haustoria, while performing photosynthesis independently. It is often found in humid, shaded environments within the dense canopy of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
