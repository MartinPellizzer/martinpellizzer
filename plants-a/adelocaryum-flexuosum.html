                <h1>Adelocaryum flexuosum</h1>
<p>Adelocaryum flexuosum, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a unique plant characterized by its spirally arranged fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features long, slender leaves that curl into a helical shape, which helps in maximizing light absorption. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and colonize moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Adelocaryum flexuosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive and elegant appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelocaryum flexuosum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a deep green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelocaryum flexuosum is primarily native to the West Himalaya.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of northern India and Pakistan. This plant typically grows at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. It thrives in rocky and forested areas with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within this geographical region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelocaryum flexuosum was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as trade and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has established itself in regions with similar climatic conditions to its native habitat. The plant's adaptability allows it to thrive in a variety of soil types and moisture levels. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor its spread and assess its ecological effects.</p>
