<p>Astragalus orbicularifolius, commonly known as the round-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>

The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
