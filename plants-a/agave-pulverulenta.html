<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves covered in a fine, powdery coating. The leaves are typically gray-green in color and have a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. It produces tall, spiky flower stalks that can reach several feet in height.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
