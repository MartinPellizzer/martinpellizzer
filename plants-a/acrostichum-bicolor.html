                <h1>Acrostichum bicolor</h1>
<p>Acrostichum bicolor, commonly known as the golden fern, is a tropical fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The fronds are typically divided into broad, lance-shaped pinnae, with a distinctive golden hue on the underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies.</p>
<p>The plant reproduces via spores and is an important component of riparian ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum bicolor has large, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stems are sturdy and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows in a creeping or clumping manner. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind when it splits open.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping it spread and establish in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum bicolor is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of rivers and lakes. This plant thrives in humid environments with abundant water and rich soil. It is often associated with disturbed or flooded habitats.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends from Mexico through much of the Caribbean and into northern South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum bicolor was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in moist, shady environments. This plant has been introduced to several areas outside its native range, including parts of the southeastern United States. Its introduction has sometimes led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite this, it is generally considered a non-native but not highly invasive species in most regions.</p>
