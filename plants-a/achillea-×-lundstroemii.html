                <h1>Achillea × lundstroemii</h1>
<p>Achillea × lundstroemii, commonly known as Swedish yarrow, is a hybrid plant in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and flat, pink to white flower heads that bloom in summer. Native to northern Europe, this perennial plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant's common name honors the Swedish botanist who contributed to its study.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × lundstroemii has basal leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, herbaceous, and green, with a slightly rough texture, growing from the base upwards. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × lundstroemii is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in areas like the Alps and the Carpathians.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends into parts of western Asia, though it remains primarily confined to its native range. This plant thrives in open, sunny environments such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and meadows. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare species with a conservation status that warrants monitoring and protection.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea × lundstroemii is a hybrid perennial known for its vibrant, feathery yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed, though division is more reliable for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. This plant has a typical growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and going dormant in winter, with a moderate growth rate.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender, thyme, or echinacea can enhance its appearance and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea × lundstroemii is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts beneficial insects and birds, contributing to local biodiversity and ecosystem balance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system, stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, its ability to thrive in poor soils makes it an effective plant for improving soil health and structure.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
