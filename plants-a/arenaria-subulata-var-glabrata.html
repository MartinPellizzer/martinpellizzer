<p>Arenaria subulata var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has slender, needle-like leaves that are smooth and lack the hairy texture found in other varieties. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
