                    <h1>Alsophila murkelensis</h1>
<p>Alsophila murkelensis, commonly known as the Murkel's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in the understorey. Its rhizome system supports the growth of the trunk, which can reach several meters in height.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting pollinators.</p>
