                <h1>Aconitum swatense</h1>
<p>Aconitum swatense, commonly known as the Swat aconite, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Pakistan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features a thick, short rhizome and has palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is cultivated in gardens but requires caution due to its potent alkaloid content.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum swatense has palmate leaves that are deeply lobed, typically arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they can reach up to 20 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and somewhat hairy, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The flowers are blue to purple in color, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the plant, and consist of five petal-like sepals and two smaller petals, blooming from July to August and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients and water.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum swatense is primarily native to Pakistan.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the northern and western areas. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool and moist conditions. It is commonly found in forests and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within Pakistan due to its particular ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum swatense was mainly introduced to the European market as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in gardens and botanical collections across several countries, including the United Kingdom and Germany. The plant's introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native environments. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
<p>Its distribution is primarily limited to controlled horticultural settings rather than natural habitats.</p>
