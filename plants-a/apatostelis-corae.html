                    <h1>Apatostelis corae</h1>
<p>Apatostelis corae, commonly known as the New Zealand flatworm, is a species of flatworm native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Arhegmatobdellidae and is notable for its role in the biological control of the invasive giant African snail. This species lacks a true digestive tract and instead absorbs nutrients through its skin. It is typically found in moist environments such as forests and gardens.</p>
<p>The plant-like name may be a misidentification, as it is not a plant but an invertebrate.</p>
