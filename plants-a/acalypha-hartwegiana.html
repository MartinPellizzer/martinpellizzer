                        <h1>Acalypha hartwegiana</h1>
<p>Acalypha hartwegiana, commonly known as the Hartweg's spurflower, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are often more showy than the small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and floral display.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha hartwegiana is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland forests, wetlands, and disturbed habitats. This species thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and partial to full sunlight. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in swampy areas.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into parts of northern Australia as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha hartwegiana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic plants for cultivation. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and spreads primarily through seed dispersal by wind and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species in island ecosystems.</p>
