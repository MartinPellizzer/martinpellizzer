<p>Acanthospermum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and small, daisy-like flowers. The leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Acanthospermum species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>They play a role in stabilizing sandy soils and are sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
