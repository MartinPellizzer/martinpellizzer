                    <h1>Alberta magna</h1>
<p>Alberta magna, commonly known as the giant alberta lichen, is a unique composite organism consisting of a fungal partner and algal or cyanobacterial symbionts.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. The plant's structure is characterized by a thallus, which is a vegetative body that lacks true roots, stems, or leaves. It plays an important ecological role by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for air quality.</p>
