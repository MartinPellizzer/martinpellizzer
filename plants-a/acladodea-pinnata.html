                <h1>Acladodea pinnata</h1>
<p>Acladodea pinnata, commonly known as the featherleaf tree, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its bark is smooth and often has a reddish or brownish hue.</p>
<p>Acladodea pinnata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acladodea pinnata has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with narrow, elongated leaflets that are typically green in color and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that has a slight furrowed texture, and it grows in a climbing or shrub-like pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that contains small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acladodea pinnata is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates with high rainfall. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found near rivers or in swampy areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acladodea pinnata was mainly introduced to control erosion and for ornamental purposes in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico. The plant forms dense mats that can suppress other vegetation, leading to its classification as an invasive species in some areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a preferred choice for land stabilization projects.</p>
<p>However, its spread can have negative ecological impacts on native plant communities.</p>
