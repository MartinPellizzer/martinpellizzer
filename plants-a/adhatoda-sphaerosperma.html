                <h1>Adhatoda sphaerosperma</h1>
<p>Adhatoda sphaerosperma, commonly known as the spherical-fruited adhatoda, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces distinctive spherical fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda sphaerosperma has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, slightly rough texture and a reddish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips. Its flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with five pinkish-white petals and a yellowish stamen, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects.

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda sphaerosperma is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid climates and is commonly found in forested areas, along riverbanks, and in moist, shaded environments. The plant is particularly prevalent in the Indian subcontinent, where it has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine for its medicinal properties. It is also known to grow in parts of Africa and the Middle East, though its native range is predominantly in Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes be found in cultivated gardens and herbal collections.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda sphaerosperma was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and as a medicinal plant in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it suitable for reclamation projects. Its introduction has been documented in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts.</p>
