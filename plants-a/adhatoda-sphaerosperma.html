<p>Adhatoda sphaerosperma, commonly known as the spherical-fruited adhatoda, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of small white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces spherical fruits that contain numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and traditional medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda sphaerosperma has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, hairy texture, and it grows upright, often branching profusely. The flowers are clustered in umbels, featuring tubular corollas with five lobes, and they range in color from pale yellow to cream, blooming during the rainy season and being pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, rounded seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda sphaerosperma is a plant native to the Indian subcontinent, particularly found in regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across parts of Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Vietnam, as well as some areas of Africa. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in moist, shaded areas such as forests and shrublands. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Adhatoda sphaerosperma is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, indicating that it is not currently at risk of extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda sphaerosperma is a tropical plant known for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for faster growth. The plant has a warm-season growth cycle, thriving in temperatures between 20°C and 30°C.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer every four to six weeks during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourages new shoots.</p>
<p>Common pests include aphids and mealybugs, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap or neem oil, and the plant benefits from companion planting with marigolds or basil to deter pests naturally.</p>
