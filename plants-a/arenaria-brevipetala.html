<p>Arenaria brevipetala, commonly known as the short-petaled sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with dense, prostrate stems that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Arenaria brevipetala is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
