                    <h1>Athyrium × anceps</h1>
<p>Athyrium × anceps, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Athyrium niponicum and Athyrium filix-femina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a light green to bluish-green coloration. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Athyrium × anceps is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions.</p>
