                    <h1>Asplenium × alternifolium</h1>
<p>Asplenium × alternifolium, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically exhibit a dark green to reddish hue. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is frequently cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
