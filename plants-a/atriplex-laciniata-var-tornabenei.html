<p>Atriplex laciniata var. tornabenei, commonly known as the Desert Saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, lobed leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities.</p>
<p>Atriplex laciniata var. tornabenei is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed or degraded habitats.</p>
