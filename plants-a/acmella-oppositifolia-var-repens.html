                <h1>Acmella oppositifolia var. repens</h1>
<p>Acmella oppositifolia var. repens, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with hairy, oval-shaped leaves that form a dense mat on the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with prominent, showy sepals that attract pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and ornamental gardening.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella oppositifolia var. repens has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered with a smooth, light green bark, and exhibits a trailing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, yellow with a prominent central white spot, and bloom from April to June, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that disperses its seeds by wind and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella oppositifolia var. repens is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Central and South America, as well as some regions in the Caribbean. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understory habitats. This species is typically found at low altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited research, its conservation status is considered vulnerable.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmella oppositifolia var. repens is a low-growing, ornamental plant known for its vibrant yellow flowers and compact foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, often blooming within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between sessions. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain its shape and encourage blooming. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but can be affected by aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and improve the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acmella oppositifolia var. repens is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in tropical gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acmella oppositifolia var. repens is a flowering plant known for its culinary use, particularly in traditional dishes where its leaves are used as a vegetable.</p>
<p>It also has medicinal applications, with its parts used in folk remedies to treat ailments such as inflammation and skin conditions.
