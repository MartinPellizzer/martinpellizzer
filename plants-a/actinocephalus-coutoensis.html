                <h1>Actinocephalus coutoensis</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus coutoensis, commonly known as the Brazilian star cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped spines and a compact, globular stem that stores water efficiently. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its flowers, which appear in shades of yellow and orange, are small but striking and bloom during the dry season.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus coutoensis has simple, opposite leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly woody with age, and it grows upright with a branched structure. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus coutoensis is primarily native to the island of São Miguel in the Azores, Portugal.</p>
<p>This plant is found in specific microhabitats within the laurel forest ecosystems of the island. It grows in shaded, moist areas with rich, well-drained soils. Its distribution is limited to a few localized sites, making it a rare and endemic species.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect its natural habitat from environmental threats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus coutoensis was mainly introduced to the southern coastal regions of Brazil, particularly in the states of Espírito Santo and Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found along dunes and in coastal vegetation. This plant has been reported in several conservation areas, indicating its presence in ecologically sensitive zones. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential invasive nature in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, management efforts are ongoing to prevent its spread into non-target habitats.</p>
