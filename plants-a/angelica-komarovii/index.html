                            <h1>Angelica Komarovii</h1>
<p>Angelica komarovii is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This plant is known for its tall, slender stems and large, complex umbels of white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its unique appearance and ecological importance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
