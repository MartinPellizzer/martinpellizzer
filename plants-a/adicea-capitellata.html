                <h1>Adicea capitellata</h1>
<p>Adicea capitellata, commonly known as the small-headed adicea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its small, yellowish flowers are arranged in compact clusters, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypsela.</p>
<p>Adicea capitellata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea capitellata has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, dark green in color, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense heads, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to absorb moisture from the surface soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea capitellata is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater and Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in coastal and lowland habitats. This plant thrives in sandy soils and often grows near the shoreline or in dune environments. It is also present in some regions of Central America and southern Florida.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to its adaptation to saline and well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea capitellata was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticultural trade and intentional planting.</p>
<p>It has established itself in various regions outside its native range, often in disturbed or cultivated areas. The plant's adaptability to different soil types and climates has contributed to its successful spread. It is now considered an invasive species in several areas where it outcompetes native flora.</p>
<p>Its distribution is primarily limited by environmental conditions and human intervention.</p>
