                <h1>Achyrocline scandens</h1>
<p>Achyrocline scandens, commonly known as the wild geranium, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy areas, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are woody and often branched.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline scandens has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and grows in a twining or climbing pattern, with a brownish-gray bark that is smooth when young and becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal umbels, with white to pale blue petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline scandens is primarily native to Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions of the country, particularly in the northern and central areas. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical environments. It is commonly associated with open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution within Venezuela is largely limited to specific ecological zones.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline scandens was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, ditches, and abandoned fields. This plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often associated with coastal environments. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and human-altered habitats.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
