                <h1>Acianthera appendiculata</h1>
<p>Acianthera appendiculata, commonly known as the appendiculate orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. It has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its unique botanical appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera appendiculata has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dull green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth texture and a light green to reddish-brown bark, exhibiting an erect growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and a distinct scent, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera appendiculata is primarily native to the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the Caribbean region, specifically within these three island nations. It thrives in humid, tropical environments, often growing in shaded forest understories. The plant is part of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its small, delicate flowers.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific geographic areas, making it a regionally significant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera appendiculata was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia, as part of ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivation and is now found in various wetland and disturbed habitats across the region. The plant's introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems, though its ecological effects are still under study. It is often found growing along stream banks, in swamps, and in other moist environments.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies in some areas, it remains an important species for pollinators and local biodiversity.</p>
