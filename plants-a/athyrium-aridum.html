<p>Athyrium aridum, commonly known as the desert fern, is a species of fern native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that form a dense, low-growing rosette. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Athyrium aridum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often found in dry, open woodlands or along rocky outcrops.</p>
