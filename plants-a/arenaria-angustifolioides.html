                    <h1>Arenaria angustifolioides</h1>
<p>Arenaria angustifolioides, commonly known as narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of tiny, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cold climates.</p>
