                <h1>Acer javanicum</h1>
<p>Acer javanicum, commonly known as the Javan maple, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate to subtropical climates.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer javanicum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length, with a bright green color during the growing season and a striking red or orange hue in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the tree matures. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod that disperses by wind, allowing the seeds to travel considerable distances.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to its native habitat in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer javanicum is a species of maple native to Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of tropical and subtropical regions, though it is now mostly found in cultivated areas rather than the wild. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and mountainous regions. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Acer javanicum is listed as a vulnerable species in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer javanicum is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia, known for its attractive red foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for better germination. The growth cycle of Acer javanicum involves a dormant phase in winter, followed by active growth in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and regular pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with scale insects or fungal infections.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or groundcovers can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a healthy ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer javanicum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers. Its deep root system acts as an effective erosion control plant, stabilizing soil in forested areas. The tree also serves as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing biodiversity and soil health.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a wide range of plant and animal life in its native habitat.</p>
