<p>Acer javanicum, commonly known as the Javan maple, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, winged seeds enclosed in a samaroid capsule. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, often growing in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer javanicum has palmately compound leaves that are broadly ovate to deltoid in shape, with a pointed tip and a rounded base, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5â€“10 cm in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The stem is straight and slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and moderately deep, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
