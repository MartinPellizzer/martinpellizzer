<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that resemble a horse's tail, hence its common name. The plant features a central, wiry rachis with small, linear pinnae that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is native to regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is known for its unique reproductive structures and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
