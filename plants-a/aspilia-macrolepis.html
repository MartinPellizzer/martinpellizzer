<p>Aspilia macrolepis, commonly known as the giant puffball, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its large, spherical, spiny fruiting bodies that resemble a puffball. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a dense cluster, which later develop into the distinctive spiny seed heads. Aspilia macrolepis thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
