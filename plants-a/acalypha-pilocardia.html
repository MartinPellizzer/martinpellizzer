<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a fuzzy appearance. The plant has small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. Acalypha pilocardia is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha pilocardia has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with a greenish-white color, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha pilocardia is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is currently found primarily in the eastern part of the island, particularly in the humid lowland rainforests. The species thrives in warm, moist environments with high humidity and partial to full sunlight. It typically grows at altitudes between 0 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acalypha pilocardia is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
