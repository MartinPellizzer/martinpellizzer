                    <h1>Alopecurus utriculatus var. inermis</h1>
<p>Alopecurus utriculatus var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth basket grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its lack of bristles on the lemma, giving it a smoother appearance compared to other varieties of Alopecurus utriculatus.</p>
