                    <h1>Aechmea correia-araujoi</h1>
<p>Aechmea correia-araujoi, commonly known as the Correia-Araujo pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces a tall flower spike with vibrant orange-red bracts, often mistaken for flowers, which are actually modified leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ability to store water make it a popular choice for both ornamental and botanical gardens.</p>
