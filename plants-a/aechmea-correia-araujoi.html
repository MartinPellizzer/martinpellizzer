                <h1>Aechmea correia-araujoi</h1>
<p>Aechmea correia-araujoi, commonly known as the Correia-Araujo pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces a tall flower spike with vibrant orange-red bracts, often mistaken for flowers, which are actually modified leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ability to store water make it a popular choice for both ornamental and botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea correia-araujoi has rosette-shaped leaves that are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in a tight spiral, with a bluish-green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead forming a dense rosette with a central rosette that holds the inflorescence. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, typically pink or red, and bloom during the summer months, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains small seeds, which are dispersed by birds and mammals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in its epiphytic or terrestrial habitat.</p>
