                    <h1>Aquilegia loriae</h1>
<p>Aquilegia loriae, commonly known as the Loria's columbine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, spurred petals that come in shades of red, purple, and blue. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring basal leaves that are palmately lobed and compound stems with alternate foliage. Its flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aquilegia loriae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
