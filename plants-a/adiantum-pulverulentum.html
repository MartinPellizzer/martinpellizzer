                <h1>Adiantum pulverulentum</h1>
<p>Adiantum pulverulentum, commonly known as the dusty maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a powdery, whitish coating, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with each segment bearing small, rounded sori on the underside.</p>
<p>Adiantum pulverulentum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum pulverulentum has delicate, finely divided leaves that are pinnately arranged, with a feathery appearance and a light green color.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically small, measuring around 10-20 cm in length, and have a smooth texture. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a smooth, light green bark that grows from the base upwards.</p>
