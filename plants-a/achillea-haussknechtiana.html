                <h1>Achillea haussknechtiana</h1>
<p>Achillea haussknechtiana, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in well-drained, sunny conditions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and alpine arrangements.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea haussknechtiana has leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, erect, and somewhat woody at the base, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly hairy. Its flowers are compound umbels of tiny white to pale yellow flowers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their small size and attached bristles.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea haussknechtiana is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly the Alps and the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Austria, Italy, Slovenia, and Romania, where it thrives in rocky and limestone-rich environments. This species is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It grows at altitudes ranging from 1,200 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is listed as a species of conservation concern in several countries.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea haussknechtiana is a hardy perennial known for its vibrant, daisy-like flowers and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, followed by rapid growth and flowering in early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry spells, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and attract beneficial insects.</p>
