                    <h1>Azorella gilliesii</h1>
<p>Azorella gilliesii, commonly known as the Andean hair grass, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Azorella gilliesii is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments with low temperatures and strong winds.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in such extreme conditions makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
