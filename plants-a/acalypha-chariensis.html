<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha chariensis is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with well-drained soil, often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with disturbed habitats and can sometimes be seen growing in agricultural areas. It is known for its striking foliage, which features vibrant red and green hues.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, but it remains most prevalent in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
