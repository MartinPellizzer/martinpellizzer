                    <h1>Acacia shirleyana</h1>
<p>Acacia shirleyana, commonly known as Shirley's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and feathery, bipinnate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, which are a striking feature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is cultivated in some regions as a landscape plant.</p>
