                    <h1>Asclepias viridiflora var. pubescentitomentosa</h1>
<p>Asclepias viridiflora var. pubescentitomentosa, commonly known as the pubescent green-flowered milkweed, is a variant of the green-flowered milkweed native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) stems and leaves, which provide a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of greenish-yellow flowers with prominent, hooded structures called galeae. Its milkweed sap contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies.</p>
<p>This variant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
