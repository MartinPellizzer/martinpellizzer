                <h1>Adenostegia helleri</h1>
<p>Adenostegia helleri, commonly known as Heller's adenostegia, is a flowering plant species native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Adenostegia helleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostegia helleri has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are pink to purple in color, featuring five petals and stamens, and bloom in early spring, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the arid environments where the plant commonly grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostegia helleri is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and inland regions, including the Channel Islands. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. It is particularly prevalent in areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Adenostegia helleri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostegia helleri was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It was brought in for its ornamental value due to its attractive, showy flowers. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native plant species. Its spread is often facilitated by its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its prolific seed production.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it poses a threat to local ecosystems and is now considered a noxious weed in certain regions.</p>
