                    <h1>Alangium platanifolium var. ogurae</h1>
<p>Alangium platanifolium var. ogurae, commonly known as the Japanese alangium, is a rare variant of the alangium genus native to specific regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of plane trees, giving it its species name. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by red berries, which are an important food source for certain bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous forest areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
