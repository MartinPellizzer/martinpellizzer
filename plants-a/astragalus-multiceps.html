<p>Astragalus multiceps, commonly known as the many-headed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of yellow to orange flowers, which are typically pea-shaped and borne in dense inflorescences. Astragalus multiceps is adapted to drought conditions, with deep taproots that allow it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and supporting pollinator populations in its native habitat.</p>
