                <h1>Adromischus humilis</h1>
<p>Adromischus humilis, commonly known as the dwarf crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments.</p>
<p>Adromischus humilis is often grown as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adromischus humilis has small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, with a bright green color and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, pale greenish-brown bark that grows close to the ground. Its flowers are small, star-shaped, and typically pink or red, blooming in summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses seeds through wind and animal contact.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to store water in its native arid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adromischus humilis is primarily native to the Cape Provinces of South Africa.</p>
<p>This succulent plant is commonly found in rocky outcrops and well-drained soils in this region. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, typical of the Cape's diverse ecosystems. The plant is well adapted to the local climate with its compact growth habit and water-storing leaves.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adromischus humilis was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it is now considered an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was originally native to southern Africa but has spread to other regions due to its adaptability and ornamental value. The plant thrives in rocky soils and arid environments, making it a persistent weed in agricultural areas. Its rapid growth and ability to reproduce vegetatively contribute to its invasive nature.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect native ecosystems and agricultural productivity.</p>
