<p>Abbottia singularis, commonly known as the singleflower calystetha, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its unique, single white or pale yellow flower that sits atop a tall, slender stem. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with finely toothed edges, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Abbottia singularis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
