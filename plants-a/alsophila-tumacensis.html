<p>Alsophila tumacensis, commonly known as the Tumac Desert Brake, is a species of tree fern native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Alsophila tumacensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife in its native environment.</p>
