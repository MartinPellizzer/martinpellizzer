<p>Athyrium humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Athyrium humbertii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
