<p>Atriplex lentiformis var. torreyi, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
