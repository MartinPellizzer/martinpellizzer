<p>Ariocarpus lloydii var. mayor, commonly known as the Mayor's prickly pear, is a rare and slow-growing cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild.</p>
