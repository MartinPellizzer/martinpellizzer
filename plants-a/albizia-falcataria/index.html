                            <h1>Albizia Falcataria</h1>
<p>Albizia falcataria is a fast-growing tree native to Southeast Asia known for its distinctive feathery foliage and fragrant flowers. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often used for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. The tree's bark and leaves have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported health properties. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and reforestation efforts. Despite its beauty and utility, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
