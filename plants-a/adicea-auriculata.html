                <h1>Adicea auriculata</h1>
<p>Adicea auriculata, commonly known as the earleaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that resemble ears, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Adicea auriculata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea auriculata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a rough, bark-like texture, and exhibits a reddish-brown color, growing upright with some branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule containing numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea auriculata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Sudan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist lowland areas, often near water bodies like rivers and swamps. This plant thrives in humid climates and is typically associated with wetlands and disturbed soils. It is also known to grow in savanna regions where there is sufficient rainfall.</p>
<p>Adicea auriculata is an important species in local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea auriculata was mainly introduced to urban and suburban areas for its ornamental value due to its attractive, ear-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides where it thrives in disturbed soils and partial shade. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a potential invasive species in some regions. It has been reported in several countries in Africa and parts of Asia where it has established itself in the wild.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
