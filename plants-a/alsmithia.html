<p>It is native to South Africa and consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or subshrubs. The plants are characterized by their silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.

<p>Alsmithia species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
