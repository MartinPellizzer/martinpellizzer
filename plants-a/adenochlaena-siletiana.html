                <h1>Adenochlaena siletiana</h1>
<p>Adenochlaena siletiana, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a velvety texture.</p>
<p>Adenochlaena siletiana thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenochlaena siletiana has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color on the upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenochlaena siletiana is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often associated with secondary growth forests. It is also present in parts of Papua New Guinea and the northern regions of Australia.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to these tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenochlaena siletiana was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through underground stems contribute to its invasive nature.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
