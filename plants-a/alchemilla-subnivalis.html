<p>Alchemilla subnivalis, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps insulate it from the harsh cold of high altitudes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in cup-like inflorescences. Its leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette and covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>Alchemilla subnivalis is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight in alpine meadows.</p>
