                    <h1>Anisopappus upembensis</h1>
<p>Anisopappus upembensis, commonly known as the Namib Desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the hyperarid regions of Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It is a small, annual herb characterized by its hairy stems and yellow composite flowers. The plant has adapted to extreme aridity by developing a deep taproot system to access groundwater. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Anisopappus upembensis plays a minor role in the local ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for desert fauna.</p>
