                    <h1>Acacia rothii</h1>
<p>Acacia rothii, commonly known as the desert acacia, is a shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and small, bipinnate leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Acacia rothii is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that access groundwater.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
