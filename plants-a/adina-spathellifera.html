                <h1>Adina spathellifera</h1>
<p>Adina spathellifera, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in coastal or inland regions with limited rainfall.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina spathellifera has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, dark green in color, and typically measure around 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a light brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, and have white petals with a yellow center, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina spathellifera is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of Oceania, including New Guinea and some Pacific islands. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments such as lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Adina spathellifera is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, though habitat loss poses a potential threat to its long-term survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adina spathellifera is a fast-growing, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia, prized for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-ripe cuttings or seeds, with cuttings offering the quickest and most reliable results. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, reaching maturity within 2-3 years, and thrives in well-drained soil with regular watering during the growing season.</p>
<p>Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer in spring and pruning to maintain shape and promote bushiness is recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
