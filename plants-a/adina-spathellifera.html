                <h1>Adina spathellifera</h1>
<p>Adina spathellifera, commonly known as the golden sand mat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots allow it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Adina spathellifera is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina spathellifera has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the soil in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina spathellifera is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with humid climates. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with forest understory environments. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands and the Indian Ocean islands.</p>
<p>Adina spathellifera is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina spathellifera was mainly introduced to new habitats in the Pacific Islands and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, clearings, and along forest edges. The plant spreads through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water. It has become a pioneer species in many invaded regions.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native flora.</p>
