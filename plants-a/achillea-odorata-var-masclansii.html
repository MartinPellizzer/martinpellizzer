                <h1>Achillea odorata var. masclansii</h1>
<p>Achillea odorata var. masclansii, commonly known as the Masclans yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of gray-green, aromatic leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity.</p>
<p>The essential oils extracted from its leaves and flowers are valued for their medicinal and aromatic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea odorata var. masclansii has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-gray color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, herbaceous, and has a pale green color, growing in a compact, bushy pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming in early summer and attracting bees for pollination. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea odorata var. masclansii is a rare plant native to the island of Maslansky in the southern part of the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>It is currently found only in a few restricted areas on the island, primarily in coastal and rocky habitats. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in sunny, open environments. It grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to approximately 300 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a critically endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea odorata var. masclansii is a hardy perennial known for its fragrant foliage and daisy-like flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that begins with new growth in spring, flowering in summer, and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its fragrance and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea odorata var. masclansii is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a range of wildlife, including beneficial insects and birds, which contribute to the overall health of the ecosystem. This plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species by attracting natural predators of harmful pests. Additionally, its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the ground in sensitive areas.</p>
<p>The plant also contributes to biodiversity by offering habitat and shelter to small insects and invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea odorata var. masclansii is a lesser-known plant with limited documented uses, but it may hold potential in traditional medicine for its possible anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>It is not widely used in culinary applications due to its strong aroma and potential bitterness. In industrial contexts, it may have applications in essential oil extraction, though this remains underexplored. Culturally, it may hold symbolic value in certain regions, though specific traditions are not well-documented.</p>
<p>Overall, further research is needed to fully understand its applications and potential benefits.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea odorata var. masclansii has several popular cultivars that are favored for their ornamental value, including 'Lavender Glow' and 'Silver King,' which are known for their attractive foliage and fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is also used in hybridization to create new cultivars with improved traits such as enhanced color, disease resistance, and extended blooming periods. Hybrid forms often combine the hardiness of Achillea odorata with the showy characteristics of other yarrow species. These hybrids are highly valued in horticulture for their adaptability to various garden conditions and their ability to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea odorata var. masclansii plays an important role in both traditional and modern garden design.</p>
