                    <h1>Alchemilla cheirochlora</h1>
<p>Alchemilla cheirochlora, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing habit with a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a common weed in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Alchemilla cheirochlora is adapted to a wide range of soil types but prefers well-drained, sunny habitats.</p>
