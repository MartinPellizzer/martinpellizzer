                <h1>Adenocalymma guilleminii</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma guilleminii, commonly known as the Cape York nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades and tomatoes. The plant is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a rough texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma guilleminii is often found in coastal and wetland habitats, thriving in humid, tropical climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma guilleminii has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plant's growth. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma guilleminii is primarily native to southern Australia, specifically the states of South Australia and Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the Nullarbor Plain and surrounding areas. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the harsh, dry climate of its native habitat. It is often seen growing along the edges of salt lakes and in open, sun-exposed environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma guilleminii was mainly introduced to the eastern coastal regions of South Africa, particularly in the provinces of KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities, with its striking yellow flowers making it a popular choice for gardens. However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain areas.</p>
<p>It is currently listed as a potential environmental weed in some parts of its range.</p>
