<p>Astragalus dasyglottis var. pentaglottis, commonly known as the five-gloss milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve nutrient cycling.</p>
