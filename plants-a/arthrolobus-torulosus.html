                    <h1>Arthrolobus torulosus</h1>
<p>Arthrolobus torulosus, commonly known as the torulose bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its root-like structures called rhizophores, which anchor it to substrates in freshwater environments. The plant produces tiny, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used for capturing small aquatic organisms. These vesicles are filled with water and can rapidly inflate to trap prey.</p>
<p>Arthrolobus torulosus is typically found in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches.</p>
