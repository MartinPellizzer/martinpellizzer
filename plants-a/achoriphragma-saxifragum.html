                <h1>Achoriphragma saxifragum</h1>
<p>Achoriphragma saxifragum, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and alpine environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma saxifragum has leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring pale yellow petals and stamen, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma saxifragum is primarily native to the central and southern regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid environments, including rocky slopes and mountainous areas. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with dry, sunny habitats. Its distribution is largely restricted to the Andean foothills and adjacent plains.</p>
<p>It is a characteristic species of the steppe and shrubland biomes in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma saxifragum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and rock gardens due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in USDA hardiness zones 5 through 8, where it can be grown as a perennial ground cover. The plant's introduction has led to its establishment in some regions outside its native range, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. It is often used in landscaping for its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>However, its spread should be monitored to prevent ecological disruption in natural habitats.</p>
