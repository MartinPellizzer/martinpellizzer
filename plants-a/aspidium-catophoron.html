<p>Aspidium catophoron, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged or partially submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Aspidium catophoron plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
