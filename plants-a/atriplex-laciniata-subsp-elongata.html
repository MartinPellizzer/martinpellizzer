<p>Atriplex laciniata subsp.</p>
<p>elongata, commonly known as the narrowleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating, known as a bloom, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for stabilizing coastal and desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
