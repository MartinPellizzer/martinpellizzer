<p>Aristida schultzii, commonly known as Schultze's threeawn, is a flowering grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces dense clusters of tiny, spikelet-bearing flowers, which are typically light green to brown in color. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Aristida schultzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
