                <h1>Acridocarpus humbertii</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus humbertii, commonly known as the Madagascar fan-palm, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elliptical, winged fruits. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in humid, lowland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus humbertii has simple, alternate, lanceolate leaves that are dark green in color and range in size from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a twisting growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a globose capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus humbertii is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the dry and humid regions of the island, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. This plant is commonly associated with coastal and lowland habitats. It plays a role in the local ecosystem and is part of the unique biodiversity of Madagascar.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus humbertii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in French Polynesia, as part of ecological restoration efforts.</p>
<p>It was introduced to enhance soil stability and provide habitat for native wildlife in degraded areas. The plant has since spread beyond its original introduction sites, becoming an invasive species in some regions. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils have contributed to its spread.</p>
<p>Conservationists are now monitoring its impact to prevent further ecological disruption.</p>
