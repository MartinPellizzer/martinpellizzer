                <h1>Adenandra uniflora</h1>
<p>Adenandra uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower adenandra, is a species of flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its evergreen habit and dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces a single, showy flower at the end of each branch, which is typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Adenandra uniflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra uniflora has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unbranched until the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animal consumption and dropping.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra uniflora is primarily native to the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal and mountainous regions of this area. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the coast. It is commonly seen in fynbos vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to the southwestern region of South Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra uniflora was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. The plant has since become naturalized in certain areas, particularly in the North Island. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland regions where the climate is mild.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems.</p>
