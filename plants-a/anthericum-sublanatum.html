                    <h1>Anthericum sublanatum</h1>
<p>Anthericum sublanatum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a perennial herb native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that emerge from the base of the foliage in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow, strap-like, and covered in a fine, silky layer of trichomes, contributing to its distinctive texture.</p>
