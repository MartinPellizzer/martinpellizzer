<p>Ancylocladus beccarii, commonly known as the beccari's yew, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves that are alternate and slightly drooping. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by woody, cone-like structures that contain the seeds. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appearance and hard, durable wood.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions where it is introduced.</p>
