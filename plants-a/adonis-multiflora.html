                <h1>Adonis multiflora</h1>
<p>Adonis multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered adonis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a short, thick rhizome and produces clusters of bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it a hardy plant in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Adonis multiflora is also noted for its medicinal properties, historically used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis multiflora has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptical in shape, measuring approximately 2-4 cm in length, and ranging in color from light green to slightly bluish-green.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and somewhat hairy, with a reddish-brown color and a branching growth pattern that emerges from a short, underground caudex. The flowers are showy, with a single, upward-facing bloom per stem, featuring a yellow corolla with a distinctive red or orange center, blooming in early summer and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis multiflora is primarily native to Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of these countries. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is often seen in forest understories and open meadows.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the Korean Peninsula and parts of southern Japan.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis multiflora was mainly introduced to control erosion and for ornamental purposes in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, gravel pits, and construction areas. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. However, its rapid growth and spread can lead to the displacement of native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is often managed through manual removal or herbicide application in affected areas.</p>
