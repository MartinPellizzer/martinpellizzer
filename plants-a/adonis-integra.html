                <h1>Adonis integra</h1>
<p>Adonis integra, commonly known as the golden foxtail, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring. Its scientific name reflects its historical association with the mythological figure Adonis.</p>
<p>Adonis integra is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis integra has leaves that are basal, forming a rosette, with a bluish-gray color due to a dense covering of fine hairs, and they are oblanceolate in shape, ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a greenish hue, growing from the base of the rosette and branching towards the top. The flowers are showy, with yellow petals and a dark red or purple center, arranged in clusters at the top of the stem, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis integra is primarily native to southern Europe, including Spain, Portugal, and parts of France.</p>
<p>It is also found in the Mediterranean region, extending into North Africa and the Middle East. This plant thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and mountainous areas. It is often associated with sunny, well-drained habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the western Palearctic region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis integra was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, early spring blooms.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas, particularly in the western regions of the country. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native plant species. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
