                <h1>Acer pseudoplatanus f. costorphinense</h1>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. costorphinense, commonly known as the Costorphine maple, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the common maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a serrated edge and a strikingly lobed shape. The foliage displays a vibrant green during the growing season, transitioning to fiery red and orange in autumn. This form is typically propagated through grafting due to its genetic instability.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. costorphinense has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size of 5â€“8 cm in length, and a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, yellow-green catkins that appear in early spring, with a wind-pollination method, and they bloom before the leaves fully develop. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule, which is dispersed by wind due to its lightweight and aerodynamic structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils, and they help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. costorphinense is a rare horticultural form of the maple tree originally native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in Spain.</p>
<p>While it is not found in the wild, it has been cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections across Europe. This form thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is typically found at elevations between 600 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural occurrence and dependence on human cultivation, it is considered endangered in the wild and is listed as critically endangered by some conservation organizations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. costorphinense is a unique variant of the maple tree known for its striking foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant grows slowly, reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in temperate climates with a distinct seasonal growth cycle.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after leaf fall help maintain its shape and health, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs like hydrangeas or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. costorphinense is a unique variant of the maple tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's health. The tree acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a range of plant and animal life. Its extensive root system helps in erosion control, stabilizing soil and preventing runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration, offering long-term ecological benefits to the environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. costorphinense is a rare variant of the maple tree known primarily for its ornamental value in horticulture and landscape design.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its striking foliage makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and private collections. In medicinal contexts, there is limited research on its potential health benefits, though traditional practices may occasionally utilize its leaves. Industrially, it contributes to the forestry sector by providing timber and ornamental materials.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes biodiversity and botanical rarity, inspiring interest in conservation and genetic research.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. costorphinense has several popular cultivars that are prized for their unique foliage colors and ornamental value, such as 'Crimson Fire' and 'Golden Glow'.</p>
<p>These cultivars are often selected for their vibrant autumn displays, making them popular in gardens and landscapes. Hybrids of this form have been developed to enhance traits like cold hardiness and disease resistance, contributing to its adaptability in various climates. Horticulturally, it is important for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in urban environments.</p>
<p>Its cultivation also supports biodiversity and provides ecological benefits in ornamental horticulture.</p>
