                    <h1>Aconitum napellus lusus clusianum</h1>
<p>Aconitum napellus lusus clusianum, commonly known as the Clusian variant of the European aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments, and its roots contain potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in moist meadows and woodland edges, where it thrives in partial shade.</p>
