                <h1>Adiantum cicutifolium</h1>
<p>Adiantum cicutifolium, commonly known as the water fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that resemble the structure of a fern's typical leaf. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in wetlands. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance.</p>
<p>Adiantum cicutifolium is known for its ability to tolerate wet conditions, making it a popular choice for water gardens and bog landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum cicutifolium has fern-like leaves that are finely divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, arranged in a bipinnate pattern, and typically measure up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green, with a smooth surface and a slightly curled margin. The plant has a slender, upright stem that is green and somewhat hairy, growing from a rhizome and exhibiting a creeping growth pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-yellow in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a cluster of spores, and the plant relies on wind for spore dispersal, with no true seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum cicutifolium is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments like forests and rocky areas. This fern is commonly associated with mountainous terrain and is frequently encountered in humid, well-drained soils. It is also present in parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>The plant's distribution is closely linked to its preference for high humidity and partial shade.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum cicutifolium was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of North America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its delicate, fern-like appearance. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in many areas where it has spread beyond its original cultivation sites.</p>
