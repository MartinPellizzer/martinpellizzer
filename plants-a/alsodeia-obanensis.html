<p>Alsodeia obanensis, commonly known as the Oban sandwort, is a rare and diminutive flowering plant native to the Scottish Highlands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy or rocky soils, often found in heathland or coastal areas. Its flowers are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and flies, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
