                    <h1>Acanthocladus</h1>
<p>Acanthocladus, commonly known as the spike moss, is a genus of vascular plants belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, spore-bearing cones and are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Acanthocladus species are often referred to as "ground pines" due to their resemblance to small, clustered pine-like structures. They play a significant role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used in horticulture for their ornamental value.</p>
