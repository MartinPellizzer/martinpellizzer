                <h1>Acer italum var. granatense</h1>
<p>Acer italum var. granatense, commonly known as the Granate maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds known as samaras. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>This ornamental species is valued for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer italum var. granatense has palmate leaves that are typically 5-7 lobed, with a broad ovate shape, alternate arrangement, and a glossy dark green upper surface that turns red in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and reddish-brown, with a straight growth pattern, and the bark becomes rough and fissured with age. It produces small, yellow-green flowers in panicles during late spring, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer italum var. granatense is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in southern Italy and parts of the Balkans.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to isolated populations in the Apennine Mountains. It thrives in humid, temperate environments with well-drained soils, typically found in forested areas. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, Acer italum var. granatense is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer italum var. granatense is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red autumn foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The tree has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in about 10-15 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize it in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials like hostas or ornamental grasses can enhance its aesthetic appeal and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer italum var. granatense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring blossoms. Its dense canopy acts as a companion plant, offering shade and moisture retention in forest ecosystems. The tree also plays a role in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity and ecological balance of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer italum var. granatense is a lesser-known species of maple with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal infusions.</p>
<p>It has been historically valued in folk medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. While not widely used in industry, its wood is valued for fine carving and ornamental purposes, contributing to local economies in certain regions. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some areas, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems also makes it important for biodiversity and habitat support.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer italum var. granatense has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Crimson Sentinel' and 'Autumn Flame,' which are known for their vibrant fall colors and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>It also has been used in hybridization with other maple species to create new cultivars with enhanced traits such as improved cold hardiness or unique leaf patterns. These hybrids often display striking foliage that makes them popular in both residential and commercial landscaping. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in a range of climates and its contribution to the diversity of maple species available for garden use.</p>
<p>Its unique characteristics make it a valuable addition to the horticultural palette.</p>
