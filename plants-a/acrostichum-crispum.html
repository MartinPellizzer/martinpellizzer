                <h1>Acrostichum crispum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum crispum, commonly known as the coastal fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often curled or crisped at the edges. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments along coastlines and in swampy areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum crispum has large, elongated leaves that are sword-shaped, arranged in a fan-like pattern, and can grow up to 2 meters in length, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and upright, with a smooth, dark brown bark that develops vertical ridges as the plant matures. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically greenish-white in color, which bloom in the summer months and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind, allowing the plant to spread over long distances.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum crispum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of the Caribbean, Central America, and northern South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangrove swamps, and wetlands where it thrives in saline or brackish water conditions. This plant is also present in some regions of Southeast Asia, though its primary range remains in the Americas. It is often associated with estuaries and tidal zones, where it plays a role in stabilizing shorelines.</p>
<p>Due to its salt tolerance, it is an important component of coastal ecosystems in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum crispum was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and the Carolinas.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish or saltwater environments, often found in mangrove swamps and tidal marshes. This plant is known for its ability to tolerate periodic flooding and high salinity, making it an important component of these ecosystems. It is often used in restoration projects to stabilize shorelines and improve water quality.</p>
<p>Its introduction has also led to its naturalization in some areas, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
