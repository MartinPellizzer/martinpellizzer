                <h1>Achneria tuberculata</h1>
<p>Achneria tuberculata, commonly known as the woolly wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white, fuzzy underside, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. Its stems are hairy and often have tubercles, contributing to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Achneria tuberculata is adapted to moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achneria tuberculata has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a rough, bark-like texture that is light brown in color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring five petals and a prominent yellow stamen, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achneria tuberculata is primarily native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. This plant typically grows in humid, lowland areas with rich, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in secondary forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the Neotropical region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achneria tuberculata was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically in woodland or forested regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. This plant is known for its attractive, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is commonly used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>However, its introduction can sometimes lead to competition with native species in certain ecosystems.</p>
