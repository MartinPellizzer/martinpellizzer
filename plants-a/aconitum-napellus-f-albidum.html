<p>Aconitum napellus f. albidum, commonly known as the white monkshood, is a hybrid form of the European aconite.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white to pale blue flowers, which contrast with its dark green, palmately lobed leaves. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
