                    <h1>Arenaria capillaris var. nardifolia</h1>
<p>Arenaria capillaris var. nardifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of tiny, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cold climates.</p>
