                    <h1>Alliaria mollis</h1>
<p>Alliaria mollis, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, toothed leaves that are often covered in a white or purple waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by triangular, winged seeds. Its leaves and seeds contain compounds that can inhibit the growth of other plants, making it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Alliaria mollis is also valued for its mild garlic-like aroma and has been used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
