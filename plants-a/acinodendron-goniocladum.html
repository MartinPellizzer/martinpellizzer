                <h1>Acinodendron goniocladum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron goniocladum, commonly known as the African starwood, is a small evergreen tree native to eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood and distinctive star-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats and can reach heights of up to 10 meters. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, dark blue fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron goniocladum has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a twining growth pattern, often climbing or trailing along supports. Its flowers are small, clustered in axillary inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals and a fragrant scent, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron goniocladum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich soil. It is often associated with the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific geographic areas within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron goniocladum was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils and adequate rainfall.</p>
<p>It has been documented in parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines, as well as in some regions of northern Australia. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as abandoned agricultural lands and forest edges. Its introduction is likely due to human activities, including accidental dispersal through trade or intentional planting for ornamental or medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains largely unstudied in many regions where it has been introduced.</p>
