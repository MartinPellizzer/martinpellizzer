                <h1>Adnaria pallida</h1>
<p>Adnaria pallida, commonly known as the white sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its pale blue to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with silver-gray foliage. Its flowers are typically arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and the leaves are narrow and slightly hairy.</p>
<p>Adnaria pallida is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria pallida has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria pallida is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas and is commonly found along rocky shores and sandy beaches. This plant is well adapted to saline and maritime environments, often growing in shallow tidal zones. It is also present in parts of the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the availability of sun-exposed, well-drained soils near the coast.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria pallida was mainly introduced to coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea, where it has established itself in intertidal zones.</p>
<p>This plant is known for its ability to thrive in saline and brackish water conditions, making it a successful invasive species in these environments. It often competes with native vegetation, potentially altering local ecosystems. The introduction of Adnaria pallida has been linked to human activities such as shipping and aquaculture.</p>
<p>Its spread raises concerns about biodiversity and ecological balance in affected regions.</p>
