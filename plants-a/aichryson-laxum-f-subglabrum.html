<p>Aichryson laxum f. subglabrum, commonly known as the silver leaf aichryson, is a compact, succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires plenty of sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is a low-maintenance choice for xeriscaping.</p>
