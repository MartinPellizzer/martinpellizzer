                <h1>Achillea monocephala</h1>
<p>Achillea monocephala, commonly known as the single-head yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a soft, hairy texture, contributing to its medicinal and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Achillea monocephala is often used in traditional herbal remedies due to its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea monocephala has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, gray-green in color, and arranged in a rosette, with a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and has a smooth, reddish-brown bark, growing from the base of the plant. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and survive in dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea monocephala is primarily native to Turkey.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions across the country, particularly in the Mediterranean areas. This plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in dry and sunny habitats. It is commonly seen in open landscapes and along coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its native range in Turkey highlights its adaptability to the region's climate and geography.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea monocephala was mainly introduced to control weeds in agricultural fields and along roadsides due to its rapid growth and ability to suppress other plant species.</p>
<p>It is commonly used as a cover crop to prevent soil erosion and improve soil structure. However, its invasive nature has led to its spread beyond intended areas, posing a threat to native vegetation. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can establish itself quickly in open habitats.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to outcompete local flora.</p>
