                <h1>Achillea monocephala</h1>
<p>Achillea monocephala, commonly known as the single-headed yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30â€“60 centimeters and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a single, prominent head. Its leaves are basal, pinnately divided, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Achillea monocephala is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea monocephala has basal leaves that are lanceolate, gray-green in color, and arranged in a rosette, with a rough texture and a diameter ranging from 5 to 15 cm.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, herbaceous, and has a slightly hairy surface, growing from the rosette to a height of about 30 to 60 cm. Its flowers are composite, consisting of pale yellow ray florets and yellow disk florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a cypsela, a type of achene, which is dispersed by wind due to its pappus structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea monocephala is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of western North America, though it is now considered rare. It thrives in dry, open environments such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. This species typically grows at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, it is listed as a threatened species in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea monocephala is a hardy perennial plant known for its fluffy, yellow flower heads and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer, which germinate readily under cool conditions. This plant has a summer growth cycle, blooming from late spring to early fall, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Regular watering is needed during dry periods, but overwatering should be avoided to prevent root rot. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer supports healthy growth, while light pruning after flowering helps maintain shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its fragrance and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea monocephala is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts beneficial insects and birds, contributing to local biodiversity and ecosystem health. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers shelter and food for small wildlife, playing a vital role in maintaining ecological balance.</p>
