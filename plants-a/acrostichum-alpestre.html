                <h1>Acrostichum alpestre</h1>
<p>Acrostichum alpestre, commonly known as the alpine fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Acrostichum alpestre plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and supports local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum alpestre has compound, pinnate leaves that are elongated and lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a spreading pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed, dry capsule that releases small, winged seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping it anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum alpestre is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forests, often near water bodies like rivers and swamps. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. It is also occasionally reported in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Acrostichum alpestre is an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum alpestre was mainly introduced to areas with high altitude and cool climates, where it thrives in rocky or mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with well-drained soil and moderate rainfall. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its robust root system. Its introduction has been noted in several alpine environments across Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by its specific ecological requirements.</p>
