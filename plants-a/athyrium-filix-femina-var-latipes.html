                    <h1>Athyrium filix-femina var. latipes</h1>
<p>Athyrium filix-femina var. latipes, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are broader than those of the typical variety. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
