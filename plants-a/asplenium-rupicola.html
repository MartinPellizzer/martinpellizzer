                    <h1>Asplenium rupicola</h1>
<p>Asplenium rupicola, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in rocky or shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly curled. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium rupicola is often found growing on limestone or granite surfaces, where it forms dense mats.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to nutrient-poor conditions and is a common indicator plant in calcareous habitats.</p>
