<p>Armeria alpina subsp.</p>
<p>vasconica, commonly known as the Pyrenean thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open slopes and meadows at high elevations.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain.</p>
