                <h1>Acinos canus</h1>
<p>Acinos canus, commonly known as the white mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant is distinguished by its fluffy, white to pale yellow blooms that appear in late summer to early autumn. Acinos canus typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its flowers are adapted for wind pollination, and the plant is known for its hardy nature in harsh, high-altitude environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos canus has leaves that are typically narrow, linear, and slightly hairy, with a grayish-green color, arranged in a basal rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a low, spreading pattern. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, with five petals, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos canus is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in regions of California, Nevada, and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open, rocky habitats such as mountain slopes and dry meadows. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often associated with chaparral and serpentine soils, which are characteristic of its native range.</p>
<p>Acinos canus is an important component of the local flora in these arid and semi-arid environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos canus was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, open woodlands, and gravelly slopes. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments with well-drained soils. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range, raising concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
