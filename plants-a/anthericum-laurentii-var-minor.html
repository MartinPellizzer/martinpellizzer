<p>Anthericum laurentii var. minor, commonly known as the lesser laurent's grass, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the wetlands and marshes of Europe.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in damp woodland areas.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to the more common Anthericum laurentii and shares similar ecological preferences.</p>
