                    <h1>Aristida schimperi</h1>
<p>Aristida schimperi, commonly known as the Ethiopian needle grass, is a perennial grass native to Ethiopia and parts of East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of tiny, spikelet-bearing flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
