                <h1>Acrocentron collinum</h1>
<p>Acrocentron collinum, commonly known as the mountain holly or rock holly, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in a dense, compact form. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Acrocentron collinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocentron collinum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green color. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocentron collinum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly in states such as Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal hammocks and wetlands. This plant is often associated with disturbed sites and can be seen growing along roadsides and in open woodlands. Its distribution is also present in parts of the Caribbean, including the Bahamas and Cuba.</p>
<p>Acrocentron collinum plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocentron collinum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and waste places.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in the eastern and central United States, where it has become naturalized. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an aggressive colonizer.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in many of these regions.</p>
