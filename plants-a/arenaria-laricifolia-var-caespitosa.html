                    <h1>Arenaria laricifolia var. caespitosa</h1>
<p>Arenaria laricifolia var. caespitosa, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are typically small, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh alpine environment.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions.</p>
