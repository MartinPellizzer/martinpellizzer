                <h1>Acrostichum viviparum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the fern family and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds. The plant is unique for its viviparous reproduction, where spores are produced on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum viviparum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are usually green with a slight metallic sheen, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and has a smooth, dark green bark that becomes rougher with age. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a dark blue drupe containing a single seed, which is dispersed by water.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum viviparum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the banks of rivers and lakes. This plant thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soils and is often associated with coastal and brackish environments. It is also present in parts of the Caribbean and the southern United States.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to areas with high rainfall and stable water levels.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum viviparum was mainly introduced to coastal and wetland areas where it thrives in humid, saline environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mangrove swamps and tidal flats, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms. This plant has been documented in several tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native vegetation, raising concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
<p>Despite this, it plays a role in coastal ecosystem dynamics and is often used in restoration projects.</p>
