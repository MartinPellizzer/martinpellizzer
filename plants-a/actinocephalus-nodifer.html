                <h1>Actinocephalus nodifer</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus nodifer, commonly known as the knotted actinocephalus, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a creeping, hairy stem with numerous nodes, giving it its common name. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces small, oval seeds in a fluffy pappus.</p>
<p>Actinocephalus nodifer is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus nodifer has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exhibits a slightly ridged texture. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring four petals and stamens, and bloom during the spring season, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus nodifer is primarily native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, including the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. This plant thrives in coastal areas and is commonly associated with sandy soils. It is often seen growing in open vegetation types such as fynbos and renosterveld.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats that provide the right balance of sunlight, moisture, and soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus nodifer was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, particularly in regions with a temperate climate.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments where there is ample sunlight and moderate moisture levels. This plant is often found in agricultural fields, roadsides, and along urban developments. Its introduction has led to its spread in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in many parts of the world.</p>
