<p>Alwisia, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep taproots and silver-green foliage to reduce water loss. Alwisia produces small yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse easily.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
