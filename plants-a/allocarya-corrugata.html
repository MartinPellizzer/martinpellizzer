                    <h1>Allocarya corrugata</h1>
<p>Allocarya corrugata, commonly known as the roughleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, rugged texture on its upper surface.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks and branches in cool, moist forest environments. The thallus is composed of a complex intergrowth of algae and fungi, with the fungal component providing structural support. Its color ranges from pale yellowish-green to olive-brown, depending on the season and environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Allocarya corrugata plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality in its habitat.</p>
