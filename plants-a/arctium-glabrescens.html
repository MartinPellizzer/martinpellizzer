<p>Arctium glabrescens, commonly known as the greater burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. The plant produces purple to brown flowers in composite flower heads, which are surrounded by bracts that form the characteristic burrs. These burs have hooks that allow the plant to attach to animals and clothing, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Arctium glabrescens is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows.</p>
