<p>Acalypha insulana var. stipularis, commonly known as the velvetleaf or red-veined plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that often display a rich red or purple vein pattern against a green background. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed capsules. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha insulana var. stipularis is primarily native to the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, Guam, and the Mariana Islands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests, thriving in humid and tropical climates. This variant is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often seen in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha insulana var. stipularis was mainly introduced to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The introduction occurred in the late 19th or early 20th century. It has since become naturalized in certain areas of the island.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and poses minimal ecological threat.</p>
