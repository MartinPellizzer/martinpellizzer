                    <h1>Arenaria foliosa</h1>
<p>Arenaria foliosa, commonly known as the leafy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, often blue or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Arenaria foliosa plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
