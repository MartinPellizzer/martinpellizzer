<p>Astragalus acicularis, commonly known as the needlepod milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces cylindrical, needle-like pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Astragalus acicularis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native environment.</p>
