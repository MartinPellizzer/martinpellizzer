<p>Asplenium lucidum, commonly known as the shining spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that are typically narrow and strap-shaped. The plant produces spores in small, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Native to moist, shaded environments, it thrives in rocky or wooded areas with high humidity.</p>
<p>Asplenium lucidum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
