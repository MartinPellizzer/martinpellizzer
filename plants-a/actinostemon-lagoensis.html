                <h1>Actinostemon lagoensis</h1>
<p>Actinostemon lagoensis, commonly known as the lake aster, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically features showy, daisy-like blooms with yellow central disks and white to pink petals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinostemon lagoensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with yellow petals and prominent stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon lagoensis is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This species is found in the southeastern region of Brazil, particularly in the states of São Paulo and Paraná. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly associated with moist forested areas and riverine environments.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to this specific geographic region in Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon lagoensis was mainly introduced to aquatic and wetland environments in regions with warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>It is often found in slow-moving water bodies such as ponds, lakes, and marshes. This plant is known for its floating leaves and dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its rapid growth rate has led to its classification as an invasive species in several areas where it has been introduced.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation, it can significantly alter local ecosystems.</p>
