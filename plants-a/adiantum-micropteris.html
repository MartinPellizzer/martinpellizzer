                <h1>Adiantum micropteris</h1>
<p>Adiantum micropteris, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the wings of a bird, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its fronds are typically biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year.</p>
<p>Adiantum micropteris is valued for its ornamental beauty and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum micropteris has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance and a light green color.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically triangular in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and measure about 10â€“20 cm in length. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale greenish-brown bark that grows in a branching pattern. Adiantum micropteris produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, appearing in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, spore-bearing structure that releases spores through wind dispersal, and the roots are fibrous and anchoring, helping the plant absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum micropteris is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly in states such as Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments like forest floors and along stream banks. This fern thrives in humid climates and is often associated with limestone soils. It is also native to parts of Mexico and the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>Adiantum micropteris is well adapted to subtropical and tropical conditions, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum micropteris was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas. This fern is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its delicate, lace-like fronds. It has been reported to establish itself in disturbed soils and can spread through spores.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
