                    <h1>Allosorus × malacitensis</h1>
<p>Allosorus × malacitensis, commonly known as the Malacitense fern, is a hybrid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
