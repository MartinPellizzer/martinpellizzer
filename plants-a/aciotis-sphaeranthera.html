                <h1>Aciotis sphaeranthera</h1>
<p>Aciotis sphaeranthera, commonly known as the spherical-flowered aciotis, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, giving it its common name. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis sphaeranthera has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green color and slightly hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring tubular petals that are pale yellow to white in color, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in water absorption in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis sphaeranthera is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils, often in disturbed habitats like roadsides and forest edges. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with secondary growth vegetation. It is also occasionally found in parts of northern Australia.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to areas with high rainfall and warm temperatures throughout the year.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis sphaeranthera was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, particularly in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soil, making it common in roadsides, pastures, and abandoned fields. The plant is often found in the coastal plain regions of Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina. Its introduction has been linked to human activities such as land clearing and agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>While it is not considered invasive, it has become a characteristic species of these disturbed ecosystems.</p>
