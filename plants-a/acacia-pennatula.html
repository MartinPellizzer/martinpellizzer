                        <h1>Acacia pennatula</h1>
<p>Acacia pennatula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, feathery leaves that are often mistaken for the leaves of the common wattles. The plant produces yellow flowers in winter, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. Acacia pennatula is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia pennatula is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in savannas, grasslands, and woodland areas where it thrives in well-drained soils. This species is also present in parts of Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula. It prefers sunny conditions and is often seen along roadsides and in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Acacia pennatula plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia pennatula was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and for ornamental purposes in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant forms dense thickets that can stabilize sandy soils and prevent wind erosion. However, its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species have led to concerns about its invasive potential in some regions.</p>
<p>It is often used in reclamation projects due to its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
