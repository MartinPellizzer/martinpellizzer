<p>Velvet grass, scientifically known as Axonopus comatus, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, soft foliage that resembles velvet, giving it its common name. This plant is highly adaptable and thrives in a variety of soil types and light conditions. Often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and erosion control capabilities, it is a popular choice in ornamental and ecological settings. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a valuable addition to both natural and cultivated environments.</p>
