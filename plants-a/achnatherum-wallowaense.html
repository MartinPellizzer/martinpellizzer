                <h1>Achnatherum wallowaense</h1>
<p>Achnatherum wallowaense, commonly known as the Walloway needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that helps it blend into its natural environment.</p>
<p>Achnatherum wallowaense plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum wallowaense has narrow, linear leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a grass-like manner along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and often exhibits a slightly rough texture with a pale green to brownish color. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences composed of small, spikelet-like units, usually greenish or brownish in color, and they bloom in the late spring to early summer, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a small, dry, two-lobed achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor itself and spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum wallowaense is primarily native to the Pacific Northwest region of North America, specifically in the states of Oregon and Washington.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe, grasslands, and rocky slopes. This plant is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of the region, often growing in well-drained soils. It is particularly associated with the Walla Walla Valley area, where it thrives in the unique environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum wallowaense was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, open fields, and gravelly soils. This plant has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. It thrives in full sun and is often associated with dry, sandy environments.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation in certain ecosystems.</p>
