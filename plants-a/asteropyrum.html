                    <h1>Asteropyrum</h1>
<p>Asteropyrum, commonly known as the star moss, is a type of liverwort that belongs to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and small, scale-like leaves arranged in a star-like pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Asteropyrum is non-vascular, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>Its simple structure and ability to thrive in humid conditions make it an important component of certain ecosystems.</p>
