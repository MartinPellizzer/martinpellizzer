<p>Aegilops triuncialis f. nigroferruginea, commonly known as the black and rust-seeded wild oat, is a diploid grass species characterized by its distinctive dark-colored seeds.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are typically dark brown to black in color. It is closely related to other wild oat species and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Its genetic makeup has made it a subject of study in plant breeding and evolutionary botany.</p>
