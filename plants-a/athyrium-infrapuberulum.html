                    <h1>Athyrium infrapuberulum</h1>
<p>Athyrium infrapuberulum, commonly known as the velvet shield fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnate fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are covered in a dense, velvety layer of fine hairs, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant is often found in temperate regions of Asia and North America.</p>
