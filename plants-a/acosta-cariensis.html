                <h1>Acosta cariensis</h1>
<p>Acosta cariensis, commonly known as the Brazilian nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow flowers that bloom at night. Its leaves are broad and oval-shaped, and it produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided by livestock and wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta cariensis has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a slightly rough texture and a reddish-brown bark that peels off in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta cariensis is primarily native to the humid lowland regions of northern South America, particularly in parts of Colombia, Venezuela, and the Guianas.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical rainforests where there is high humidity and abundant rainfall throughout the year. This plant is commonly found in the understory of these dense forests, often growing along riverbanks and in shaded areas. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches that provide the right combination of light, moisture, and soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Acosta cariensis is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta cariensis was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in humid, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high rainfall and warm temperatures, such as parts of South America and the Caribbean. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. Its introduction has been primarily through horticultural trade and intentional planting by gardeners and landscapers.</p>
<p>However, it has also become naturalized in some regions, raising concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
