                <h1>Acilepis lanata</h1>
<p>Acilepis lanata, commonly known as the woolly acilepis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its unique texture and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis lanata has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a woolly, pubescent surface and a gray-green color; they are alternate in arrangement and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is light brown in color and exhibits an erect growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensively branched, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis lanata is primarily native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the dry deciduous forests and spiny forests of the eastern part of the island. The plant thrives in regions with low rainfall and high temperatures. It is commonly found at elevations ranging from 50 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis lanata was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as gardening and horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and areas with moderate to high moisture levels. The plant has adapted well to various climates, making it a potential invasive species in some regions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds contribute to its successful establishment.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems requires further study and monitoring.</p>
