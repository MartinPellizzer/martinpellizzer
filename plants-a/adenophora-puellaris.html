                <h1>Adenophora puellaris</h1>
<p>Adenophora puellaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adenophora puellaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora puellaris has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a climbing growth pattern that often involves twining around supports. Its flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in umbels, with white to pale blue petals and a yellow center, blooming in summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and establish in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora puellaris is primarily native to the mountainous regions of China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Tibet.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations, typically between 2,500 and 4,500 meters above sea level. This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in areas with well-drained soils. It is an important part of the local flora and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora puellaris was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils in temperate climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is known for its showy blue to purple flowers. It has become naturalized in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native plant species in certain ecosystems.</p>
