                    <h1>Avena flexuosa var. umbrosa</h1>
<p>Avena flexuosa var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shaded oatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features slender, arching stems that often form dense mats, with narrow, grass-like leaves that have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its ecological role is significant in maintaining the biodiversity of shaded, mesic ecosystems.</p>
