<p>Acaena pinnatifida var. aculeata, commonly known as the hooked acaena, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its dense, spiny growth and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of hard, berry-like fruits. Its prickly structure helps in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals.</p>
<p>This species is often found in coastal and forested areas, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity.</p>
