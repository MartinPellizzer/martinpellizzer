                    <h1>Anosporum pectinatum</h1>
<p>Anosporum pectinatum, commonly known as the clustered liverwort, is a small, perennial moss-like plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a complex thallus structure with distinct leaf-like structures called phyllidia, which are arranged in a rosette pattern. Anosporum pectinatum reproduces through spores, which are produced in specialized structures called sporocarps.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes and its role in soil stabilization.</p>
