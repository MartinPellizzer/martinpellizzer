                <h1>Adenospermum tuberculatum</h1>
<p>Adenospermum tuberculatum, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, containing cardiac glycosides.</p>
<p>Adenospermum tuberculatum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenospermum tuberculatum has leaves that are simple, alternate, and ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, cylindrical, and has a rough, fissured bark that is grayish-brown in color, growing either upright or sprawling depending on the environment. Its flowers are showy, tubular, and usually yellow or orange, with a five-lobed corolla, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by birds, especially sunbirds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenospermum tuberculatum is primarily native to Central and South America, including countries such as Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded areas within forests or along stream banks. This plant thrives in humid climates and is typically associated with lowland and montane habitats. Its distribution includes parts of the Caribbean as well as regions of southern North America.</p>
<p>Adenospermum tuberculatum is well adapted to the warm, humid environments of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenospermum tuberculatum was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Texas and Florida, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers.</p>
<p>It has since spread into other regions, including parts of California and Arizona, often escaping cultivation and establishing itself in natural habitats. This plant is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils contribute to its spread.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its population and prevent further expansion.</p>
