                    <h1>Androsace dissecta</h1>
<p>Androsace dissecta, commonly known as the dissected rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, rosette-like leaves that are finely dissected, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine habitats.</p>
