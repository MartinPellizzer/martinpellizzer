                    <h1>Arenaria arundana</h1>
<p>Arenaria arundana, commonly known as the sand sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in rocky or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Arenaria arundana is adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas.</p>
