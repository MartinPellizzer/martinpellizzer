<p>Atriplex herzogii, commonly known as the Herzog's saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically in the spring. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it a valuable species for stabilizing soils in saline areas.</p>
<p>Atriplex herzogii plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and preventing desertification.</p>
