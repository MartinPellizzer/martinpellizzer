<p>Abrophyllum ornans var. microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited ornate abrophyllum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are borne on slender stalks. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more numerous fruits compared to other varieties of Abrophyllum.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
