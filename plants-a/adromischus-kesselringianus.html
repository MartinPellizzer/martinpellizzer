<p>Adromischus kesselringianus, commonly known as the "Coral Cactus," is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, rounded leaves that are typically red or pink in color, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adromischus kesselringianus has fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a waxy surface that ranges in color from bluish-green to purple.</p>
<p>The stem is short and often hidden beneath the leaves, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains compact and shrub-like in growth. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, smooth seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Its root system is shallow and succulent, adapted to store water in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adromischus kesselringianus is primarily native to South Africa, specifically the eastern regions of the country.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal areas of the Eastern Cape Province. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing in limestone formations. It is adapted to a Mediterranean climate with wet winters and dry summers.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes rocky outcrops and sandy soils in the coastal regions of South Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adromischus kesselringianus was mainly introduced to the United States and parts of Europe as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, rosette-forming leaves and ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant because of its low maintenance requirements and aesthetic appeal. The plant is particularly popular among succulent enthusiasts for its unique appearance and ease of care.
