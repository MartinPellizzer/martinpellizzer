                        <h1>Abronia covillei</h1>
<p>Abronia covillei, commonly known as the Coville's bluemont, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, tubular blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is typically found in limestone-rich habitats and is pollinated by various insects, including bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia covillei is primarily native to the southwestern United States, specifically Arizona and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in desert scrub and rocky habitats within these regions. This plant thrives in arid environments with well-drained soils. It is often associated with limestone formations and can be found in areas with sparse vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia covillei was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky habitats and sandy soils within desert environments. This plant is often associated with limestone and granite outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native region.</p>
