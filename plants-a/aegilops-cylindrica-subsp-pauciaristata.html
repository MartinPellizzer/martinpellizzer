<p>Aegilops cylindrica subsp.</p>
<p>pauciaristata, commonly known as the slender wild rye, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as steppes and grasslands. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and is known for its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for improving wheat varieties through genetic crosses.</p>
