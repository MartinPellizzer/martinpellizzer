<p>Asplenium setulosum, commonly known as the hairy spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Asplenium setulosum is relatively easy to care for and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its compact size and ornamental appearance.</p>
