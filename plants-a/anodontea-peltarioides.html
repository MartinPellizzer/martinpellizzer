<p>Anodontea peltarioides, commonly known as the peltate liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Peltate.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern and the presence of peltate thallus, which is a flat, leaf-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>Anodontea peltarioides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms.</p>
