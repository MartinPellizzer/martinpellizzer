                <h1>Adelmeria undulata</h1>
<p>Adelmeria undulata, commonly known as the woolly curlcup, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cactaceae family, characterized by its succulent stems and modified leaves. The plant features showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Adelmeria undulata is typically found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelmeria undulata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub with a dense, upright habit. Its flowers are showy, with five petals that are pink to red in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of branches, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a red, fleshy capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by birds and through the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelmeria undulata is primarily native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of this archipelago. This plant typically grows in coastal areas and rocky habitats. It is part of the Ericaceae family and is known for its distinctive undulating leaves.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific islands within the Philippines.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelmeria undulata was mainly introduced to areas with mild, coastal climates, particularly in the western United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. The plant is known for its attractive, wavy-leaf structure and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. Due to its hardy nature, it has been introduced to several regions beyond its native range.</p>
<p>However, its spread is often limited by environmental conditions and competition with native species.</p>
