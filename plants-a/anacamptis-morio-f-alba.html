                    <h1>Anacamptis morio f. alba</h1>
<p>Anacamptis morio f. alba, commonly known as the white marsh orchid, is a rare and striking variant of the common marsh orchid.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale white to almost translucent flowers, which contrast sharply with its greenish-yellow sepals and petals. This orchid typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, calcareous soils. The plant produces a single spike of 10â€“20 flowers, each with a distinctive spurred lip.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a protected species in several European countries.</p>
