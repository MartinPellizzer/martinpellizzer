                <h1>Adiantum hippocrepis</h1>
<p>Adiantum hippocrepis, commonly known as the rock fern or shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky, moist environments, such as stream banks and shaded forest floors. Its rhizomes are short and often form dense mats, which help anchor it to its substrate.</p>
<p>Adiantum hippocrepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum hippocrepis has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically bright green, with a slender, upright arrangement along the stem. The stem is slender and often hairy, with a light green to brownish bark that remains smooth as the plant grows. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, winged capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous, helping to anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum hippocrepis is primarily native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of northern Africa, including Morocco and Algeria. This fern thrives in rocky, coastal areas and limestone soils. It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic areas due to its particular environmental requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum hippocrepis was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a fern species that was brought there intentionally for ornamental purposes. The plant has since become established in various habitats across the country. It is often found in damp, shaded areas such as forest floors and rock crevices.</p>
<p>Despite its introduction, it is not considered a major invasive species in New Zealand.</p>
