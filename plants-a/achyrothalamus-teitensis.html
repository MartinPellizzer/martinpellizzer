                <h1>Achyrothalamus teitensis</h1>
<p>Achyrothalamus teitensis, commonly known as the Teitan mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red or pink. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it thrives in humid, tropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrothalamus teitensis has simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops fissures with age. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers with five petals, usually white or pale green, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and aiding in stabilization.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrothalamus teitensis is primarily native to the island of Saint Lucia in the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is found in the humid, tropical rainforest ecosystems of the island. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist understory conditions. It is commonly associated with limestone soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrothalamus teitensis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in the tropical regions of Hawaii and other archipelagos.</p>
<p>It was brought there likely as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. The distribution of this species has expanded beyond its original range due to human activity and environmental conditions that support its growth. It is now found in various locations across the Pacific, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Americas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
