                    <h1>Aconitum atees</h1>
<p>Aconitum atees, commonly known as the Tibetan aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy flowers that typically range from blue to violet in color. The plant produces follicles containing toxic alkaloids, making it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its potent toxins, it is handled with caution and is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
