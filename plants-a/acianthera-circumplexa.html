                <h1>Acianthera circumplexa</h1>
<p>Acianthera circumplexa, commonly known as the clustered orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has a sympodial growth pattern, with multiple stems arising from a central rhizome. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a circular pattern around the stem.</p>
<p>Acianthera circumplexa is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera circumplexa has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, and are medium-sized, ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a dark green color and a slightly waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching towards the top. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera circumplexa is primarily native to Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico Central, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Southeast, Mexico Southwest, and Nicaragua.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of Central America. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant is well-adapted to the diverse microclimates within these regions.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its preference for warm, moist habitats with rich soil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera circumplexa was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscape gardening.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides, abandoned fields, and urban environments. This plant has adapted well to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an aggressive colonizer in non-native regions.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native plant species.</p>
