<p>Acianthera circumplexa, commonly known as the clustered orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with white to pale yellow petals and a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts for its unique floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera circumplexa has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, slightly hairy texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemose inflorescences, featuring white to pale pink petals and yellowish-green sepals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera circumplexa is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed in the Atlantic Forest and adjacent areas, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. This plant prefers lowland to montane forests, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Acianthera circumplexa is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acianthera circumplexa is a captivating orchid known for its vibrant, fragrant flowers and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed germination or by dividing the rhizomes, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant thrives in a cool, humid environment with a distinct growth cycle that includes a rest period during winter and active growth in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil, moderate watering, and careful attention to avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot. Fertilization with a balanced orchid mix during the growing season and regular pruning of dead or damaged foliage promote healthy growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or mealybugs.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving plants like ferns or mosses can enhance its aesthetic appeal and create a thriving micro-ecosystem.</p>
