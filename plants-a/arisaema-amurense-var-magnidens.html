<p>Arisaema amurense var. magnidens, commonly known as the large-flowered arisaema, is a herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, spadix surrounded by a broad, leaf-like spathe that can be green or reddish in color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form colonies.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife.</p>
