<p>Aphananthemum salicifolium, commonly known as the willow-leaved aphananthemum, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, willow-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to arid conditions and thrives in full sun with well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Aphananthemum salicifolium is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
