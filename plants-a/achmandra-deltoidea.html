                <h1>Achmandra deltoidea</h1>
<p>Achmandra deltoidea, commonly known as the delta leaf achmandra, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deltoid-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland conservation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achmandra deltoidea has broad, deltoid-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a rough, reddish-brown bark, and grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achmandra deltoidea is primarily native to southern Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as Veracruz, Oaxaca, and Chiapas in Mexico. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded areas within forests. It is also present in countries like Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes lowland forests and areas with high humidity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achmandra deltoidea was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It was originally native to South America, specifically Brazil. The plant was introduced as an ornamental species due to its attractive, deltoid-shaped leaves. It has since become naturalized in certain wetland and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited compared to other invasive species in the region.</p>
