<p>Aegiphila elongata, commonly known as the longleaf aegiphila, is a species of flowering plant native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the branches.</p>
<p>Aegiphila elongata is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to grow in sandy or limestone soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila elongata has elongated, narrow leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white in color, with tubular structures that bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by insects.
