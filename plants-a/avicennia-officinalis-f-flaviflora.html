                    <h1>Avicennia officinalis f. flaviflora</h1>
<p>Avicennia officinalis f. flaviflora, commonly known as the yellow-flowered mangrove, is a variant of the mangrove species native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as tidal mudflats and estuaries. The plant exhibits pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces small, woody fruits that disperse via water.</p>
<p>This plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
