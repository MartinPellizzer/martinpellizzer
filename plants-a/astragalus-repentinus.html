                    <h1>Astragalus repentinus</h1>
<p>Astragalus repentinus, commonly known as the sudden astragalus, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Astragalus repentinus is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
