                <h1>Acleisanthes undulata</h1>
<p>Acleisanthes undulata, commonly known as the wavy-flowered acleisanthes, is a species of flowering plant in the family Nyctaginaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, wavy-edged flowers that range in color from white to pink. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Acleisanthes undulata is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes undulata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly woody, and has a smooth, light green to brownish bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are tubular, with five lobes, and are typically pale yellow to orange in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elongated seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes undulata is primarily native to Mexico Northeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the northeastern regions of Mexico, particularly in the states of Nuevo Le√≥n and Tamaulipas. This plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. It is adapted to the warm and dry climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>The species is part of the Acanthaceae family and is known for its distinctive undulating leaves.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes undulata was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, railroads, and agricultural fields. The plant thrives in dry, open habitats with well-drained soils. It has become a weed in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities in these areas.</p>
