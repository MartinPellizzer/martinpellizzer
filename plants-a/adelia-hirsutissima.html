                <h1>Adelia hirsutissima</h1>
<p>Adelia hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy adelia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Adelia hirsutissima is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia hirsutissima has hairy, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in fine hairs, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia hirsutissima is primarily native to South Africa, specifically the Eastern Cape province.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky outcrops and along the coast in areas with a Mediterranean climate. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with coastal dunes and sandy soils. It is a hardy species that can tolerate periods of drought.</p>
<p>Adelia hirsutissima is an important component of the fynbos vegetation type in this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia hirsutissima was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction. Due to its adaptability, it has become invasive in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
