                <h1>Acidanthera nelloi</h1>
<p>Acidanthera nelloi, commonly known as the Nelloi orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny environments and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive spurred lip that aids in pollination.</p>
<p>Acidanthera nelloi is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidanthera nelloi has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, with a smooth texture and a light greenish-brown color, growing upright and branching sparingly. The flowers are small, tubular, and violet in color, blooming during the spring season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in the soil, facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidanthera nelloi is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, specifically Namibia and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the Atlantic coastline. This species thrives in areas with moderate to high rainfall and is often associated with dune and coastal grassland habitats. It is known for its striking pink to purple flowers that bloom during the cooler months.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized plant within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidanthera nelloi was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread across various regions of the country. This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. It is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
