                    <h1>Amygdalus humilis</h1>
<p>Amygdalus humilis, commonly known as the wild almond or dwarf almond, is a small, shrub-like plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, hard nuts that are encased in a thick, woody shell. It is often found in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>While not as economically important as its domesticated counterpart, the common almond, Amygdalus humilis plays a role in local ecosystems and has some historical uses in traditional medicine.</p>
