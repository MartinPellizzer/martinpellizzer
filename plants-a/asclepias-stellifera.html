                    <h1>Asclepias stellifera</h1>
<p>Asclepias stellifera, commonly known as the starry milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap, which is typical of the milkweed genus, and its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Asclepias stellifera plays a vital role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to arid environments makes it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
