                    <h1>Asplenium × nigrofriesiorum</h1>
<p>Asplenium × nigrofriesiorum, commonly known as the black-veined maidenhair fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between *Asplenium bulbiferum* and *Asplenium trichomanes*.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with prominent, contrasting black veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This fern is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
