                    <h1>Arthrophytum subulifolium</h1>
<p>Arthrophytum subulifolium, commonly known as the desert stonecress, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh desert environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and resilience make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
