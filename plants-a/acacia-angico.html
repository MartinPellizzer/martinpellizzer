                        <h1>Acacia angico</h1>
<p>Acacia angico, commonly known as angico, is a deciduous tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, flat, bipinnate leaves. The tree produces yellowish to golden-green flowers that are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Its bark is thick and fissured, often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Acacia angico is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia angico is primarily native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is found in the states of Pará, Maranhão, Piauí, Ceará, Pernambuco, and Bahia. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often in dry to semi-deciduous forests. It is also present in parts of northern Argentina and northern Paraguay.</p>
<p>Acacia angico is commonly found in savannas and along riverbanks in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia angico was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, for its timber and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It has been widely planted in regions with tropical and subtropical climates due to its fast growth and adaptability. However, its introduction has led to ecological concerns as it can become invasive in certain environments. The plant is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised questions about its impact on native flora and biodiversity.</p>
