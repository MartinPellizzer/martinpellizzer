                    <h1>Agrostis limonias</h1>
<p>Agrostis limonias, commonly known as lemongrass agrostis, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight bluish-green hue, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness.</p>
<p>Agrostis limonias is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity in grassland ecosystems.</p>
