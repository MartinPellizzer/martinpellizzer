                <h1>Acranthera ceylanica</h1>
<p>Acranthera ceylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon starflower, is a flowering plant native to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant is herbaceous, with slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Acranthera ceylanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera ceylanica has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and covered with a smooth, grayish bark, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera ceylanica is primarily native to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the island's wet zone and intermediate elevation regions. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. It is known for its fragrant, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and threatened species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera ceylanica was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive white flowers.</p>
<p>It was first brought to these regions in the late 19th century by botanists and horticulturists interested in exotic flora. Despite its aesthetic appeal, the plant has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in forests and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect native biodiversity.</p>
