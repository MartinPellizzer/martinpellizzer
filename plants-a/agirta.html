                    <h1>Agirta</h1>
<p>Agirta, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, erect stalks emerging from water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. Agirta is known for its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance is further enhanced by its cultural and religious importance in many Asian traditions.</p>
