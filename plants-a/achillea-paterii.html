                <h1>Achillea paterii</h1>
<p>Achillea paterii, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its foliage consists of finely divided, gray-green leaves that are aromatic when crushed.</p>
<p>Achillea paterii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea paterii has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a grayish-green color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation and typically measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a light green color, growing from the base of the plant and branching sparingly. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a achene, with a pappus that aids in wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in suitable habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea paterii is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California.</p>
<p>It is found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. This plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and coastal areas. It is commonly found in areas like the Channel Islands and the central coast of California.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea paterii was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides in regions with temperate climates. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has the potential to become invasive in certain areas if not managed properly. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and rhizomes make it a concern for native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts often focus on controlling its spread to protect local biodiversity.</p>
