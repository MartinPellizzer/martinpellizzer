<p>Acacia assimilis subsp.</p>
<p>assimilis, commonly known as the silver acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and phyllodes that are narrow, linear, and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow globular flowerheads that appear in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, which are flattened, leaf-like structures that reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in savannas and rocky areas.</p>
