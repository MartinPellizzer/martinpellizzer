<p>Aster arenarius f. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered sand aster, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. Its white flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, adding a striking visual contrast to the surrounding landscape.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its pale, almost white petals, which set it apart from the typical blue or purple flowers of the species.</p>
