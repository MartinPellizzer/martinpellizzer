                            <h1>Agoseris Glauca Var. Pumila</h1>
<p>Agoseris glauca var. pumila is a lesser-known member of the Asteraceae family, often mistaken for a common weed due to its simple appearance. Found primarily in the western United States, this plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its small, blue to purple flowers bloom in early spring, adding subtle beauty to the landscape. Despite its modest size, it plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. This variety is also valued for its ornamental potential and ecological significance.</p>
