                <h1>Achillea nobilis subsp. neilreichii</h1>
<p>Achillea nobilis subsp.</p>
<p>neilreichii, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features wiry, upright stems and basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape.</p>
<p>The plant produces dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Its aromatic foliage and showy flowers make it a valuable addition to rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea nobilis subsp.</p>
<p>neilreichii has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are basal and arranged in a rosette, with a gray-green color and a slightly fuzzy texture. The stem is upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark, and grows in a compact, bushy pattern.</p>
<p>Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) that is dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea nobilis subsp.</p>
<p>neilreichii is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in parts of Italy and Austria. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Alps and the Dolomites.</p>
<p>This species thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in open meadows and alpine grasslands. It grows at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss and climate change, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea nobilis subsp.</p>
<p>neilreichii is a hardy perennial known for its vibrant yellow flowers and drought-resistant nature. It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in early spring and blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea nobilis subsp.</p>
<p>neilreichii is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both floral resources and habitat structure.</p>
<p>This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through shared nutrients and pest deterrence. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health through organic matter accumulation.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea nobilis subsp.</p>
<p>neilreichii is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, known for its aromatic foliage and yellow flowers. It has limited culinary use, primarily as a flavoring agent in some traditional recipes.</p>
<p>Medicinally, it has been used historically for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties, though scientific validation is limited. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic value in some regions, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea nobilis subsp.</p>
<p>neilreichii has several popular cultivars, including 'Moonbeam' and 'Snowflake', which are prized for their soft, fluffy white flowers and compact growth habit. These cultivars are often used in rock gardens and border landscapes due to their drought tolerance and attractive appearance.</p>
<p>Hybrids involving this subspecies have been developed to enhance traits such as flower color, disease resistance, and blooming period, expanding its horticultural versatility. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions and its contribution to garden aesthetics with its delicate, lace-like foliage. Overall, Achillea nobilis subsp.</p>
<p>neilreichii remains a valuable plant in both traditional and modern garden settings.</p>
