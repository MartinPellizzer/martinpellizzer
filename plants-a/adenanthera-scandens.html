                    <h1>Adenanthera scandens</h1>
<p>Adenanthera scandens, commonly known as the climbing pea or velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its twining stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a soft, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow,蝶形花 (butterfly-shaped) flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of protein-rich seeds.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and agroforestry systems.</p>
