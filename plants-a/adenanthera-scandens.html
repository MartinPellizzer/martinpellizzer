                <h1>Adenanthera scandens</h1>
<p>Adenanthera scandens, commonly known as the climbing pea or velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its twining stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a soft, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow,蝶形花 (butterfly-shaped) flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of protein-rich seeds.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and agroforestry systems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthera scandens has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and twining, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in panicles, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their small, winged structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera scandens is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Sudan.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of southern Asia, including India and Sri Lanka. This plant thrives in open woodlands, savannas, and along riverbanks where it can climb or trail along the ground. Its distribution extends into some areas of the Middle East and northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly known as the "sensitive plant" due to its ability to close its leaves in response to touch.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera scandens was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in reforestation and land restoration projects due to its rapid growth and deep root system. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it suitable for regions with high rainfall. It is often found in disturbed soils and can tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential requires careful management to prevent ecological imbalances.</p>
