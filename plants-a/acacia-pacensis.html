                        <h1>Acacia pacensis</h1>
<p>Acacia pacensis, commonly known as the Pacific acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and phyllodes that are narrow and linear, often with a slight curvature. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are typically visited by native bees and other pollinators. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a common adaptation in acacia species to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia pacensis is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia pacensis is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Northern Territory, Queensland, and New South Wales. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in coastal and inland areas. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Acacia pacensis is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native environment.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia pacensis was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and for its potential use in land rehabilitation projects.</p>
<p>It is commonly planted in degraded lands to stabilize soil and prevent further degradation. The plant is also valued for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its introduction has been particularly notable in regions with poor soil quality and limited vegetation cover.</p>
<p>However, there are concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
