                        <h1>Acacia pacensis</h1>
<p>Acacia pacensis, commonly known as the Pacific acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and phyllodes that are narrow and linear, often with a slight curvature. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are typically visited by native bees and other pollinators. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a common adaptation in acacia species to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia pacensis is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
