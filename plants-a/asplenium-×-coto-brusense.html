                    <h1>Asplenium × coto-brusense</h1>
<p>Asplenium × coto-brusense, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between *Asplenium cotoense* and *Asplenium brusonii*.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green, strap-like fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive system involves the production of spores, typical of ferns, and it exhibits a complex morphology typical of the Asplenium genus.</p>
<p>The hybrid is of interest to botanists due to its genetic diversity and potential ecological adaptations.</p>
