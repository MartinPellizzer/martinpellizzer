                    <h1>Astragalus pachyrrhizus</h1>
<p>Astragalus pachyrrhizus, commonly known as the thick-root milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, thickened roots that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with compound leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
