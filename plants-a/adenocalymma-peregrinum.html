                <h1>Adenocalymma peregrinum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma peregrinum, commonly known as the wandering bladder, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique bladder-like structures on its stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are ovate and slightly hairy, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma peregrinum is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma peregrinum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging in size from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that exhibits a slightly fibrous texture. Its flowers are small, white to pale pink, and clustered in racemose inflorescences, blooming during the cooler months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release smooth, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma peregrinum is primarily native to Bolivia, Brazil North, Brazil Northeast, Brazil South, Brazil Southeast, Brazil West-Central, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the diverse ecosystems of these regions, including grasslands and savannas. It is commonly associated with areas that have seasonal rainfall patterns. Its distribution spans across several South American countries, reflecting its adaptability to different environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The species is well-suited to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma peregrinum was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with warm, temperate climates where it thrives in well-drained soils. This plant is often used for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it can become invasive in some areas if not properly managed.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
