                <h1>Acicarphaea artemisiifolia</h1>
<p>Acicarphaea artemisiifolia, commonly known as common wormwood, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and has been introduced to other regions. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in waste areas.</p>
<p>The plant contains volatile oils and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acicarphaea artemisiifolia has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a light green to brownish bark that becomes more woody with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acicarphaea artemisiifolia is primarily native to temperate regions of Eurasia and North America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. The plant thrives in a variety of habitats including meadows, woodlands, and agricultural lands. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a widespread weed in many parts of the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acicarphaea artemisiifolia was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as landscaping and agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides, fields, and vacant lots. This plant has a strong competitive advantage due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to invade native ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains relatively localized compared to other invasive species.</p>
