<p>Acer palmatum var. linearilobum, commonly known as the Japanese maple with linear lobes, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely dissected, linearly lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 3â€“6 meters and has a compact, upright growth habit. It prefers partial shade and well-drained, acidic soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies primarily in its striking foliage rather than its flowers or fruits.</p>
