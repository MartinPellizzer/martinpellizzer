<p>Achillea setacea f. ramosa, commonly known as the branched yarrow, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is native to regions of southern Europe and is often found in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky soils. It produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread.</p>
<p>The cultivar 'ramosa' is distinguished by its more branched growth habit compared to the typical form of Achillea setacea.</p>
