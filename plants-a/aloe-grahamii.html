                    <h1>Aloe grahamii</h1>
<p>Aloe grahamii, commonly known as Graham's aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. The leaves are typically pale green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, adding ornamental value to the plant.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
