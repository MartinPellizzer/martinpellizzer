<p>Asplenium filiforme, commonly known as the slender spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sorangia, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium filiforme is an important indicator species for certain microhabitats due to its specific ecological requirements.</p>
