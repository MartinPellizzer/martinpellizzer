<p>This variant of Abelia macrotera is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often associated with coastal and riverine habitats. The plant is well adapted to the humid climate and frequent rainfall of its native range.</p>
<p>It is an important species in the ecological makeup of these wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelia macrotera var. parvifolia was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers.</p>
