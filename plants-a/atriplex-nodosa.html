                    <h1>Atriplex nodosa</h1>
<p>Atriplex nodosa, commonly known as the nodding saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to harsh, saline environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, nodding inflorescences, which give it its common name. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity.</p>
<p>Atriplex nodosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
