                    <h1>Antennaria subcanescens</h1>
<p>Antennaria subcanescens, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are linear, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Antennaria subcanescens is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
