                    <h1>Acrotrema uniflorum var. dentatum</h1>
<p>Acrotrema uniflorum var. dentatum, commonly known as the toothed acrotrema, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, finely toothed leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or rocky crevices. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its specific ecological niche, with features that aid in water retention and light capture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant species for ecological studies.</p>
