                <h1>Acranthera simalurensis</h1>
<p>Acranthera simalurensis, commonly known as the Simalurensis starflower, is a flowering plant native to the humid forests of western Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant is herbaceous, with slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing along forest floors or in understory habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera simalurensis has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, slightly woody texture and a pale green to brownish color. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soils it inhabits.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera simalurensis is primarily native to Sumatera.</p>
<p>This rare orchid species is found in the tropical rainforests of the Indonesian island of Sumatera. It typically grows in humid, shaded understory environments within lowland and montane forests. The plant is known for its delicate flowers and is often associated with specific microhabitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera simalurensis was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive floral display.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and cultivated landscapes across southern Europe, particularly in countries like Spain and Italy. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for Mediterranean climates. Its introduction has led to its occasional presence in natural habitats, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is not widely naturalized in the wild and remains primarily a cultivated species.</p>
