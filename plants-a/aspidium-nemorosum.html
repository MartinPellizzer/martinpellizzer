<p>Aspidium nemorosum, commonly known as the wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Its rhizomes are fibrous and form dense colonies, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Aspidium nemorosum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
