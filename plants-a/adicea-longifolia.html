                <h1>Adicea longifolia</h1>
<p>Adicea longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf adicea, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically arranged in spikes, often displaying vibrant colors such as red or purple. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercialized.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea longifolia has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plant's growth. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea longifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This species thrives in coastal and mangrove environments, often growing in sandy or muddy soils near the shoreline. It is also present in parts of the Indian subcontinent, including India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Adicea longifolia is an important plant in local ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea longifolia was mainly introduced to new habitats in the Pacific Islands through human activities such as horticulture and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed soils, where it thrives in moist, tropical conditions. The plant has been reported in several islands, including Hawaii, Guam, and parts of Micronesia. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>However, it is not currently classified as an invasive species in most of these regions.</p>
