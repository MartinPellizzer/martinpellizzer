                <h1>Acosta rouyi</h1>
<p>Acosta rouyi, commonly known as the Yunnan rhododendron, is a species of evergreen shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions with acidic soils, thriving in cool, humid climates. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Acosta rouyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta rouyi has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta rouyi is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>It is found in areas with high humidity and cool temperatures, typically at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. This plant thrives in dense forests and is often associated with shaded environments. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is known for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Acosta rouyi is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta rouyi was mainly introduced to the Southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often associated with disturbed or open habitats. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>It is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
