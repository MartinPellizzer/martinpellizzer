                    <h1>Asplenium dimorphum</h1>
<p>Asplenium dimorphum, commonly known as the two-form spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive fronds that are typically divided into two different forms: the fertile and sterile leaves. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the late spring and early summer. Asplenium dimorphum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
