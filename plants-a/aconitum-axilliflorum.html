                <h1>Aconitum axilliflorum</h1>
<p>Aconitum axilliflorum, commonly known as the axillary-flowered monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple spurred flowers. The plant has palmately compound leaves with lobes that are usually hairy and serrated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas.</p>
<p>Aconitum axilliflorum contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum axilliflorum has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter beneath, with a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat woody at the base, and covered with a smooth, dark brown bark. Its flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in racemes, blooming in late summer; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, helping the plant to store nutrients and survive in its alpine or woodland habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum axilliflorum is primarily native to Primorye.</p>
<p>It is found in the southeastern part of Russia, specifically in the Primorsky Krai region. This plant thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of the Primorye region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum axilliflorum was mainly introduced to regions with moist, temperate climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks, preferring partial to full shade. This plant has been introduced to several parts of Europe and North America as an ornamental due to its attractive blue-violet flowers. However, it can become invasive in certain areas if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities in non-native habitats.</p>
