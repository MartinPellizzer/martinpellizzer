                <h1>Achillea tenorei</h1>
<p>Achillea tenorei, commonly known as the Tuscan yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads that range from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm, featuring slender, aromatic leaves with a fern-like appearance. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early autumn, and it thrives in well-drained, sunny soils.</p>
<p>Achillea tenorei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea tenorei has basal, gray-green leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a rosette, and measure approximately 5–10 cm in length, with a silvery-white underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-brown color, growing in a compact, bushy pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-white composite heads with ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the rocky and arid environments where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea tenorei is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, specifically found in parts of southern Italy, including Sicily and Sardinia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely restricted to its native habitat due to its specific environmental requirements. It thrives in dry, rocky, and sunny environments, often growing on limestone soils. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea tenorei is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea tenorei is a low-maintenance perennial known for its bright yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the roots in early spring. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, avoiding overwatering to prevent root rot. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme enhances its growth and deters pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea tenorei is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including insects and birds, which rely on its blooms for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. Additionally, its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Achillea tenorei also contributes to biodiversity by supporting a diverse ecosystem in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea tenorei is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it can be used in gardens to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. In traditional medicine, it has been used for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties, though scientific validation is limited. It plays a role in supporting local biodiversity and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is valued for its beauty and has been featured in botanical art and horticultural practices.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
