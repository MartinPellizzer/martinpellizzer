                    <h1>Arachis rasteiro</h1>
<p>Arachis rasteiro, commonly known as the creeping peanut, is a species of legume native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with sprawling stems that hug the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pods containing edible seeds, similar to other peanut species. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in grassy areas or disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing nature, it is sometimes used as a cover crop or for erosion control.</p>
