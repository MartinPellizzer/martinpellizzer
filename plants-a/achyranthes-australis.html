                <h1>Achyranthes australis</h1>
<p>Achyranthes australis, commonly known as the Indian knotgrass, is a perennial herb native to the warmer regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes australis has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 5-10 cm long, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes during the summer months, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release three seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes australis is primarily native to southern and eastern Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Japan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with temperate to subtropical climates. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in wetlands, riverbanks, and marshy areas. It is also present in parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its native distribution includes a variety of habitats ranging from coastal areas to inland wetlands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes australis was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, riverbanks, and urban environments. The plant is considered a weed in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution is largely limited to the northern and central parts of New Zealand, where the climate is more temperate.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive potential, it is still used in landscaping and erosion control in certain areas.</p>
