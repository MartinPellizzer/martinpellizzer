<p>Allocarya greenei var. hystricula, commonly known as the spiny lichen.</p>
<p>It is a fruticose lichen characterized by its dense, branched growth form and a distinctive yellowish to orange-red color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on tree trunks and branches in tropical and subtropical regions. Its thallus is composed of a complex intergrowth of fungal hyphae and algal cells, which contribute to its unique appearance and ecological role.</p>
<p>The spines on its surface are a key feature, providing structural support and aiding in water retention.</p>
