                <h1>Adina globiflora</h1>
<p>Adina globiflora, commonly known as the globeflower, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spherical inflorescence that resembles a globe, composed of numerous small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>Adina globiflora is valued not only for its ornamental appearance but also for its traditional medicinal uses in some cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina globiflora has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, light brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina globiflora is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils, often growing in shaded undergrowth. It is also present in parts of China and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Adina globiflora is often associated with secondary forests and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina globiflora was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and small white flowers.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the late 19th century and has since spread to other tropical regions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in some areas.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
