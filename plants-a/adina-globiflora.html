                <h1>Adina globiflora</h1>
<p>Adina globiflora, commonly known as the globeflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique spherical flower heads, which are composed of numerous small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of yellow and orange, are adapted for attracting pollinators like bees and birds.</p>
<p>Adina globiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina globiflora has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 3 to 8 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, woody, and slightly hairy, with a pale brown bark that peels in thin, flaky layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina globiflora is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of southern China and the Indian subcontinent, though it is less common outside its native range. It thrives in humid, lowland tropical forests and is often found near streams or in shaded understory areas. The species typically grows at altitudes between 200 and 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, Adina globiflora is considered a conservation concern and is listed as endangered in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
