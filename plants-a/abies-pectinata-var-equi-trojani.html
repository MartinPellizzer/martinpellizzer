                        <h1>Abies pectinata var. equi-trojani</h1>
<p>Abies pectinata var. equi-trojani, commonly known as the Trojan fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like foliage. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies pectinata var. equi-trojani is primarily native to the mountainous regions of the Carpathian Mountains in Central Europe.</p>
<p>This variant of the silver fir is found in the higher elevations of countries such as Romania, Slovakia, and Ukraine. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils, typically in forested areas. The plant is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine environments, where it forms part of the subalpine and montane forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies pectinata var. equi-trojani was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high elevation and moderate temperatures, making it suitable for alpine and subalpine habitats. This variety is often planted in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh weather conditions. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
