<p>Abies pectinata var. equi-trojani, commonly known as the Trojan fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like foliage. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
