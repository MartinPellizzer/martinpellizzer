<p>Anhalonium prismaticum, commonly known as the prism leaf cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>Anhalonium prismaticum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in low-water conditions.</p>
