                        <h1>Abutilon inclusum</h1>
<p>Abutilon inclusum, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants like hibiscus and cotton.</p>
<p>Abutilon inclusum is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and blooms.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Abutilon inclusum belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, which comprises flowering plants with a diverse range of morphological features and reproductive structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malvales, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species such as cotton and hibiscus. Its family is Malvaceae, commonly known as the mallow family, which includes plants with showy flowers and a variety of ecological and economic significance. Its genus is Abutilon, a group of flowering plants commonly known as the "velvetleaf" or "Chinese lantern" plants, characterized by their fuzzy leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Abutilon inclusum, a specific plant within the genus Abutilon, known for its distinctive appearance and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon inclusum is primarily native to Cuba and Haiti.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical regions of these Caribbean islands. It typically grows in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. The plant is known for its distinctive velvety leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific geographic locations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon inclusum was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas where it can spread rapidly. The plant is considered invasive in some parts of New Zealand, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and seed dispersal mechanisms contribute to its success in establishing itself in new habitats.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on native biodiversity.</p>
