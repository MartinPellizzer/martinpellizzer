                <h1>Acmadenia obtusata</h1>
<p>Acmadenia obtusata, commonly known as the broad-leafed acmadenia, is a small shrub native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its simple, often aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with dry summers. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are usually clustered in leaf axils, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated.</p>
<p>Acmadenia obtusata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes grown in gardens for its compact form and fragrant foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmadenia obtusata has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, fragrant flowers are yellowish-green with five petals, blooming in spring and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia obtusata is primarily native to eastern Australia, specifically found in the states of New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in woodland and rainforest habitats, often growing in areas with well-drained soils. This species is typically found in regions with a subtropical to temperate climate, including the coastal areas of the eastern seaboard. It prefers partial to full sunlight and is often associated with other native flora in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Acmadenia obtusata is a shrub that plays an important role in the local biodiversity and ecological balance of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia obtusata was mainly introduced to gardens and cultivated areas in Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria.</p>
<p>It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit. The plant prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade conditions. It is commonly used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in coastal regions.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is considered invasive in some areas where it can spread beyond cultivated sites.</p>
