                    <h1>Ammophila arenaria var. arundinacea</h1>
<p>Ammophila arenaria var. arundinacea, commonly known as the European beachgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fibrous rhizomes that help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important plant for dune formation. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in salty, well-drained environments and is often used in coastal restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate harsh conditions makes it a key species in preventing erosion along shorelines.</p>
