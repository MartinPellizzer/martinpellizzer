                <h1>Adinandra obtusissima</h1>
<p>Adinandra obtusissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved adinandra, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are small, round berries that turn red when mature, attracting various bird species.</p>
<p>Adinandra obtusissima is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra obtusissima has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra obtusissima is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest regions, often in humid and tropical climates. This species thrives in shaded environments under the canopy of mature forests. It is particularly common in Borneo and Sumatra, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its distribution has become fragmented in recent years.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra obtusissima was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing as an understory plant. This species is native to Southeast Asia but has been introduced to other parts of the world, including parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands. Its introduction is often associated with horticultural interests due to its attractive foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native environments.</p>
