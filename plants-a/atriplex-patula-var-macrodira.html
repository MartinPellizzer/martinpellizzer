                    <h1>Atriplex patula var. macrodira</h1>
<p>Atriplex patula var. macrodira, commonly known as the broadleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for reclaiming degraded lands.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important component of ecological restoration projects.</p>
