                <h1>Adicea ciliata</h1>
<p>Adicea ciliata, commonly known as the hairy adicea, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats.</p>
<p>Adicea ciliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea ciliata has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy underside; they are usually 2–5 cm long and 1–2 cm wide, and have a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and often branching, with a light green to pale yellow bark that is smooth and slightly hairy. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with five white or pale pink petals and yellow stamens; they bloom in spring and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea ciliata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest understories and along riverbanks. This species thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils. It is also present in parts of Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>Adicea ciliata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea ciliata was mainly introduced to new habitats in regions with disturbed soils and wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas where human activity has altered the natural landscape. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and can often be seen along waterways and in floodplains. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several non-native regions, including parts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
