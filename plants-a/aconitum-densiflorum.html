                <h1>Aconitum densiflorum</h1>
<p>Aconitum densiflorum, commonly known as the dense-flowered monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant features a thick, spindle-shaped root system and lanceolate, doubly serrated leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a dangerous plant to handle without proper protection.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum densiflorum has compound, deeply lobed leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and smooth, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age, and it grows in a straight, unbranched pattern. The flowers are clustered in dense, spikelike inflorescences, featuring blue to purple petals with a yellow center, and they bloom in late summer to early autumn, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, tuberous, and fibrous, helping the plant survive in cold, moist environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum densiflorum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, including parts of France, Italy, and the Balkans.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often found in rocky soils and open meadows at high elevations. This species is also present in some areas of the Iberian Peninsula and extends into the Carpathian Mountains. It is commonly associated with moist, well-drained soils and is often found in areas with cool, temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for specific ecological conditions, its distribution is relatively limited compared to other aconite species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum densiflorum was mainly introduced to North America through human activities, including horticultural trade and intentional cultivation.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shady environments such as woodland areas and along stream banks. The plant has spread beyond its original introduction sites due to its adaptability and reproductive capabilities. It is considered an invasive species in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to prevent its further spread and minimize ecological impact.</p>
