<p>Aechmea lutea, commonly known as the yellow bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically broad and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Aechmea lutea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant colors and unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea lutea has leaves that are broad, sword-shaped, and arranged in a rosette pattern, with a vibrant green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, thick stem with a rough, fibrous texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright from the base of the rosette. Its flowers are clustered in a spike, with bright yellow petals and a spadix, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry that contains small, black seeds, which are dispersed by birds and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients.</p>
