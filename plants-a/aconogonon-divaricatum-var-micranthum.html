<p>Aconogonon divaricatum var. micranthum, commonly known as the narrow-flowered aconogonon, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces delicate, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of racemes of bracteate flowers, which are often mistaken for true flowers due to their appearance.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant, dainty blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconogonon divaricatum var. micranthum has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 2â€“5 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, creeping or ascending, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in loose inflorescences, featuring pinkish-white petals and stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release minute seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconogonon divaricatum var. micranthum is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is currently found only in specific regions of the eastern part of the island, particularly in the northeastern area. This species thrives in moist, shaded forest environments, often growing in rocky or clayey soils. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
