                    <h1>Argyreia hanningtonii</h1>
<p>Argyreia hanningtonii, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvet bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered an invasive species in some areas.</p>
