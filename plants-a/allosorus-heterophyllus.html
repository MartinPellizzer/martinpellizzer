                    <h1>Allosorus heterophyllus</h1>
<p>Allosorus heterophyllus, commonly known as the variable bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to produce bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant exhibits morphological variation in its leaves, which can be filamentous or broad depending on environmental conditions. It is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by capturing prey to supplement its nutrient intake.</p>
