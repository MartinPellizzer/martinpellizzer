                <h1>Actinocephalus armeria</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus armeria, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, silver-gray leaves and showy, blue to purple flower heads that resemble small holly berries. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Actinocephalus armeria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy, drought-resistant nature.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus armeria has leaves that are oblanceolate, with a pointed tip and a broad base, arranged in a basal rosette, and are typically gray-green in color with a fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and covered with a rough, hairy texture, and it grows from the base with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, white or pale pink, with five petals and a central yellow stamen, blooming in spring and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus armeria is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa and Namibia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky outcrops, coastal areas, and sandy soils. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in regions with low rainfall. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the western and southern parts of these countries.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus armeria was mainly introduced to coastal and saline environments due to its tolerance of harsh conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high salinity and poor soil drainage. This plant has been reported in several regions, including parts of Australia and the Mediterranean. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its ability to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>It is often used for erosion control in coastal zones.</p>
