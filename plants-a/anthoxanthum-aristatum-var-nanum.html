                    <h1>Anthoxanthum aristatum var. nanum</h1>
<p>Anthoxanthum aristatum var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf oatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats, with small, narrow leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, pale-yellow to brownish flowers, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its fine texture and ability to form attractive ground cover.</p>
