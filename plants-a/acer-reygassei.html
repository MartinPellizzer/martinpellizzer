                <h1>Acer reygassei</h1>
<p>Acer reygassei, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental foliage, which changes color with the seasons. The tree typically grows to a height of 5â€“10 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a vibrant green hue in summer and brilliant red, orange, or yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>Acer reygassei is widely cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value and adaptability to various climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer reygassei has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and arranged in clusters along the stems. Its fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed capsule that disperses by wind, allowing the seeds to travel several meters from the parent plant.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer reygassei is a rare and unique maple species native to the mountainous regions of western China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including botanical gardens in Europe and North America. This species thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically found in forested areas. It grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Acer reygassei is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer reygassei is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and unique foliage structure.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of Acer reygassei includes a period of rapid growth in spring, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent watering, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally suffer from aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with appropriate insecticides.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and provide beneficial ground cover.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer reygassei is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration, offering significant ecological benefits to its environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer reygassei is a species of maple tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds may have minor uses in traditional herbal practices. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to the timber and paper industries due to its strong and durable wood. Culturally, it is often valued for its aesthetic appeal in landscaping and garden design.</p>
<p>Symbolically, it represents resilience and beauty in regions where it is native.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer reygassei has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Orange Queen' and 'Red Sunset', which display vibrant autumn colors.</p>
<p>While it is primarily a species with limited natural hybrids, some horticulturalists have attempted crossbreeding to enhance its traits.
