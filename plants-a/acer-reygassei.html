                <h1>Acer reygassei</h1>
<p>Acer reygassei, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, palmately lobed leaves that change color with the seasons, ranging from green to red, orange, and yellow. The plant belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens and landscapes. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 meters, with a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark.</p>
<p>Acer reygassei thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for temperate climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer reygassei has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, turning vibrant red or orange in the fall. The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during early spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule that disperses by wind, and the roots are fibrous, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer reygassei is a rare and critically endangered maple species native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>Although its native range was once more widespread, its current distribution is extremely limited, with only a few isolated populations remaining in the wild. It thrives in humid, temperate environments with well-drained soils, typically found in mixed forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and fragmentation, Acer reygassei is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer reygassei is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its striking foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. The growth cycle of Acer reygassei is relatively slow, with new growth appearing in spring and foliage turning vibrant in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization should be minimal, with a balanced fertilizer applied in early spring, while pruning is mainly done to shape the tree and remove dead or diseased branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or groundcovers can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a healthy ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer reygassei is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring blossoms and abundant nectar. Its dense canopy acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing biodiversity and offering microhabitat diversity. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the local ecosystem by improving soil quality through leaf litter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer reygassei is a species of maple tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds may have minor uses in traditional recipes in certain regions. In medicinal contexts, it has been studied for potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, though more research is needed. Industrially, its wood is valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal, contributing to the furniture and construction industries.</p>
<p>Culturally, it serves as a symbol of resilience and adaptability in some communities, often featured in local art and landscaping.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer reygassei has several varieties and cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, with popular cultivars such as 'Autumn Flame' and 'Red River' standing out for their vibrant fall color.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species to create unique foliage patterns and improved hardiness. These hybrids often exhibit enhanced growth characteristics and broader adaptability to different climates. Horticulturally, Acer reygassei is important for its aesthetic appeal in landscaping and its ability to thrive in urban environments.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids contribute significantly to the diversity of maples used in gardens and public spaces.</p>
