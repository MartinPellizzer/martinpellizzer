<p>Adenocalymma pohlianum, commonly known as the Pohlian's adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage is usually lance-shaped with a waxy texture, and it produces clusters of tubular flowers in shades of red and orange.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma pohlianum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma pohlianum has compound, pinnate leaves that are typically oval to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green color and a smooth texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a reddish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly hairy when young. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, with a simple structure and a blooming period during the summer months, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma pohlianum is primarily native to South America, specifically found in regions of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
