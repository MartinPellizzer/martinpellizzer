                <h1>Aconitum neotortuosum</h1>
<p>Aconitum neotortuosum, commonly known as the Neotortuous Monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive hood-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant features palmate leaves with a deep lobed structure, and its roots contain toxic alkaloids, making it a potentially dangerous species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and toxic properties, it is both a subject of botanical interest and a plant requiring careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum neotortuosum has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside; the leaves are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker and more fissured with age, and it grows upright with a tendency to branch near the base. The flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with spurred petals and arranged in racemes; they bloom in late summer to early autumn and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, adapted for absorbing moisture from the moist, cool environments where the plant thrives.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum neotortuosum is primarily native to Korea and Manchuria.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Aconitum neotortuosum is often associated with forested and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific geographic regions within East Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum neotortuosum was mainly introduced to North America through horticultural trade and intentional cultivation.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has spread beyond its original cultivation sites, establishing itself in natural habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it poses ecological risks due to its toxicity and competitive growth habits.</p>
