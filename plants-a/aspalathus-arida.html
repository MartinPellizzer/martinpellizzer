                <h1>Aspalathus arida</h1>
<p>Aspalathus arida, commonly known as the arid bushveld clover, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 30â€“60 cm and has small, leathery, elliptical leaves that are dark green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in umbels and attract various pollinators. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Aspalathus arida is often found in rocky outcrops and is an important component of the local flora in its habitat.</p>
