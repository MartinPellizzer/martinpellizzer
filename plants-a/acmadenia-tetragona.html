                <h1>Acmadenia tetragona</h1>
<p>Acmadenia tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled acmadenia, is a small shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from September to November. Its fruits are small, round, and dry, containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Acmadenia tetragona is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmadenia tetragona has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. The flowers are small, white or pale green, with a tubular structure and four lobes, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia tetragona is primarily native to the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal regions of this area, particularly in the fynbos biome. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in open habitats such as coastal dunes and shrublands. It is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, characterized by wet winters and dry summers.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species within the Cape Provinces.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia tetragona was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or loamy soils, typically in regions with a temperate to warm climate.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is commonly found in open woodlands or shrublands. This plant is often associated with coastal areas and can tolerate light salt spray, making it suitable for coastal restoration projects. It has been introduced in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely influenced by human activity, such as landscaping and ecological restoration efforts.</p>
