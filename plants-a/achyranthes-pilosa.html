                <h1>Achyranthes pilosa</h1>
<p>Achyranthes pilosa, commonly known as hairy knotweed, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features upright, branching stems that are often hairy, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its fibrous roots, which can be used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes pilosa has ovate to lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with rough, hairy texture, and has a reddish-brown color, growing upright with branching patterns. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with greenish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, dark brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes pilosa is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Nigeria, Sudan, and Kenya.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of southern Asia, including India and Sri Lanka. This plant thrives in moist, fertile soils and is commonly found in grasslands and along riverbanks. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to humid climates with distinct wet and dry seasons.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes pilosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand as part of the European flora during the 19th century.</p>
<p>It was brought for its ornamental value and potential as a forage plant. The plant has since spread across various habitats, including disturbed soils and roadside areas. It is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to establish itself in new environments.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
