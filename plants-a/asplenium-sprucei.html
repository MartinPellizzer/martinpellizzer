<p>Asplenium sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. Native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium sprucei is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to indoor conditions.</p>
