                <h1>Adenocarpus frankenioides</h1>
<p>Adenocarpus frankenioides, commonly known as the Frankenioides bursera, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae, which includes frankincense and myrrh trees. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It has a woody stem with a rough, bark-like surface, and its leaves are often covered in a fine, powdery coating.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus frankenioides has leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a bushy growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white or pale pink petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus frankenioides is primarily native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces. This plant thrives in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, often in areas with low rainfall. It is well adapted to the harsh, dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpus frankenioides was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands, dunes, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in coastal and inland regions with a Mediterranean climate. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions and can tolerate moderate salinity, making it suitable for coastal environments. It is often seen growing along roadsides, railway tracks, and other human-altered landscapes.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range, sometimes becoming invasive in local ecosystems.</p>
