                    <h1>Andryala lyrata f. sordida</h1>
<p>Andryala lyrata f. sordida, commonly known as the sordid leafy andryala, is a rare variant of the Andryala lyrata species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are typically smaller and more densely packed than those of the typical form. The plant is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters during the late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
