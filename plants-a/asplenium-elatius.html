<p>Asplenium elatius, commonly known as the broad buck's foot, is a perennial fern native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aspleniaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rock crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in rows.</p>
<p>Asplenium elatius is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate a range of growing conditions.</p>
