                <h1>Acnistus cerasus</h1>
<p>Acnistus cerasus, commonly known as cherry elder or red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense thickets. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries in the fall. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic seeds and should be consumed with caution.</p>
<p>The shrub is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus cerasus has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 2â€“5 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plant's growth. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers with four petals, arranged in clusters, blooming in early spring, and they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, red drupe that ripens in late summer, dispersing its seeds through animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus cerasus is primarily native to parts of East Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in woodland and forest areas, particularly in regions with a tropical or subtropical climate. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with secondary growth habitats. It is also known to occur in parts of South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely confined to the African continent, with limited records outside of this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus cerasus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. However, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native plants in various ecosystems. The distribution of this plant has spread throughout the North Island, particularly in areas with disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets have raised concerns among conservationists.</p>
