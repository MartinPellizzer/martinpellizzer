                    <h1>Acnistus cerasus</h1>
<p>Acnistus cerasus, commonly known as cherry elder or red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense thickets. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries in the fall. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic seeds and should be consumed with caution.</p>
<p>The shrub is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
