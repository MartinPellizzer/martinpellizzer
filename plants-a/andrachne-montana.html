                    <h1>Andrachne montana</h1>
<p>Andrachne montana, commonly known as mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid or rocky habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Andrachne montana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
