<p>Arenaria deflexa subsp.</p>
<p>pubescens, commonly known as the hairy sand-verbena, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which provide a degree of drought tolerance and protection from wind erosion. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local wildlife.</p>
