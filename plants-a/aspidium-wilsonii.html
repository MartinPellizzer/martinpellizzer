<p>Aspidium wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Aspidium wilsonii plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
