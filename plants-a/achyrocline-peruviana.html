                <h1>Achyrocline peruviana</h1>
<p>Achyrocline peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of white or pale yellow.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline peruviana has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a rough, hairy texture on the upper surface and a woolly underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 2–5 cm long and 1–2 cm wide, with a dark green color that often has a bluish tinge. The stem is slender, erect, and slightly woody, with a grayish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly fissured. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale blue petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline peruviana is primarily native to Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Andean regions of the country, particularly in the highlands and mountainous areas. This plant thrives in dry to semi-arid conditions, often growing in open fields and disturbed soils. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is known for its aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline peruviana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. The distribution of this plant has expanded beyond its original range, leading to its establishment in natural habitats. It is now found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and forest edges.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
