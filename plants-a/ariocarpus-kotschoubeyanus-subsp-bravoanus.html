<p>Ariocarpus kotschoubeyanus subsp.</p>
<p>bravoanus, commonly known as the Bravo's prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in spiny areoles, which bear clusters of white flowers.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, round, green fruits that are typically eaten by local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species.</p>
