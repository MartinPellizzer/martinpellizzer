                <h1>Acranthera hoangii</h1>
<p>Acranthera hoangii, commonly known as the Hoang's acranthera, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its botanical features include slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to its moist, tropical habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acranthera hoangii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera hoangii has leaves that are narrow and linear, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively unchanged throughout the plant's life. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in inflorescences, displaying a pale yellow to white color, and they bloom during the dry season, likely relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the surface layer of the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera hoangii is primarily native to Vietnam.</p>
<p>This rare orchid species is found in specific regions within the country, particularly in the northern and central areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountainous forests and humid valleys. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered an endemic species of Vietnam.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are essential to protect its habitat from degradation and loss.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera hoangii was mainly introduced to the Greater Sydney region of Australia.</p>
<p>It was introduced as part of a botanical study to assess its adaptability to local environmental conditions. The plant has since been observed growing in disturbed soils and along road edges. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Further monitoring is required to determine its long-term ecological impact.</p>
