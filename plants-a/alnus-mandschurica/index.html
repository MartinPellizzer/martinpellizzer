                            <h1>Alnus Mandschurica</h1>
<p>Chinese alder, scientifically known as Alnus mandschurica, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is commonly found in China, Korea, and Russia, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This plant is valued for its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in reforestation and soil enrichment. Its small, inconspicuous flowers give way to cone-like fruits that attract various wildlife. With its ecological benefits and adaptability, the Chinese alder plays a significant role in its native ecosystems.</p>
