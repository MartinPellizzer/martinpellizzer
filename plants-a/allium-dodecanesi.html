                    <h1>Allium dodecanesi</h1>
<p>Allium dodecanesi, commonly known as the Dodecanese garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the Greek island of Rhodes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a distinctive garlic-like scent. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and mild flavor, though it is less commonly used in cooking compared to other allium species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
