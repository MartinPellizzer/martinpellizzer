                <h1>Acer longipes subsp. amplum</h1>
<p>Acer longipes subsp.</p>
<p>amplum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically 5-9 lobes and have a distinctive, broad shape.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer longipes subsp.</p>
<p>amplum has palmately lobed leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and smooth with a greyish-brown bark that peels in thin flakes.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer longipes subsp.</p>
<p>amplum is a rare and specialized plant native to the eastern Himalayas, primarily found in regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. Its current distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these areas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This subspecies typically grows in dense forests at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its dwindling populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer longipes subsp.</p>
<p>amplum is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its unique foliage and slow growth. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity over several decades, making it suitable for long-term landscape planning.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications in spring, and pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other shade-loving plants like ferns or hostas can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer longipes subsp.</p>
<p>amplum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to biodiversity in its ecosystem. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, supporting the local pollination network.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through mutualistic relationships. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the ground in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in improving soil quality by facilitating nutrient cycling and supporting a healthy microbial community.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer longipes subsp.</p>
<p>amplum is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas. It has potential medicinal applications due to its rich content of antioxidants and flavonoids, which may support health benefits.</p>
<p>While not widely used in industrial applications, its wood could be valued for fine woodworking or as a source of timber in local economies. Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in regions where it is native, representing resilience or natural beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, its role remains largely ecological and traditional, with further research needed to explore its full potential.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer longipes subsp.</p>
<p>amplum has a limited number of recognized varieties, but it is more widely cultivated through various cultivars and hybrids. Popular cultivars include 'Aconitifolium' and 'Carnosum', which are prized for their unique foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Hybrids involving this species are relatively rare, but they often combine the hardiness of Acer longipes with the aesthetic traits of other maple species. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance, particularly in regions with cooler climates where they add visual interest to gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Their adaptability and visual appeal make them valuable additions to the horticultural palette.</p>
