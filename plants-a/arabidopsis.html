                    <h1>Arabidopsis</h1>
<p>Arabidopsis, commonly known as thale cress, is a small flowering plant native to Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is widely recognized for its simple genome and rapid life cycle, making it a model organism in plant biology. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces tiny white flowers. Its roots are often studied for their role in plant development and stress responses.</p>
<p>Arabidopsis is particularly valuable in genetic research due to its ease of cultivation and genetic simplicity.</p>
