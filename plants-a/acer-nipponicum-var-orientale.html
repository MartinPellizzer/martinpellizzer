                <h1>Acer nipponicum var. orientale</h1>
<p>Acer nipponicum var. orientale, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ornamental foliage, which displays vibrant red, orange, and yellow hues in the autumn. The tree typically grows to a height of 6–12 meters, with a rounded crown and smooth, light-gray bark. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with finely toothed margins, and are typically 5–10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The plant prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer nipponicum var. orientale has palmately compound leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and measuring approximately 10-15 cm in length, displaying a vibrant green color during the growing season and turning yellow to orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with smooth, greyish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures, and it exhibits a pyramidal growth pattern when young, becoming more spreading with age. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree, and it is wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, allowing the seeds to travel several meters from the parent tree.</p>
<p>The root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer nipponicum var. orientale is a variant of the Japanese maple native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Japan.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu, where it thrives in temperate climates. Currently, it is also cultivated in gardens and parks across the United States and Europe, though it remains most commonly found in its native habitat. This plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in mixed forests at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>It is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, though its natural populations are threatened by habitat loss and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer nipponicum var. orientale is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and elegant form.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The tree grows slowly, reaching maturity over several decades, and thrives in USDA hardiness zones 5 to 8.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and provide beneficial ground cover.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
