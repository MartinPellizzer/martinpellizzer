                <h1>Acanthus mollis var. niger</h1>
<p>Acanthus mollis var. niger, commonly known as the black acanthus, is a striking ornamental plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black foliage and its large, palmate leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, spiny flower spikes in late summer, featuring purple to reddish bracts. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its salt tolerance.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in landscape design for its dramatic appearance and hardy nature.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acanthus mollis var. niger has large, deeply lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a broad, upright arrangement along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age, and it grows in a bushy, upright pattern. The plant produces showy, spiky inflorescences composed of small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and form a dense network that helps anchor the plant and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthus mollis var. niger is a striking evergreen perennial shrub native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>It is now cultivated in gardens across the temperate regions of the world, including parts of North America and Australia. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal environments. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to approximately 600 meters.</p>
<p>While it is not currently listed as endangered, its wild populations are becoming increasingly rare due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acanthus mollis var. niger is a striking ornamental plant known for its velvety, dark purple foliage and dramatic, spiky flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with the latter method being more reliable for maintaining the variety's characteristics. This perennial grows best in full sun to partial shade, thriving in well-drained, fertile soil and requiring regular watering during dry periods.</p>
<p>Fertilize it in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune dead foliage in late winter to encourage new growth. It is relatively pest and disease resistant, though it may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with plants like lavender or rosemary can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acanthus mollis var. niger is a hardy perennial plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, spiky flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its dense foliage. Its deep roots help with erosion control by stabilizing soil along slopes and banks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by offering habitat and nectar sources in both natural and cultivated landscapes.</p>
