<p>Andropogon foveolatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands and swampy areas, thriving in moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Andropogon foveolatus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
