                <h1>Acronia rugosa</h1>
<p>Acronia rugosa, commonly known as the rough acronia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically pink or white, with five petals and stamens that are arranged in a showy display.</p>
<p>Acronia rugosa is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia rugosa has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia rugosa is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including parts of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils along coastal areas and tidal marshes. This species is commonly found in salt marshes and estuarine environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife. Acronia rugosa is adapted to brackish water conditions and can tolerate periodic flooding.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the unique hydrological features of the southeastern coastal plain.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia rugosa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and abandoned agricultural lands.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high sunlight exposure and well-drained soil conditions. The plant is commonly found in the eastern and central United States, where it has established itself in both natural and human-altered environments. Its introduction has been associated with its ability to spread quickly through wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in these regions and has not been widely documented as an invasive weed.</p>
