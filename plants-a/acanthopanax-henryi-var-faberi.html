                <h1>Acanthopanax henryi var. faberi</h1>
<p>Acanthopanax henryi var. faberi, commonly known as the Chinese devil's ivy, is a deciduous shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically odd-pinnate with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax henryi var. faberi has compound leaves that are odd-pinnate, with elongated leaflets that are typically elliptic or lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 2 to 6 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is grayish-brown in color, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern with branching occurring from the base. The flowers are small and clustered in umbellate inflorescences, with white or pale yellow petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry that contains several small seeds, and the seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax henryi var. faberi is a climbing shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, particularly in Sichuan, Hubei, and western Hunan provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of southern China and has been introduced to other regions for ornamental or medicinal purposes. It thrives in moist, temperate forests and rocky slopes, often growing in shaded undergrowth. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax henryi var. faberi is a climbing plant native to China, known for its ornamental value and medicinal uses.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining the desired varietal traits. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach full maturity, and thrives in partial shade to full sun.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and pruning to control growth and shape the plant are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other climbers or shrubs can enhance its growth and aesthetic appeal in the garden.</p>
