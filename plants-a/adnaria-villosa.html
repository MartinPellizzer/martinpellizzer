                <h1>Adnaria villosa</h1>
<p>Adnaria villosa, commonly known as the hairy adnaria, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria villosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a soft, velvety texture and a light green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and slightly woody, with a pale greenish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria villosa is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas, often found on rocky shores and cliffs. This plant is commonly associated with sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. It is well adapted to saline and arid conditions, making it a characteristic species of maritime environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the historical and current patterns of coastal ecosystems in the Mediterranean Basin.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria villosa was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has established itself in coastal and disturbed areas, often thriving in sandy or rocky soils. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread via seeds and vegetative propagation contribute to its invasive potential. It is now found in several regions, including parts of Europe and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
