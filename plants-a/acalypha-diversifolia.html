<p>Acalypha diversifolia, commonly known as the flame bush, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bright red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers clustered within the bracts. It thrives in humid, sunny environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Acalypha diversifolia is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
