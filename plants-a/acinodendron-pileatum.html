                <h1>Acinodendron pileatum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron pileatum, commonly known as the woolly acacia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are small, opposite, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs.</p>
<p>Acinodendron pileatum is typically found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to withstand periods of drought.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron pileatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, light gray bark that exudes a mild fragrance. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron pileatum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in lowland and hill forests, often found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. This plant is commonly associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats, making it a pioneer species in certain ecological contexts. Its distribution is limited to specific islands where the climate and soil conditions are suitable for its growth.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some parts of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron pileatum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including land clearing and gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
