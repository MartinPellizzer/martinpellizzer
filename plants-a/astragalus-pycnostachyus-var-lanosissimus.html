                    <h1>Astragalus pycnostachyus var. lanosissimus</h1>
<p>Astragalus pycnostachyus var. lanosissimus, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and its ability to thrive in poor, sandy soils. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense racemes. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, due to its tolerance for harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This species is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for wildlife.</p>
