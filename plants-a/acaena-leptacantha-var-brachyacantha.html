<p>Acaena leptacantha var. brachyacantha, commonly known as the short-stemmed common burr, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny fruiting structures that contain seeds enclosed in a fibrous, woody capsule. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of the distinctive burrs. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun.</p>
<p>This species is often found in coastal and inland areas, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
