                    <h1>Athyriopsis</h1>
<p>Athyriopsis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of small, evergreen ferns belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. They have delicate, finely divided fronds that often form dense mats, contributing to their ornamental appeal. Athyriopsis species are characterized by their rhizomatous growth habit and the presence of small, spore-producing structures called sori.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, many of which are valued in horticulture for their ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
