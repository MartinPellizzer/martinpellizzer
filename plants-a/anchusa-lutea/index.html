                            <h1>Anchusa Lutea</h1>
<p>Blueweed, scientifically known as Anchusa lutea, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. This species is celebrated for its vivid blue to violet blooms that appear in late spring to early summer. Its lance-shaped leaves and sturdy stems make it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Blueweed thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it relatively easy to cultivate. With its historical use in traditional medicine and its ornamental value, Anchusa lutea remains a fascinating subject of both botanical and cultural interest.</p>
