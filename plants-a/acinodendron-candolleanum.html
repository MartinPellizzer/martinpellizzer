                <h1>Acinodendron candolleanum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron candolleanum, commonly known as the Indian bignay, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, with a smooth surface and a slightly glossy appearance.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron candolleanum has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in dry, rocky environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron candolleanum is primarily native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of southern and western India, particularly in the states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in dense evergreen forests. It is commonly associated with rocky and lateritic soils in these regions.</p>
<p>Its natural range is limited to specific ecological niches within the Western Ghats, making it a regionally significant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron candolleanum was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and on sandy soils, particularly in the Western Cape. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed environments. Due to its invasive nature, it has been classified as a weed in some parts of its range.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native vegetation and biodiversity.</p>
