<p>Arctium lappaceum, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple or pinkish flowers arranged in a composite head, which is typical of the daisy family. Its most distinctive feature is the spiky, burs-like fruits that cling to clothing and animal fur, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Native to Europe, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
