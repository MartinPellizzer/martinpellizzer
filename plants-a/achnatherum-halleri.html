                <h1>Achnatherum halleri</h1>
<p>Achnatherum halleri, commonly known as Haller's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky and arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in alpine and subalpine zones, where it contributes to the local vegetation.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its robust root system and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum halleri has narrow, grass-like leaves that are flat, parallel-veined, and typically arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a length ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and smooth, with a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in dense clumps or tufts. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences composed of small, two-lipped flowers that are usually pale green to brown, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry, three-angled achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum halleri is primarily native to Central Asia, including regions such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Russia, particularly in the western regions, and extends into northern India. This grass species typically grows in mountainous and semi-arid environments, often in open grasslands and rocky slopes. It is well adapted to harsh climatic conditions and is commonly found at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 4,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in many of its native regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum halleri was mainly introduced to North America through human activities such as seed contamination in agricultural products and intentional cultivation for ornamental or ecological purposes.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides, fields, and abandoned sites across the United States and Canada. The plant has adapted well to a variety of soil types and climatic conditions, allowing it to spread rapidly in new environments. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution continues to expand, raising concerns about its impact on native plant communities.</p>
