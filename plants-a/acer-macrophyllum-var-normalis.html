                <h1>Acer macrophyllum var. normalis</h1>
<p>Acer macrophyllum var. normalis, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a deciduous tree native to western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces showy, clusters of red flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>The Pacific madrone is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum var. normalis has broad, palmately lobed leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture and a size ranging from 10 to 20 centimeters in diameter.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and has a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in water absorption and soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum var. normalis is a variant of the bigleaf maple that is native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, specifically found in regions of Washington, Oregon, and northern California.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it is now cultivated in various parts of the United States and Canada, particularly in gardens and parks that mimic its natural environment. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in riparian zones, moist woodlands, and along stream banks. It typically grows at elevations ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters, preferring temperate climates with ample rainfall.</p>
<p>Currently, it is not listed as threatened, but its natural habitat faces pressures from urban development and habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum var. normalis is a deciduous shrub or small tree known for its large, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant fall color.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through softwood cuttings taken in early summer or by seeds collected in the fall. The growth cycle includes rapid growth during the spring and summer, followed by a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry spells. Fertilize it with a balanced fertilizer in early spring, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and encourage new growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions, and it pairs well with other shade-loving plants like ferns and hostas.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum var. normalis is a vital component of riparian and forest ecosystems, providing food and shelter for a variety of wildlife.</p>
<p>Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, while its dense foliage offers nesting sites for birds and small mammals. The plant acts as a natural erosion control measure due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil along streambanks. Additionally, it serves as a companion plant in shaded environments, supporting biodiversity by creating microhabitats.</p>
<p>Its ecological benefits extend beyond its immediate surroundings, contributing to overall habitat complexity and ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum var. normalis is a species of maple native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, known for its large, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant fall coloration.</p>
<p>While it is primarily valued for its ornamental use in landscaping and gardens, it has limited culinary applications, with its leaves occasionally used in traditional Native American cooking. In medicinal contexts, it has been used by indigenous communities for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, it contributes to local economies through horticulture and ecological tourism.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest and is often featured in regional art and literature.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer macrophyllum var. normalis has several popular cultivars such as 'Emerald Queen' and 'Coral Beauty', which are prized for their vibrant foliage and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>It also has hybrids with other maple species, producing plants that exhibit enhanced ornamental traits and improved hardiness. These varieties are widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes for their aesthetic appeal. Their ability to thrive in various climates makes them valuable additions to horticultural collections.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer macrophyllum var. normalis holds significant horticultural importance due to its versatility and visual impact.</p>
