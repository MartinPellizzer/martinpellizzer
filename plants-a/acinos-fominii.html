                <h1>Acinos fominii</h1>
<p>Acinos fominii, commonly known as the Fomin's cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky and arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh climates. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat. Its leaves are alternate, with a distinctive five-lobed shape, giving it the common name "cinquefoil.".</p>
<p>Acinos fominii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine setting.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos fominii has small, gray-green leaves that are oblanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure around 1â€“2 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, pale gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a cushion-like form. The flowers are white to pale pink, clustered in dense umbels, and bloom in early summer; they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos fominii is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This plant is adapted to cold climates and is often found in areas with well-drained soils. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is known for its small, daisy-like flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos fominii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and rocky habitats, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as Central Asia, the Caucasus, and parts of Eastern Europe. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous landscapes. It is typically introduced to new areas through human activity, such as agricultural expansion or accidental transport.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited by its specific ecological requirements and environmental conditions.</p>
