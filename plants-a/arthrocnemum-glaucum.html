                    <h1>Arthrocnemum glaucum</h1>
<p>Arthrocnemum glaucum, commonly known as the saltbush or desert sandplant, is a halophytic shrub adapted to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It possesses succulent, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant's stems are often branched and covered in a waxy cuticle, further enhancing its drought tolerance. It produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Arthrocnemum glaucum plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and is commonly found in desert regions of Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia.</p>
