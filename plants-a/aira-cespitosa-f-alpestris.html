                    <h1>Aira cespitosa f. alpestris</h1>
<p>Aira cespitosa f. alpestris, commonly known as alpine grass or alpine air grass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish spikelets that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in alpine ecosystems.</p>
