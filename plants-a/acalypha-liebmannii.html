The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange or red berries, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Acalypha liebmannii is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha liebmannii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and exhibits a reddish-brown color, with a branching growth pattern that allows for dense foliage. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green with red stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-chambered capsule that releases small, winged seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption in its arid habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha liebmannii is a species of flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
