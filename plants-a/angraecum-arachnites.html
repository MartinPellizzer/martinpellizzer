                    <h1>Angraecum arachnites</h1>
<p>Angraecum arachnites, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescence bearing numerous small, white, spider-like flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure is adapted for specific pollinators, such as the hawkmoth.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Angraecum arachnites is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
