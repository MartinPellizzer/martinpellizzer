                <h1>Aegilotrichum triticoides</h1>
<p>Aegilotrichum triticoides, commonly known as the wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rapid growth and high nutritional value make it a popular choice for forage and in some traditional herbal applications.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is classified in the Poaceae family, which includes other grasses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilotrichum triticoides has narrow, grass-like leaves that are flat, parallel-veined, and arranged in a basal rosette, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and covered with a smooth, pale green bark, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets with small, two-lipped flowers that are pale green to white, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds through wind, with each seed being small and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
