<p>Andropogon virginicus var. stenophyllus, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This variety is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically valuable.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that release lightweight seeds, facilitating wind dispersal.</p>
