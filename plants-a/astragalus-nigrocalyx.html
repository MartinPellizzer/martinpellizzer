<p>Astragalus nigrocalyx, commonly known as black calyx milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils and low moisture conditions. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, hard pods that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Astragalus nigrocalyx plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
