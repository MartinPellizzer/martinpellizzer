<p>Asplenium heterocarpum, commonly known as the heterocarpous spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant produces two types of sporangia—heterocarpous—on the same sporophylls, a unique feature among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in crevices.</p>
<p>Asplenium heterocarpum is typically found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
