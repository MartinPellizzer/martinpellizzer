                <h1>Acer pseudoplatanus f. spaethii</h1>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. spaethii, commonly known as the Späth's maple, is a distinctive cultivar of the common maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its uniquely shaped leaves, which are often deeply lobed and exhibit a striking contrast between the green upper surface and the pale, almost white underside. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of up to 6 meters. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, fertile soils.</p>
<p>This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value, particularly for its foliage color and unique leaf morphology.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. spaethii has leaves that are broadly ovate to rounded, with a serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and a medium size, typically 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green in summer and turn vibrant red or orange in autumn. The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a tree with a spreading habit.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, with two winged seeds, and it is dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. spaethii is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, particularly in parts of Austria and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations, primarily in high-altitude areas. This form thrives in temperate climates with moist, well-drained soils, often found in mixed forests and along stream valleys. It typically grows at elevations between 800 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern, with efforts underway to protect and propagate this unique genetic form.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. spaethii is a striking ornamental maple known for its vibrant fall color and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-hardwood cuttings in late summer or by seed, though the latter method is less common due to its slow germination. This tree grows best in full sun to partial shade, with a moderate growth cycle that typically reaches maturity within 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p>It requires well-drained soil and regular watering during dry periods, but it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and annual pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or ornamental grasses can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a healthy garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. spaethii is a decorative maple variety that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the aesthetic value of the landscape. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, its presence supports a microhabitat for insects and other small organisms, promoting ecological balance in the surrounding environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. spaethii is a decorative variety of maple known for its unique, variegated foliage, making it a popular choice in horticulture and ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>While it is not typically used in culinary applications, its aesthetic value contributes to the ornamental plant industry, supporting economic activities in gardening and landscape design. In traditional medicine, no specific medicinal uses are widely documented for this variety, though its close relatives have been used in herbal remedies. Culturally, it symbolizes beauty and resilience in garden design, often featured in public spaces and private collections.</p>
<p>Its role in urban greening also highlights its ecological contribution by improving air quality and providing habitat for urban wildlife.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
