<p>Aeschynomene indica var. viscosa, commonly known as sticky leaf aeschynomene, is a perennial leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop.</p>
