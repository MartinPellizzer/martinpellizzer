                    <h1>Arum vermitoxicum</h1>
<p>Arum vermitoxicum, commonly known as the toxic arrowroot, is a member of the Araceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and striking spatulate inflorescence. The plant contains calcium oxalate crystals, which can cause irritation upon contact with skin or ingestion. While its tubers are sometimes used in traditional medicine, they are generally considered toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
<p>Due to its poisonous nature, it is not recommended for cultivation in home gardens.</p>
