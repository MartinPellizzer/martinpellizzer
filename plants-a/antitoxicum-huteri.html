                    <h1>Antitoxicum huteri</h1>
<p>Antitoxicum huteri, commonly known as the Huter's antitoxic plant, is a rare and lesser-known species within the botanical world.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf structure, which features a waxy coating to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale green or yellow, adapted for specific pollinators. Its growth habit is primarily herbaceous, with a tendency to form low, sprawling mats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
