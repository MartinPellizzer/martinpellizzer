                    <h1>Aloe dewinteri</h1>
<p>Aloe dewinteri, commonly known as the White Aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, pale green leaves that store water, a characteristic of many desert plants. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Aloe dewinteri is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal watering once established.</p>
