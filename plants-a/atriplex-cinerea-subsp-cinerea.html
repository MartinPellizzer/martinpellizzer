<p>Atriplex cinerea subsp.</p>
<p>cinerea, commonly known as silverleaf shadscale, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, powdery hairs that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are succulent and often have a salty taste, which can be toxic to livestock.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to poor soils and is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities.</p>
