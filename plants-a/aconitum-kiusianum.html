                <h1>Aconitum kiusianum</h1>
<p>Aconitum kiusianum, commonly known as the Korean aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Korea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple spathaceous flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed divisions, and are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Aconitum kiusianum contains potent alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum kiusianum has large, compound leaves that are typically palmately arranged, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, dark brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with a spurred petal and are arranged in dense clusters, blooming in late summer; they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous, adapted for storage and anchoring the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum kiusianum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This species is well adapted to cold climates and is often found at elevations above 2,000 meters. It is commonly associated with arid and semi-arid conditions in these regions.</p>
<p>The plant is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum kiusianum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and along stream banks. The plant was likely introduced through horticultural trade or accidental spread from cultivated gardens. It has established itself in native ecosystems, sometimes competing with local flora.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is considered a potential invasive species in certain areas.</p>
