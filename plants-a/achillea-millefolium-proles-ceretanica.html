                <h1>Achillea millefolium proles ceretanica</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium proles ceretanica, commonly known as the lesser yarrow, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in dry, sunny environments such as meadows and rocky soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The plant has a long history of use in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium proles ceretanica has leaves that are finely divided, feather-like, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a silvery-green color and a size ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a pale green to reddish-brown color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are compound, consisting of small yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a cypsela, a type of dry, indehiscent achene, with seeds that are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and pappus structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium proles ceretanica is a subspecies of yarrow that is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>Currently, it is distributed across southern Europe, including countries such as Italy, Spain, and France, with some populations extending into the Middle East. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and rocky slopes, often in well-drained soils. This subspecies typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>It is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, as it is relatively common in its native range and not currently under significant threat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium proles ceretanica is a hardy perennial known for its finely divided leaves and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in the fall. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in early spring and blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogged roots. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its appearance. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot in poor conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or chamomile can enhance its growth and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium proles ceretanica is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering shelter and sustenance. This plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and supporting biodiversity in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium proles ceretanica is a variant of yarrow, known for its historical and contemporary uses across various domains.</p>
