                        <h1>Acalypha psilostachya</h1>
<p>Acalypha psilostachya, commonly known as the silky mallow, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, woolly leaves and showy, pinkish-red bracts that resemble flowers. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha psilostachya belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises a group of vascular plants that includes horsetails and includes species with jointed stems and annular leaf sheaths. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is characterized by a variety of floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large order of flowering plants that includes many species with distinctive floral morphology and diverse ecological adaptations. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse growth forms and often contains latex-producing species. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as the "velvetleaf" or "cupweed," characterized by their showy inflorescences and often hairy foliage.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha psilostachya, a specific type within the genus Acalypha, known for its unique morphological features and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha psilostachya is primarily native to Angola, Burundi, Cameroon, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Sudan-South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats. The plant is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>Its native range spans much of sub-Saharan Africa, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha psilostachya was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and wetland environments, often as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions of the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia. The plant spreads rapidly through its prolific seed production and can establish dense stands in riparian zones. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely influenced by human activity and changes in land use.</p>
