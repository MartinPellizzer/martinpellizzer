                    <h1>Aspidium fraseri</h1>
<p>Aspidium fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating in water. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, anchoring the plant and facilitating vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Aspidium fraseri plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
