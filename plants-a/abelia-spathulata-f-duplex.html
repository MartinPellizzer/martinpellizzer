                <h1>Abelia spathulata f. duplex</h1>
<p>Abelia spathulata f. duplex, commonly known as the double-flowered abelia, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter in color beneath. The plant produces showy, double flowers in late summer, featuring layers of white to pink petals that bloom in clusters. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, fertile soil.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abelia spathulata f. duplex has ovate to elliptic leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, greenish-brown in color, and have a smooth texture, with a growth pattern that is upright and somewhat spreading. The flowers are clustered in trusses, featuring five-lobed petals that are white with a pinkish tinge, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelia spathulata f. duplex is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China, specifically in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>Although it is primarily found in its native range, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including the United States and Europe, where it is cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, commonly growing in forest understories. This species is typically found at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and the threats posed by habitat loss, it is considered to be of conservation concern, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abelia spathulata f. duplex is a compact, ornamental shrub known for its fragrant, double flowers and attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-ripe cuttings in summer or by dividing the roots in early spring. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 2-3 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and consistent moisture, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize it in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune after flowering to maintain shape and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or sedum can enhance its appearance and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Abelia spathulata f. duplex is a valuable plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its dense foliage offers shelter and nesting sites for small birds and insects. It acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants by attracting beneficial insects. The plant also contributes to erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it supports local biodiversity by creating a habitat that attracts and sustains a variety of wildlife.</p>
