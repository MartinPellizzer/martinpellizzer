                <h1>Acourtia zacatecana</h1>
<p>Acourtia zacatecana, commonly known as the Zacatecan dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as cypsela, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Acourtia zacatecana is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in local communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia zacatecana has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a creeping growth pattern that allows it to spread along the ground. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green in color, with five petals and a tubular shape, blooming from spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when dry, and the seeds are tiny and wind-dispersed.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia zacatecana is a flowering plant native to Mexico, specifically found in the states of Jalisco, Michoac√°n, and Zacatecas.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, typically growing in rocky soils and open grasslands. This species is found at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited geographic range, Acourtia zacatecana is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acourtia zacatecana is a resilient, flowering plant native to Mexico, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The growth cycle of Acourtia zacatecana typically spans several months, with blooming occurring in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourage blooming. It is relatively resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acourtia zacatecana is a native plant of Mexico that provides food and shelter for various local wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of the local ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acourtia zacatecana supports soil stability and can improve the overall resilience of the surrounding environment.</p>
