                <h1>Acourtia zacatecana</h1>
<p>Acourtia zacatecana, commonly known as the Zacatecan acourtia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acourtia zacatecana is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia zacatecana has small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, with five petals and a tubular structure, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's arid habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia zacatecana is primarily native to Mexico Northeast and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often in desert or scrubland environments. Acourtia zacatecana is well adapted to the harsh climate conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these geographic regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia zacatecana was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and degraded grasslands.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in the southern United States, particularly in Texas and New Mexico. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including land clearing and agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
