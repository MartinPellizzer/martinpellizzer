                <h1>Achillea millefolium var. setacea</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. setacea, commonly known as the hairy yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. Its name derives from the Greek myth of Achilles, who supposedly used the plant to treat wounds.</p>
<p>The variety *setacea* is distinguished by its hairy, glandular leaves, which give it a distinctive texture and appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. setacea has leaves that are finely divided, feathery, and arranged in a basal rosette, with a bright green color and a delicate, silky texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green to pale yellowish color, growing in a compact, bushy pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in flat-topped umbels, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and pappus-like structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
