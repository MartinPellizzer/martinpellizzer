<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea feliciana has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are lance-shaped, with a silvery-white underside and a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, smooth, and greenish-gray in color, growing in a clumping pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a cypsela, dispersed by wind due to its pappus structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea feliciana is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>While it was historically confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including the United States and parts of Asia. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky soils and open woodlands. It typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its limited natural habitat makes it a species of interest for conservation efforts.</p>
