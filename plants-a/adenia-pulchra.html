                <h1>Adenia pulchra</h1>
<p>Adenia pulchra, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, waxy, purple-red flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a climbing habit, with woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Adenia pulchra is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia pulchra has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring up to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, pale greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. Its flowers are large, showy, and yellowish-green with red stamens, arranged in clusters, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are pollinated by birds and insects. The fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by animals eating the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensively branched, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia pulchra is primarily native to Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is found in the highland regions of the country, particularly in the southern and central areas. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within forests and woodlands. It is well adapted to the tropical and subtropical climate of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes areas with rich soil and adequate rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia pulchra was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces, often growing in rocky and coastal areas. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>However, its spread outside its native range is limited, and it does not pose a significant threat to local ecosystems.</p>
