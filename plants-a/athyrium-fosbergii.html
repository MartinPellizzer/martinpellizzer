<p>Athyrium fosbergii, commonly known as Fosberg's lady fern, is a perennial fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically arching and gracefully adorned with small, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat.</p>
