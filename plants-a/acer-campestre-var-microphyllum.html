                        <h1>Acer campestre var. microphyllum</h1>
<p>Acer campestre var. microphyllum, commonly known as the dwarf field maple, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are smaller than those of the typical field maple. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and used in landscape design.</p>
