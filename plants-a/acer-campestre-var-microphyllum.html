                        <h1>Acer campestre var. microphyllum</h1>
<p>Acer campestre var. microphyllum, commonly known as the dwarf field maple, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are smaller than those of the typical field maple. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and used in landscape design.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. microphyllum is primarily native to parts of Europe, including the British Isles, France, and northern Spain.</p>
<p>It is also found in some regions of northwest Africa, such as Morocco and Algeria. This variety of the common maple thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and hedgerows. It prefers well-drained soils and is commonly associated with limestone substrates.</p>
<p>Its small leaves and compact growth make it a distinctive and ornamental species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. microphyllum was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in urban and suburban landscapes, where it is valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This plant has been reported in several states, including Pennsylvania, New York, and Ohio, where it has established itself in both natural and disturbed habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain environments.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, its spread is closely monitored to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
