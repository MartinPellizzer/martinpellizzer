                <h1>Aconitum spathulatum</h1>
<p>Aconitum spathulatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive spatulate shape, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Aconitum spathulatum contains potent toxins, making it highly poisonous and requiring caution during handling or cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum spathulatum has large, spade-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and erect, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher as the plant matures. Its flowers are blue to purple, clustered in terminal racemes, and have a spurred structure, blooming in late summer; they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that releases small, flat seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients and surviving harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum spathulatum is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of this area. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments within its native range. It is often associated with forested areas and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the specific habitats of southern and central China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum spathulatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, showy flowers. Despite its beauty, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and can spread rapidly through its rhizomes.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
