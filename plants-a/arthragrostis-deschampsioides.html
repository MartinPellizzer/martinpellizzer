<p>Arthragrostis deschampsioides, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features fine, silver-tomentose leaves that give it a distinctive silvery appearance, especially when dry. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
