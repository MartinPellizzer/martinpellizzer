                    <h1>Aotus lanigera</h1>
<p>Aotus lanigera, commonly known as the woolly owl monkey, is a primate native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly fur that provides insulation in the humid tropical environment. The plant in question, however, does not exist; Aotus lanigera is an animal, not a plant. Therefore, there are no botanical aspects to discuss.</p>
<p>I can't reply.</p>
