                    <h1>Azorella linearifolia</h1>
<p>Azorella linearifolia, commonly known as the "Pine of the Andes," is a unique plant belonging to the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in cold and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it conserve moisture and withstand harsh weather conditions. Its leaves are linear and closely packed, forming a compact structure that reduces wind exposure.</p>
<p>Azorella linearifolia is also notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
