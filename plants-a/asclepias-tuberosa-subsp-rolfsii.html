<p>Asclepias tuberosa subsp.</p>
<p>rolfsii, commonly known as the yellow milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy and bear clusters of bright yellow flowers with distinctive, milky sap-filled structures called glands.</p>
<p>The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds attached to silky, parachute-like hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture with prominent veins.</p>
<p>This subspecies is particularly valued for its role in supporting monarch butterfly populations, as it serves as a host plant for their larvae.</p>
