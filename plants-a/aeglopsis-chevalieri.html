                <h1>Aeglopsis chevalieri</h1>
<p>Aeglopsis chevalieri, commonly known as the Madagascar starfish plant, is a unique succulent native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, known for its diverse and often strikingly ornamental species. The plant features a compact, star-shaped rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. It produces small, star-like flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming in late winter or early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeglopsis chevalieri has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that exhibits a slightly fibrous texture and grows upright with minimal branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>
