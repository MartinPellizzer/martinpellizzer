                <h1>Adiantum oblique-truncatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum oblique-truncatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, arching fronds with a distinctive, narrow, and often slightly curved shape. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shady, moist environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its intricate foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and indoor plant collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum oblique-truncatum has fern-like leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 10 to 20 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are a bright green color with a smooth, waxy texture and possess a distinctive oblique-truncate shape at the base. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a vertical pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish in color, blooming in late spring, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, and the roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's spread and anchoring.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum oblique-truncatum is primarily native to southern China, including regions such as Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Southeast Asia, including Vietnam and the Philippines. This fern typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous areas with high humidity. It is commonly found in forest understories and along streams or rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to these specific geographic areas, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum oblique-truncatum was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. This fern is often spread through the movement of spores carried by wind or water. It has been reported in several states, including Pennsylvania, New York, and Tennessee.</p>
<p>Its presence in these areas is considered non-native, and it is sometimes classified as an invasive species.</p>
