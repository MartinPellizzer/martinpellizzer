                    <h1>Artemisia stracheyi</h1>
<p>Artemisia stracheyi, commonly known as Strachey's wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves with a strong, pungent odor. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh, desert environments.</p>
<p>Artemisia stracheyi is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements and ecological benefits.</p>
