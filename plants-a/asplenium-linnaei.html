                    <h1>Asplenium linnaei</h1>
<p>Asplenium linnaei, commonly known as the Linnaeus's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, clustered near the leaf tips.</p>
<p>Asplenium linnaei is characterized by its simple, non-branching fronds and is often found in rocky or forested habitats.</p>
