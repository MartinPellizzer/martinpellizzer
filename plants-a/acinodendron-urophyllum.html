                <h1>Acinodendron urophyllum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron urophyllum, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, preferring cool and humid climates. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered with a fine pubescence, while its stems are woody and often branched.</p>
<p>Acinodendron urophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron urophyllum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exhibits a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron urophyllum is primarily native to the western regions of the United States, particularly in California and parts of Nevada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments with well-drained soils. It is often associated with rocky outcrops and slopes in these areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron urophyllum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and abandoned fields. The plant thrives in regions with high humidity and warm temperatures, making it a common invader in agricultural landscapes. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction contribute to its successful establishment.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a concern in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
