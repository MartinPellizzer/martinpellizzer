                <h1>Adenostemma swartzii</h1>
<p>Adenostemma swartzii, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a red or purple calyx. It is adapted to arid environments and has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Adenostemma swartzii is also known for its milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma swartzii has leaves that are typically lanceolate or elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 3 to 8 cm in length and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a light green to reddish-brown color, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with tubular corollas and a coloration of pale purple to white, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, ellipsoid seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma swartzii is primarily native to the southern United States, specifically Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, woodlands, and along roadsides. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in well-drained soils. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Acanthaceae and is known for its showy, tubular flowers.</p>
<p>Adenostemma swartzii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in disturbed areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma swartzii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and parts of Nevada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, pastures, and abandoned fields. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats and is often associated with native grasslands and shrublands. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various ecological communities, sometimes outcompeting native species.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in agricultural and natural areas across its range.</p>
