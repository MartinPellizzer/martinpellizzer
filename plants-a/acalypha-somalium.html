                        <h1>Acalypha somalium</h1>
<p>Acalypha somalium, commonly known as the Somali copperleaf, is a flowering plant native to East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking copper-colored bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are ovate with a waxy texture and a deep green color.</p>
<p>Acalypha somalium thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha somalium is primarily native to the Horn of Africa, including countries such as Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in rocky soils or along dry riverbeds. This plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions and can thrive in areas with low rainfall. It is often seen in coastal and inland regions where the climate is hot and dry.</p>
<p>Acalypha somalium plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha somalium was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was first brought there in the early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking to diversify local landscapes. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it well-suited to the environmental conditions of these regions.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction have contributed to its widespread establishment.</p>
