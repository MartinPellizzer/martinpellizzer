                    <h1>Arctium niveum</h1>
<p>Arctium niveum, commonly known as the common hogweed, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs and its tall, hollow stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by spiny, burr-like fruits. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
