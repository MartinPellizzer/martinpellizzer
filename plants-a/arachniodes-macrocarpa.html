<p>Arachniodes macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant spider fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, pinnately compound leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length, with a distinctive, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, finger-like leaflets. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>Arachniodes macrocarpa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant in warm climates.</p>
