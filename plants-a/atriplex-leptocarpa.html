                    <h1>Atriplex leptocarpa</h1>
<p>Atriplex leptocarpa, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it highly drought-tolerant. The plant produces green to yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-excreting leaves help it thrive in saline soils, contributing to its ecological importance in stabilizing soils.</p>
<p>Atriplex leptocarpa is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to reclaim degraded lands.</p>
