<p>Arundarbor lineata, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces elegant, tubular flowers in shades of purple and blue, which attract specific pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive prolonged dry periods.</p>
<p>Arundarbor lineata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
