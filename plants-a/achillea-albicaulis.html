<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has feathery, finely divided leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in the summer.</p>
<p>White yarrow is often used in traditional herbal medicine and as a decorative garden plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea albicaulis has basal,丛生 leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, with a silver-gray to whitish color, and are arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and smooth with a pale green to grayish-brown color, exhibiting a growth pattern of spreading or clumping. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea albicaulis is a flowering plant native to the western United States, specifically found in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas within its native range, though it is less common today due to habitat loss. It thrives in dry, open environments such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and coastal dunes. This species typically grows at elevations between 0 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>It is listed as a species of concern in some areas due to its limited distribution and habitat fragmentation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea albicaulis is a hardy perennial plant known for its silver-gray foliage and delicate white flowers, commonly grown in rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The growth cycle of Achillea albicaulis involves a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in the spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning spent flower heads encourages new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender, yarrow, or sedum can enhance its ornamental value and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
