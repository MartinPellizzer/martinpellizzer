                <h1>Achillea albicaulis</h1>
<p>Achillea albicaulis, commonly known as white yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It is perennial, with a compact growth habit and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea albicaulis has leaves that are gray-green in color, linear to lanceolate in shape, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a soft, fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, branching, and covered with a whitish, hairy coating, growing in a clumping pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry achene, and seeds are dispersed by wind due to their small size and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea albicaulis is a flowering plant native to the western United States, specifically found in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas along the coastal ranges and valleys of these states. It thrives in dry, open environments such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea albicaulis is a hardy perennial plant known for its fluffy white flowers and silver-gray foliage, commonly cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the roots in early spring or by sowing seeds directly into the soil in late summer. This plant has a biennial growth cycle, though it often behaves as a short-lived perennial, blooming in its second year before dying back.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid over-saturation. Minimal fertilization is needed, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if conditions are too wet.</p>
<p>Companion planting with aromatic herbs like lavender or thyme can help repel pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea albicaulis is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both nectar and habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its beneficial properties. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity of an ecosystem by supporting a range of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
