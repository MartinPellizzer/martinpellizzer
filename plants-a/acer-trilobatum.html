The tree produces small, yellow-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant fall foliage.</p>
