                <h1>Acer trilobatum</h1>
<p>Acer trilobatum, commonly known as the three-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves with three distinct lobes, which are typically bright green during the growing season. The tree produces small, yellow-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant fall foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer trilobatum has leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate and having three lobes, arranged alternately along the stem, and they are typically 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub with a rounded crown. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with yellowish-green sepals and red stamens, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara with two wings, dispersing by wind, and the seeds are small and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer trilobatum is a rare and endemic maple species native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including parts of Southeast Asia and North America, where it is cultivated in botanical gardens. This plant thrives in temperate climates, often found in moist, shaded forests with well-drained soil. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, where cool temperatures and high humidity prevail.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Acer trilobatum is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer trilobatum is a small deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer trilobatum includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by flowering in early summer and leaf fall in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it benefits from companion planting with flowering shrubs to enhance its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer trilobatum is a small deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring flowers. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its dense foliage offers shade and protection, contributing to habitat diversity.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer trilobatum is a species of maple native to East Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While its fruits are not commonly used in culinary applications, the tree contributes to local biodiversity and provides habitat for wildlife. In traditional medicine, various parts of the tree have been used to treat ailments such as inflammation and respiratory issues. Its aesthetic appeal makes it a popular choice for landscaping and urban forestry, enhancing cultural and environmental landscapes.</p>
<p>Economically, it supports the timber and horticulture industries, though its industrial applications are limited compared to other maple species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer trilobatum has several popular cultivars, such as 'Crimson King' and 'Autumn Flame', which are prized for their vibrant fall color and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species to create cultivars that exhibit enhanced ornamental traits, such as improved cold hardiness and more intense foliage colors. These hybrids often show greater adaptability to different climates, making them valuable in horticultural settings. The plant's unique trifoliate leaves and seasonal color changes contribute to its horticultural importance in ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance, Acer trilobatum remains a sought-after choice for landscapers and gardeners alike.</p>
