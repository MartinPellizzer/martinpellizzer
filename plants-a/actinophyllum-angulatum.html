                <h1>Actinophyllum angulatum</h1>
<p>Actinophyllum angulatum, commonly known as the angular actinophyllum, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, woolly leaves and produces clusters of pale yellow to green flowers. It is typically found in coastal regions and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinophyllum angulatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, pale grey bark that has a somewhat fibrous texture. Its flowers are small, white to pale pink, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom from late winter to early spring, relying on wind for pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, and the plant has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophyllum angulatum is primarily native to southern Australia, particularly in the states of South Australia and Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils within coastal dunes and heathlands. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open, sun-exposed areas. It is well adapted to withstand drought and salt spray, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The plant is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of its region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophyllum angulatum was mainly introduced to urban and suburban areas in southern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and South Australia.</p>
<p>It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found along roadsides, railway lines, and in garden landscapes. This plant is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and rhizomes. Its introduction has led to competition with native flora in invaded habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental foliage.</p>
