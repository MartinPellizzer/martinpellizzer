                <h1>Achyrocline polycephala</h1>
<p>Achyrocline polycephala, commonly known as the clustered achyrocline, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typical sunflower-like structure. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and saline environments. Its small, white to pale blue flowers bloom in clusters, and the plant is often found in dune habitats.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing coastal dunes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline polycephala has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically light green in color and have a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, often hairy, and grows upright with a somewhat woody texture, while the bark is thin and grayish in color. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with tubular corollas and five lobes, usually pink to purple in color, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry environments where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline polycephala is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in coastal and lowland habitats. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with dry to moist forests. It is also present in some regions of South America, such as Brazil and Venezuela.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to warm, humid climates with ample sunlight.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline polycephala was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species that has spread across various ecosystems there. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands pose a threat to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect native plant communities.</p>
