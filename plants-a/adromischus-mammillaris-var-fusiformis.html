<p>Adromischus mammillaris var. fusiformis, commonly known as the football cactus, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a swollen, rounded stem that resembles a football, with small, spiny tubercles covering its surface. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens.</p>
