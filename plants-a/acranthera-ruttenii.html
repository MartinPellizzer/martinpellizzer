                <h1>Acranthera ruttenii</h1>
<p>Acranthera ruttenii, commonly known as the Rutten's acranthera, is a perennial herb native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera ruttenii has small, narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a smooth, waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and stout, with a rough, hairy bark that is typically grayish-brown in color. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when the pod matures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soils it inhabits.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera ruttenii is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. It thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing along the forest floor or in undergrowth. The plant is known for its delicate flowers and is part of the orchid family.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera ruttenii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. The introduction likely occurred through human activity, possibly as an ornamental or for other purposes. It has since become established in certain regions of the country.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited compared to native species.</p>
