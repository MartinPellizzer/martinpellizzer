                    <h1>Asplenium aitonii</h1>
<p>Asplenium aitonii, commonly known as the Aiton's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically clustered in a rosette formation. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf surfaces, adapting to its habitat on rocks or tree bark. It is native to regions in the Middle East and southern Europe, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Asplenium aitonii is often found in crevices or on the trunks of trees, where it forms dense, low-growing colonies.</p>
