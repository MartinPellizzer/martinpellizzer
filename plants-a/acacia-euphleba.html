                    <h1>Acacia euphleba</h1>
<p>Acacia euphleba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acacia, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves that are narrow and feathery in appearance. The plant produces yellow to golden flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and birds. Acacia euphleba is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its wood is sometimes used locally for fuel and minor construction purposes.</p>
