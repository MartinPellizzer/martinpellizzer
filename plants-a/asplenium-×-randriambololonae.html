                    <h1>Asplenium × randriambololonae</h1>
<p>Asplenium × randriambololonae, commonly known as the Madagascar spleenwort, is a hybrid fern native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocks or tree trunks. Its reproductive structures include small, spore-producing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and unique genetic makeup, it is considered a rare and interesting example of hybridization in the fern world.</p>
