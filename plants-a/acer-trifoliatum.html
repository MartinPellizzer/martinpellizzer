                <h1>Acer trifoliatum</h1>
<p>Acer trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically along a central axis. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>Acer trifoliatum typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer trifoliatum has trifoliate leaves that are palmately arranged, with three leaflets each, typically 5â€“10 cm in length, and a bright green color during the growing season.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes furrowed with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer trifoliatum is a species of maple native to eastern Asia, primarily found in China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>Although it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to specific regions within these countries. It thrives in temperate climates, often growing in moist, shaded forests along riverbanks and slopes. This species typically occurs at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Acer trifoliatum is listed as endangered in some areas, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer trifoliatum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by flowering in summer and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues like aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with plants like lavender or marigolds can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer trifoliatum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The tree also acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of nearby vegetation through improved soil conditions. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land during heavy rains.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity of its ecosystem by supporting a wide range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
