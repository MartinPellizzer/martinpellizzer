                    <h1>Afzelia latiflora</h1>
<p>Afzelia latiflora, commonly known as the broad-leaved afzelia, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hard timber, it is valued in the timber industry, though it is also threatened by habitat loss.</p>
