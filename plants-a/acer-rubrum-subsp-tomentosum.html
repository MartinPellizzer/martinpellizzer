                <h1>Acer rubrum subsp. tomentosum</h1>
<p>Acer rubrum subsp.</p>
<p>tomentosum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its showy red foliage in the autumn, which makes it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically opposite, palmately lobed, and have a distinctive reddish tinge even in the summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can grow in a variety of light conditions.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, red flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum subsp.</p>
<p>tomentosum has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a coarsely toothed margin and a dark green upper surface that turns vibrant red in autumn. The stem is slender and often multi-branched, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in pendulous inflorescences, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a paired, winged samara that matures in late summer, dispersing by wind due to the gliding wings.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to moist, well-drained soils, supporting the tree's overall growth and stability.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum subsp.</p>
<p>tomentosum is a subspecies of the red maple native to the eastern United States, primarily found in the Appalachian Mountains. Its native range extends from New York to Georgia and westward to Missouri.</p>
<p>Currently, it is distributed throughout its native habitat and has been introduced in some areas outside its natural range. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in forests, often growing in mixed hardwood stands.</p>
<p>This subspecies is typically found at elevations between 300 and 1,500 meters and is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum subsp.</p>
<p>tomentosum is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant red foliage and ornamental value. It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination.</p>
<p>The growth cycle involves rapid growth in spring and summer, followed by a period of dormancy in winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to remove dead or diseased branches promote healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot, and it pairs well with companion plants like ferns or hostas in shaded gardens.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum subsp.</p>
<p>tomentosum is a valuable component of forest ecosystems, providing food and shelter for a variety of wildlife. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, while its seeds are consumed by birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It acts as a companion plant in mixed hardwood forests, enhancing biodiversity and ecological stability. The plant also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that helps bind soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by supporting the growth of other plants through shade and organic matter accumulation.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum subsp.</p>
<p>tomentosum is a species of maple known for its ornamental value and ecological importance. While not commonly used in culinary applications, it provides habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>In medicinal contexts, its bark and leaves have been traditionally used by Indigenous peoples for their potential anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, it contributes to the forestry sector, supporting timber and paper production.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty, often featured in landscaping and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum subsp.</p>
<p>tomentosum has several popular cultivars such as 'Autumn Flame' and 'Coral Bells', which are prized for their vibrant fall colors and compact growth habits. It also has hybrids with other maple species, including Acer x freemanii, which combine the ornamental qualities of different maples.</p>
<p>These varieties are highly valued in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions. Horticulturalists often use them in landscaping due to their ability to thrive in different soil types and climates. Overall, Acer rubrum subsp.</p>
<p>tomentosum plays a significant role in ornamental horticulture, enhancing the visual diversity of gardens and public spaces.</p>
