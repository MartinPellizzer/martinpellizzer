<p>Asplenium jahandiezii, commonly known as the Persian spleenwort, is a rare and small fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Iran and is characterized by its delicate, evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its fronds are narrow and elongated, with a serrated edge, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorangia.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Asplenium jahandiezii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
