<p>Argyranthemum frutescens subsp.</p>
<p>succulentum, commonly known as the silverleaf arnica, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping.</p>
