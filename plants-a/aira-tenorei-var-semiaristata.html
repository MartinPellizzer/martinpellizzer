                    <h1>Aira tenorei var. semiaristata</h1>
<p>Aira tenorei var. semiaristata, commonly known as the Desert Silvergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, silver-gray leaves with a hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, stabilizing soils in degraded areas.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience in dry climates.</p>
