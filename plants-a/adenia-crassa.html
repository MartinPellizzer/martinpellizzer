                <h1>Adenia crassa</h1>
<p>Adenia crassa, commonly known as the broadleaf adenia, is a climbing shrub native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>Adenia crassa is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in indigenous Australian medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia crassa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, greyish bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. Its flowers are large, showy, and consist of five petals, typically pink to red in color, blooming in spring and attracting birds for pollination. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia crassa is primarily native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions across the archipelago, particularly in the lowland and mountainous areas. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is commonly found in forested regions. It is often associated with rocky or limestone substrates.</p>
<p>Adenia crassa plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia crassa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is primarily found in the North Island, particularly in the lower North Island and parts of the South Island. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It has been reported in several conservation areas where it competes with native species.</p>
<p>Its introduction is believed to have occurred through accidental seed dispersal or human activity.</p>
