                        <h1>Acantholimon acerosum var. parvifolium</h1>
<p>Acantholimon acerosum var. parvifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thrift, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, pink to purplish flowers. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically shorter and narrower than those of the typical variety. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species for rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in coastal and inland desert environments, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range.</p>
