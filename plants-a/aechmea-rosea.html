                <h1>Aechmea rosea</h1>
<p>Aechmea rosea, commonly known as the pink pineapple bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces striking pink to red flower spikes that emerge from the center of the rosette. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, white powdery coating called bloom, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Aechmea rosea thrives in bright, indirect light and is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its vibrant appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea rosea has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, strap-like, and arranged in a compact circle, typically measuring 20–30 cm in length and 5–8 cm in width, with a bluish-gray color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, thick, and often hidden stem with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright from the base. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of purple or pink flowers that bloom during the summer months, and it is primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and hummingbirds. The fruit is a capsule that contains small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>
