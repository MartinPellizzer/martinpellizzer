<p>Aspidium singaporianum, commonly known as the Singapore water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense underwater colonies. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged, contributing to its ornamental appeal in aquatic settings. It plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
