<p>Acampe carinata, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are woody and branched.</p>
<p>Acampe carinata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acampe carinata has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acampe carinata is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
