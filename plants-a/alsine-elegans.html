                    <h1>Alsine elegans</h1>
<p>Alsine elegans, commonly known as slender sandgrass, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, prostrate stems covered with fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its success in disturbed and sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Alsine elegans plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
