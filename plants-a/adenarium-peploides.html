                <h1>Adenarium peploides</h1>
<p>Adenarium peploides, commonly known as the velvet adenium, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. Its ability to store water in its stems makes it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant is also noted for its slow growth and unique, sometimes spiny, foliage structure.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenarium peploides has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenarium peploides is primarily native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the dry deciduous forest and spiny forest habitats of the island. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid regions with well-drained soils. It is commonly distributed in the southern and southwestern parts of Madagascar.</p>
<p>Adenarium peploides is an endemic species, meaning it is not found anywhere else in the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenarium peploides was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and horticulture.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of the United States and Europe. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in urban and agricultural areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread and minimize ecological impacts.</p>
