                    <h1>Ancistrorhynchus constrictus</h1>
<p>Ancistrorhynchus constrictus, commonly known as the pleco or suckermouth catfish, is a freshwater fish native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its laterally compressed body and a distinctive, sucker-like mouth used for grazing on algae. The plant-like appearance of its body has led to its common name, though it is not a true plant. It is often found in slow-moving rivers and streams, where it attaches to surfaces.</p>
<p>This species is popular in aquariums due to its hardy nature and ability to clean tank walls.</p>
