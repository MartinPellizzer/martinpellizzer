                    <h1>Aulomyrcia perforata</h1>
<p>Aulomyrcia perforata, commonly known as the perforate aulomyrcia, is a rare shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with distinctive perforations along the margins, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, shaded environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
