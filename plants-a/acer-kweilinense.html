                <h1>Acer kweilinense</h1>
<p>Acer kweilinense, commonly known as the Kweilin maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red foliage, which turns vibrant shades of orange and red in the fall. The plant has palmately lobed leaves with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer kweilinense has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin and a glossy dark green upper surface that turns red in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its natural habitat in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer kweilinense is a rare tree species native to southern China, specifically found in Guangxi and Guizhou provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in humid, subtropical environments with well-drained soils and partial shade. This species typically grows at altitudes between 800 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, Acer kweilinense is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer kweilinense is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for optimal germination. The growth cycle of Acer kweilinense includes a dormant phase in winter, active growth in spring, and foliage development in summer, followed by leaf drop in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture levels, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and annual pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth. It is relatively pest and disease-resistant but may occasionally face issues like aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like lavender or marigolds can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer kweilinense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, supporting ecosystem health. Its dense foliage acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species in mixed forests. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration, helping to mitigate climate change impacts in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer kweilinense is a species of maple native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to local biodiversity and supports wildlife, though it lacks major commercial uses. Culturally, it is appreciated for its aesthetic appeal in landscaping and garden design.</p>
<p>Its role in traditional Chinese horticulture highlights its symbolic value as a plant of beauty and resilience.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer kweilinense has a range of varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aconitifolium' and 'Variegatum', known for their striking foliage and unique leaf patterns. Hybrids of Acer kweilinense are often created to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and fall color. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden settings.</p>
<p>They are widely cultivated in parks and private gardens for their visual interest throughout the growing season.</p>
