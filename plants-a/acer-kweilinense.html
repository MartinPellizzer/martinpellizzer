                <h1>Acer kweilinense</h1>
<p>Acer kweilinense, commonly known as the Kweilin maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and prefers well-drained soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer kweilinense has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, with a simple structure and wind as the primary pollination method. The fruit is a samara, a winged capsule that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and flat.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer kweilinense is a rare and endangered tree species native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Guizhou and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas, where it grows in humid, subtropical climates. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in forested areas at altitudes ranging from 1,200 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and fragmentation, Acer kweilinense is listed as critically endangered, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts to protect this unique species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer kweilinense is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seed propagation requiring stratification to break dormancy. The growth cycle involves rapid growth in spring and early summer, followed by a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning in late winter helps maintain its shape and remove diseased branches. Common pests include aphids and scale insects, while diseases like powdery mildew may occur in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and improve overall garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer kweilinense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and supporting diverse plant life. Its roots help in erosion control by holding soil in place during heavy rains.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in improving air quality by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer kweilinense is a lesser-known species of maple native to China, primarily found in the Guangxi region.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been traditionally used in Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The wood of Acer kweilinense is relatively soft and is sometimes used in local crafts and small-scale woodworking. Culturally, it holds significance in the regions where it grows, often symbolizing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and lack of commercial cultivation, its economic impact remains minimal, though it contributes to biodiversity and ecological balance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer kweilinense has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aureum' with its striking yellow foliage and 'Variegatum' featuring variegated leaves. Hybrids of Acer kweilinense are often developed to enhance traits such as fall color, growth habit, and disease resistance. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden settings.</p>
<p>They are widely used in landscaping and urban horticulture for their visual impact and resilience.</p>
