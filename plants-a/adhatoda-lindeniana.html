<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its flowers are clustered in inflorescences at the ends of branches.</p>
<p>Adhatoda lindeniana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda lindeniana has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale green to brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white or pale pink petals and a tubular structure, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda lindeniana is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>While it was historically confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including the Caribbean and southern United States, as an ornamental and medicinal plant. It thrives in moist, semi-shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water bodies. This species typically grows at altitudes between 200 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Adhatoda lindeniana is currently listed as vulnerable in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
