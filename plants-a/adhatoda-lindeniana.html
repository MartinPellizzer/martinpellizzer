                <h1>Adhatoda lindeniana</h1>
<p>Adhatoda lindeniana, commonly known as the Indian bellflower, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Adhatoda lindeniana is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda lindeniana has alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually glossy green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white to pale pink petals, and they bloom during the dry season, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and moderately deep, helping the plant anchor in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda lindeniana is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and is often associated with forest understories. It is also present in some parts of Africa, including Nigeria and Kenya.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to regions with a warm climate and well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda lindeniana was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant is now considered a weed in some regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Its rapid spread has led to management efforts to control its distribution.</p>
