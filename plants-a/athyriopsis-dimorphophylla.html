                    <h1>Athyriopsis dimorphophylla</h1>
<p>Athyriopsis dimorphophylla, commonly known as the two-leaf maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has two distinct types of leaves—sterile and fertile—hence its specific epithet "dimorphophylla.". It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
