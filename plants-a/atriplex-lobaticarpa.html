                    <h1>Atriplex lobaticarpa</h1>
<p>Atriplex lobaticarpa, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity.</p>
<p>Atriplex lobaticarpa plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
