                    <h1>Aconitum napellus var. rotundifolium</h1>
<p>Aconitum napellus var. rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaved monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to purple spurred flowers, which are arranged in dense, terminal racemes. The leaves are palmately compound, with rounded lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other Aconitum species and contains potent toxins, making it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potentially dangerous one.</p>
