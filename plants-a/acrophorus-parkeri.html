                <h1>Acrophorus parkeri</h1>
<p>Acrophorus parkeri, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant typically grows to a height of about 2 meters, featuring smooth, greyish bark and oval-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, often greenish-yellow in color, and it produces distinctive, spiny fruits that contain a single seed.</p>
<p>Acrophorus parkeri is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrophorus parkeri has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elongated leaflets that are elliptical in shape, dark green in color, and approximately 5-7 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with five petals, which bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid environment by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus parkeri is primarily native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within the rainforest canopy. It is commonly associated with secondary growth areas and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of specific soil conditions and moisture levels.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus parkeri was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions such as Hawaii, Guam, and parts of French Polynesia.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there through human activities, including accidental transport via maritime trade or intentional cultivation for ornamental or medicinal purposes. The plant has since become established in these areas, thriving in the tropical climate and fertile soils. However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species and alter local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ecological impact, Acrophorus parkeri remains a subject of study for its adaptability and resilience in new environments.</p>
