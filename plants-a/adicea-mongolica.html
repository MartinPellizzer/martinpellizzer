                <h1>Adicea mongolica</h1>
<p>Adicea mongolica, commonly known as the Mongolian bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the steppes of Mongolia and adjacent regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Adicea mongolica is often found in open grasslands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea mongolica has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a pale green color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea mongolica is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, including Mongolia, northern China, and parts of Russia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found in steppes and desert margins. This plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including extreme temperatures and limited water availability. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Adicea mongolica is also occasionally found in neighboring regions such as Kazakhstan and western Siberia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea mongolica was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and waste places.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall and full sun exposure. This plant is commonly found in regions of eastern and central Asia, including parts of China, Mongolia, and Russia. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, particularly through soil disturbance and seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in agricultural and urban environments.</p>
