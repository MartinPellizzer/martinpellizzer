                    <h1>Anthyllis vulneraria var. nana</h1>
<p>Anthyllis vulneraria var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf hairy vetch, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, hairy leaflets, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature.</p>
