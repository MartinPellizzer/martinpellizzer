                <h1>Acianthera villahermosae</h1>
<p>Acianthera villahermosae, commonly known as the Villahermosa violet, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>Acianthera villahermosae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera villahermosae has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white to pale pink petals and a sweet fragrance, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the soil in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera villahermosae is primarily native to Colombia.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the Andean regions of the country, particularly in the departments of Cauca, Nari√±o, and Norte de Santander. It grows in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests and mountainous areas. The plant is known for its attractive, fragrant flowers and is often found in rocky or wooded habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Colombia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera villahermosae was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Texas and Florida, as part of horticultural collections.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along utility corridors. This orchid thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its introduction has led to its establishment in natural areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on native flora.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is considered a non-native species with limited ecological impact in most regions.</p>
