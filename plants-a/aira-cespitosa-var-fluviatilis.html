<p>Aira cespitosa var. fluviatilis, commonly known as river air grass, is a variant of the tufted air grass native to wetland and riparian habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, pale blue to white flowers in dense inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important species in aquatic and wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to fluctuating water levels contributes to its role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting aquatic biodiversity.</p>
