                    <h1>Acnistus ellipticus</h1>
<p>Acnistus ellipticus, commonly known as the creeping nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along its stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are often concealed by the foliage. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, making it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its stinging hairs, similar to those found in true nettles, which can cause skin irritation upon contact.</p>
