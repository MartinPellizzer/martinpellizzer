                <h1>Acnistus ellipticus</h1>
<p>Acnistus ellipticus, commonly known as the creeping nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along its stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are often concealed by the foliage. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, making it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its stinging hairs, similar to those found in true nettles, which can cause skin irritation upon contact.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus ellipticus has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are erect and somewhat woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus ellipticus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Madagascar and the island of Socotra. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along riverbanks. Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic areas, where it thrives in humid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted native range, it is not commonly found outside of these regions in the wild.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus ellipticus was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was originally from tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plant was introduced likely through accidental means, such as being transported with agricultural products or ornamental plants. It thrives in disturbed areas and can spread rapidly, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it poses a significant threat to local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
