<p>Acer saccharinum monumentale, commonly known as the silver maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark and distinctive, pinnately compound leaves that turn bright yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, pendulous clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in parks and gardens.</p>
