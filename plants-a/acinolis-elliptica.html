                <h1>Acinolis elliptica</h1>
<p>Acinolis elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic acinol, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats.</p>
<p>Acinolis elliptica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinolis elliptica has elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length and 2-4 cm in width.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and has a light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinolis elliptica is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Cameroon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland forests and secondary growth areas. The plant thrives in warm, moist climates with well-drained soil. It is often used in traditional medicine for its various therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>Its distribution is also reported in parts of Southeast Asia, though it is most prominently associated with African ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinolis elliptica was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century as an ornamental plant. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is considered a potential weed due to its ability to establish itself in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is primarily in the North Island, with some presence in the South Island.</p>
