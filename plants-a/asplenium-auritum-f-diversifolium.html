                    <h1>Asplenium auritum f. diversifolium</h1>
<p>Asplenium auritum f. diversifolium, commonly known as the Variegated耳蕨, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds.</p>
<p>The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new shoots along their length. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a unique pattern of light and dark green variegation. The fronds are often covered in small, scale-like structures, which help in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
