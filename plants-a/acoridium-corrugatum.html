                <h1>Acoridium corrugatum</h1>
<p>Acoridium corrugatum, commonly known as the wrinkled spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and pond edges. The plant has slender, ribbed stems that bear whorled clusters of small, dark green leaves. Its flowering spikes are usually unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate spikes.</p>
<p>Acoridium corrugatum plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoridium corrugatum has leaves that are narrow, elongated, and linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with a greenish-white color, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist environments and anchoring the plant securely in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium corrugatum is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. This species thrives in cool, humid climates and is often associated with coniferous forests. It is also present in parts of Nevada and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>The plant's distribution is largely limited to these specific ecological niches within the western regions of North America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium corrugatum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides, gardens, and vacant lots. This plant has shown a high degree of adaptability to different soil types and environmental conditions. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production contribute to its successful establishment in non-native regions.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
