                    <h1>Agrostis crinita</h1>
<p>Agrostis crinita, commonly known as silky bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features fine, hair-like leaves that give it a soft, silky appearance, and it typically forms dense, mat-like growths. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
