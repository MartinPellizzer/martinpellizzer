<p>Asplenium griffithianum, commonly known as the Griffith's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that often form a dense, mat-like growth on rocky or shaded soil. The plant typically grows in humid, temperate climates and is often found in forest understories or on damp rock surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which are usually arranged in a distinctive, clustered pattern.</p>
<p>Asplenium griffithianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in shady garden settings.</p>
