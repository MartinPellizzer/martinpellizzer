                    <h1>Allium deserti</h1>
<p>Allium deserti, commonly known as the desert onion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in desert or semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in a loose cluster, which bloom in the spring. Its bulbous base stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Allium deserti is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
