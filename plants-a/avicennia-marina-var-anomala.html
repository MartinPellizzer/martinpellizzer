                    <h1>Avicennia marina var. anomala</h1>
<p>Avicennia marina var. anomala, commonly known as the mangrove shrub, is a halophyte adapted to saline and tidal environments.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which facilitate oxygen uptake in waterlogged soils. The plant exhibits vivipary, where seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. Its leaves are thin and leathery, reducing water loss in high-salinity conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is commonly found in coastal regions of Southeast Asia and contributes to the structure and biodiversity of mangrove ecosystems.</p>
