<p>Andropogon divergens, commonly known as switchgrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features stiff, upright stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Switchgrass is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it a valuable species for ecological restoration.</p>
<p>It is also widely cultivated as a renewable bioenergy crop due to its high biomass yield and low input requirements.</p>
