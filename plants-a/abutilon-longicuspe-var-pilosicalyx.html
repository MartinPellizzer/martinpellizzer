<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and some green algae, characterized by their complex reproductive structures and vascular systems. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their primitive vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that typically have separate male and female flowers and are often found in tropical and temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its order is Malvales, which includes plants with showy flowers and often hairy leaves, such as cotton and hibiscus. Its family is Malvaceae, commonly known as the mallow family, characterized by their five-petaled flowers and often fuzzy or hairy stems. Its genus is Abutilon, a group of flowering plants commonly known as Chinese lanterns, known for their showy, lantern-shaped flowers.</p>
