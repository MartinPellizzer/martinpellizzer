<p>Ajuga devestita, commonly known as barrenwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple during the spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a useful groundcover in shaded garden settings.</p>
