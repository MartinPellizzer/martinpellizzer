                <h1>Actinodaphne litseifolia</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne litseifolia, commonly known as the white sand laurier, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-white in color.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, smooth drupe that matures to a dark color, often used in traditional medicine and as a spice.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne litseifolia has elliptic to ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are typically 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a dense, bushy habit. The small, fragrant flowers are clustered in inflorescences, featuring white to pale yellow petals and stamens, and they bloom during the dry season, likely pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing via birds and mammals that consume the fleshy pulp.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne litseifolia is primarily native to the Indo-Pacific region, including parts of Southeast Asia, the Philippines, and northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical rainforests, often growing in shaded, humid environments. This plant thrives in lowland to hill forest areas, typically in the understorey where it can receive partial sunlight. Its distribution extends across island chains such as Madagascar and the Comoros, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne litseifolia was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil, making it suitable for cultivation in coastal areas and lowland forests. The plant is often found in shaded understory conditions, where it can grow slowly but steadily. Its introduction has sometimes led to its establishment in native ecosystems, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, careful management is recommended to prevent it from becoming a weed in non-native habitats.</p>
