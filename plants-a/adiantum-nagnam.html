                <h1>Adiantum nagnam</h1>
<p>Adiantum nagnam, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive zigzag pattern along the veins.</p>
<p>Adiantum nagnam is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum nagnam has fern-like leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and typically measure 10-20 cm in length, with a delicate, bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and wiry, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, with a structure consisting of separate sepals and stamens, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a cluster of small, dry capsules that release tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum nagnam is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as India, Bangladesh, and parts of Nepal.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest understories, often growing on rocky or wooded areas. This fern thrives in humid tropical and subtropical climates, typically at low to moderate elevations. Its distribution includes regions with high rainfall and well-drained soil conditions.</p>
<p>Adiantum nagnam is a delicate plant that plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum nagnam was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. This plant is often spread through wind-dispersed spores, which allows it to colonize new areas rapidly. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Adiantum nagnam is considered an invasive species in several regions where it has established itself outside its native range.</p>
