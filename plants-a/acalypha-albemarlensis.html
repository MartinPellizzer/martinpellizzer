<p>Acalypha albemarlensis, commonly known as the whiteleaf copperleaf, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its strikingly white, velvety leaves that contrast sharply with its green stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Acalypha albemarlensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental leaves and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha albemarlensis has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly woody with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with bright yellow petals and stamen, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha albemarlensis is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Maré in the Cook Islands.</p>
<p>It is currently only known to exist in a few restricted locations on Maré, primarily in coastal scrub habitats. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is typically found in open, sunny environments. It grows at low altitudes, usually below 10 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acalypha albemarlensis is listed as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha albemarlensis is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant foliage and unique growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most effective method for ensuring genetic consistency. This plant has a fast growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain its shape and encourages bushier growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or mealybugs, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
