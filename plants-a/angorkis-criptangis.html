                    <h1>Angorkis criptangis</h1>
<p>Angorkis criptangis, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a rare and elusive plant native to the dense, shaded understories of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that resemble those of a true fern. The plant thrives in high humidity and low light conditions, often growing on the trunks of ancient trees or on rocky surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically hidden beneath the fronds, contributing to its cryptic name.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Angorkis criptangis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
