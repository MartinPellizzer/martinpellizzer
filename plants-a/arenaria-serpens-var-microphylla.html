                    <h1>Arenaria serpens var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Arenaria serpens var. microphylla, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky regions.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces delicate, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
