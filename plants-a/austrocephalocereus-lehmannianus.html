                    <h1>Austrocephalocereus lehmannianus</h1>
<p>Austrocephalocereus lehmannianus, commonly known as the Lehmann's candelabra cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that branches into a crown of cylindrical stems, giving it a candelabra-like appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom at the ends of the branches, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a dense covering of fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>This cactus is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
