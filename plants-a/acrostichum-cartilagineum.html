                <h1>Acrostichum cartilagineum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum cartilagineum, commonly known as the cartilage fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble cartilage, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or near water bodies. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous layer that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Acrostichum cartilagineum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cartilagineum has elongated, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows horizontally along the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers that bloom in the spring, relying on wind pollination. The fruits are capsules that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively along the ground.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cartilagineum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid environments with abundant water and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems. It is also present in parts of the Caribbean and the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to areas with high rainfall and warm climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cartilagineum was mainly introduced to coastal areas and wetlands where it can thrive in brackish or freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mangrove ecosystems and tidal flats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various species. This plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate saltwater and periodic flooding. Its introduction has been documented in several regions, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>However, its spread can sometimes lead to competition with native species in invaded areas.</p>
