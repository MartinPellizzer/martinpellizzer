<p>Aristida armata, commonly known as the armed grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, Aristida armata is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant.</p>
