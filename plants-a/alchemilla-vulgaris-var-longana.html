                    <h1>Alchemilla vulgaris var. longana</h1>
<p>Alchemilla vulgaris var. longana, commonly known as the long-leaf lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers on slender, upright stems during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its common name reflects its historical use in herbal medicine and its resemblance to the alchemical symbols of transformation.</p>
