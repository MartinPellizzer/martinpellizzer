<p>Acalypha grisebachiana, commonly known as the gray acalypha, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with unique floral structures. The plant is characterized by its soft, gray-green foliage and small, clustered yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha grisebachiana has simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slightly woody, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with greenish-white bracts and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and flat.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha grisebachiana is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar, where it grows in specific tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely restricted to its native range, with limited cultivation in botanical gardens and private collections. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in forest understories or along streambanks. This species is usually found at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural population size, Acalypha grisebachiana is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
