                    <h1>Alectorolophus stenophyllus</h1>
<p>Alectorolophus stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, upright cluster. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Alectorolophus stenophyllus thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of tropical ecosystems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy.</p>
