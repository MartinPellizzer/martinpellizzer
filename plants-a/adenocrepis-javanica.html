<p>Adenocrepis javanica, commonly known as the Javanese thistle, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are linear and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adenocrepis javanica is known for its ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocrepis javanica has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a smooth surface and a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with yellow petals and a tubular structure, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocrepis javanica is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, where it is found in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>It is now also cultivated in other parts of the world, including tropical regions of the Americas and the Caribbean. This species thrives in warm, humid environments, typically in open areas such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is commonly found at low altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat loss, Adenocrepis javanica is considered to be of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenocrepis javanica is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, known for its delicate, fragrant blooms and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, blooming within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry out between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to encourage bushier growth are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>
