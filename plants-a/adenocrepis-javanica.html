                <h1>Adenocrepis javanica</h1>
<p>Adenocrepis javanica, commonly known as the Javanese adenocrepis, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are usually alternate, simple, and have a rough texture.</p>
<p>Adenocrepis javanica is valued for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocrepis javanica has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical and slightly hairy, with a greenish-brown color, and grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocrepis javanica is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Malaysia and the islands of the Indonesian archipelago. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with lowland and coastal areas. Its natural habitat includes forests, shrublands, and disturbed sites where it can establish itself readily.</p>
<p>Adenocrepis javanica is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocrepis javanica was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there accidentally through human activity, such as shipping or gardening. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a significant ecological threat.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread and protect native ecosystems.</p>
