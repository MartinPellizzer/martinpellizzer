<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthorhipsalis monacantha is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans the eastern coast of Brazil. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within the understory of dense tropical forests. It is also known to occur in parts of Paraguay and Argentina.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthorhipsalis monacantha was mainly introduced to regions with warm, dry climates where it can thrive in rocky or coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure, such as parts of southern Africa and the Mediterranean.
