<p>Acanthopanax lasiogyne var. ferrugineus, commonly known as the rusty-leaf dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>The varietal name 'ferrugineus' refers to the rusty-colored hairs present on its stems and leaves.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax lasiogyne var. ferrugineus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as China, India, and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>This variant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical forested areas, often growing in mountainous regions. It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, typically at elevations ranging from 500 to 2000 meters. The plant is part of the Araliaceae family and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely associated with the biodiversity hotspots of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax lasiogyne var. ferrugineus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and human-modified landscapes, such as roadsides, clearings, and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall and well-drained soil conditions. This variant is often found in regions where its parent species, Acanthopanax lasiogyne, has been cultivated or naturally dispersed.
