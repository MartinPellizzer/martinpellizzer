<p>Athyrium melanolepis var. angustifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Japanese shield fern, is a variant of the Japanese shield fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage.</p>
