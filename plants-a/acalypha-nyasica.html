                        <h1>Acalypha nyasica</h1>
<p>Acalypha nyasica, commonly known as the African senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Acalypha nyasica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some African cultures.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha nyasica belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, leaves, and roots. Its class is Equisetopsida, which includes ferns and horsetails, known for their primitive features and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many primitive angiosperms with simple floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a diverse group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, characterized by their milky sap and often showy flowers. Its genus is Acalypha, which includes flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cupplant," often with distinctive, colorful bracts.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha nyasica, a specific plant within the genus Acalypha, native to certain regions of Africa, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha nyasica is primarily native to Malawi, Mozambique, and Tanzania.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories or along stream banks. The species is well adapted to the humid climate and nutrient-rich soils of its native habitat.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha nyasica was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of the United States and Australia. The plant's ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its rapid growth rate contribute to its successful establishment. It is often found in urban and suburban areas where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential varies depending on the local ecosystem and environmental conditions.</p>
