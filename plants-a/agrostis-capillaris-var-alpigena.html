<p>Agrostis capillaris var. alpigena, commonly known as the alpine meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows, rocky slopes, and grasslands at high elevations. The plant has slender,丛生的 stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
