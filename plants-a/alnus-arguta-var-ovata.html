                    <h1>Alnus arguta var. ovata</h1>
<p>Alnus arguta var. ovata, commonly known as the ovate alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to parts of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its ovate, serrated leaves and catkin-like flowers. The plant is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or wetlands. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with Frankia bacteria.</p>
<p>The wood is lightweight and used in various traditional applications, though it is not as commercially significant as other alder species.</p>
