                <h1>Acinos minae</h1>
<p>Acinos minae, commonly known as the Alpine Everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. Its small, dark purple to blue flowers bloom in the summer, adding a splash of color to alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Acinos minae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos minae has small, needle-like leaves that are gray-green in color, arranged in a basal rosette, and measure approximately 5â€“10 millimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is short and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unbranched. Its flowers are small, white to pale pink, clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, and bloom from late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by insects. The plant produces small, dry fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or arid soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos minae is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and gravelly habitats, often growing in open areas with poor soil. This plant is typically associated with mountainous regions and high elevations. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is well adapted to the arid climate of its native range.</p>
<p>Acinos minae is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos minae was mainly introduced to specific regions in Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean area, as part of horticultural and ornamental plant introductions.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and waste areas. The plant has adapted well to these environments, showing resilience to varying climatic conditions. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions, sometimes raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered a non-native species with limited ecological impact in most areas.</p>
