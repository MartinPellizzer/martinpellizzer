                <h1>Adicea longipes</h1>
<p>Adicea longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed adicea, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its elongated stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. Its leaves are ovate and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Adicea longipes is often found in moist, well-drained soils in tropical and subtropical environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea longipes has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with four petals, blooming in late spring, and is pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea longipes is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of South Africa, including the provinces of KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape, and Western Cape.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, wooded areas and along riverbanks. This species thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with forest understories and can be found in both natural and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Adicea longipes is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the diverse ecosystems of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea longipes was mainly introduced to new habitats in the Pacific Islands through human activity, such as unintentional transport via shipping or horticultural trade.</p>
<p>It has established itself in coastal and disturbed areas, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes have led to its colonization of native ecosystems. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete indigenous plant species.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now focusing on monitoring its spread and managing its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
