                <h1>Acianthera montana</h1>
<p>Acianthera montana, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Acianthera montana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera montana has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 3 to 7 cm in length, and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth texture and a light green to reddish-brown color, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and a tubular structure, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera montana is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the eastern regions of Brazil, particularly in the states of Esp√≠rito Santo, Minas Gerais, and Rio de Janeiro. It thrives in humid, tropical rainforest environments. The plant is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of dense forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within this geographic region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera montana was mainly introduced to areas with high humidity and well-drained acidic soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded environments, often growing under the canopy of forests or in rocky crevices. This plant is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador, where its native habitat is preserved. Due to its ornamental value, it has also been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes.</p>
<p>However, its spread outside its native range is limited due to specific environmental requirements.</p>
