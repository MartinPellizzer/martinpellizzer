The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near water bodies or in swampy areas. Its underground corm serves as a storage organ, allowing it to survive periods of drought.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its rapid growth and ability to regenerate from its corm after being cut or damaged.</p>
