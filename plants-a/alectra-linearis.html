                    <h1>Alectra linearis</h1>
<p>Alectra linearis, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, green, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit and produces tiny, white flowers. The plant possesses specialized bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. It thrives in wetlands and shallow waters, where it can float or anchor itself to submerged surfaces.</p>
<p>Alectra linearis plays a unique role in its ecosystem by contributing to nutrient cycling through its predatory behavior.</p>
