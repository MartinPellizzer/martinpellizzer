                        <h1>Abutilon esquirolii</h1>
<p>Abutilon esquirolii, commonly known as the Mexican velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The leaves are palmately lobed, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in gardens.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon esquirolii is primarily native to the island of Socotra, which is located in the Arabian Sea off the coast of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>This unique plant is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of Socotra, where it thrives in rocky and coastal habitats. It is a rare and endemic species, adapted to the specific environmental conditions of its native range. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a valuable component of Socotra's unique flora.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this plant from threats such as habitat loss and over-collection.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon esquirolii was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the late 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant has since become naturalized and is now found in various disturbed habitats across the archipelago. It is considered a non-native species that has established itself in the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native flora and fauna remains minimal compared to other invasive species in the region.</p>
