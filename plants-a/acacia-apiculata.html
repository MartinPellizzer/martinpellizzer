                        <h1>Acacia apiculata</h1>
<p>Acacia apiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are arranged in cylindrical clusters. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight hairy texture.</p>
<p>Acacia apiculata is well adapted to dry and rocky environments, making it a hardy and resilient species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia apiculata is primarily native to northern Australia, including the Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. This species is often associated with mulga woodlands and spinifex grasslands. It thrives in regions with low rainfall and is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of the Australian outback.</p>
<p>Acacia apiculata is an important component of the local flora and provides habitat and food for various native animals.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia apiculata was mainly introduced to South Australia for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it establishes quickly. The plant has also been introduced to parts of New South Wales and Queensland, where it has become naturalized in some areas. Due to its rapid growth and spread, it is considered a potential weed in certain regions.</p>
<p>However, it is generally not considered highly invasive and is often used in revegetation projects.</p>
