<p>Axonopus attenuatus, commonly known as slender axonopus, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 mm wide, with a soft, bluish-green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are clustered along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, pastures, and along waterways.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
