<p>Arthrophytum regelii, commonly known as the desert cushion, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage that forms a compact, rounded shape, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the growing season, typically in spring or early summer. Its thick, fleshy stems and leaves store moisture, allowing it to survive prolonged droughts.</p>
<p>Arthrophytum regelii is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in its natural habitat.</p>
