<p>Abrus grandiflorus, commonly known as the Indian bead tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and striking red, bean-like seeds that are often used as ornamental objects. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds contain toxic compounds, making them unsuitable for consumption.</p>
<p>The tree is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and cultural significance in traditional practices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abrus grandiflorus has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as an upright shrub or small tree. The flowers are showy, clustered in umbels, with five pinkish-white petals and a prominent yellowish stamen, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a flat, bean-like pod that splits open to release seeds with long, silky hairs, dispersing them by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrus grandiflorus is a climbing legume native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands, likely due to human introduction. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, typically in moist forests or along riverbanks. It grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its habitat is threatened by deforestation and land conversion, leading to concerns about its long-term survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abrus grandiflorus is a striking flowering plant known for its vibrant red and white blooms.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification to enhance germination. The growth cycle of this plant includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by blooming in summer and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent watering, especially during the growing season. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing months and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its health and shape. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while fungal diseases can occur in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and improve the plant's overall health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Abrus grandiflorus is a flowering plant that provides nectar and seeds, serving as a food source for various wildlife and birds.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The plant acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing soil fertility and supporting biodiversity. Its deep roots help in erosion control by stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers shelter and habitat for small animals, playing a vital role in maintaining ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Abrus grandiflorus is a flowering plant native to tropical regions, known for its ornamental value and various practical applications.</p>
