                    <h1>Artemisia desertorum var. douglasiana</h1>
<p>Artemisia desertorum var. douglasiana, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and aromatic properties, it plays a role in both ecological and traditional uses.</p>
