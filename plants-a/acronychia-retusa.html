                <h1>Acronychia retusa</h1>
<p>Acronychia retusa, commonly known as the smooth acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to northern Australia and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are spherical and covered in a sticky, resinous substance.</p>
<p>Acronychia retusa is often found in dry, coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia retusa has elliptical to ovate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are typically 5â€“15 cm in length and have a smooth margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels off in strips, and it grows upright with a spreading crown. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, with five petals and stamens, and they bloom in clusters during the wet season, likely pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in rocky or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia retusa is primarily native to northern Australia, including the Northern Territory, Western Australia, and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rainforest and coastal areas, particularly in the wet tropics. The plant thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often associated with riverine and coastal rainforests. It is also present in parts of New Guinea and the island of Timor.</p>
<p>Acronychia retusa is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, known for its distinctive foliage and ecological importance in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia retusa was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of eastern Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils and moist environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the northern and eastern parts of New South Wales and Queensland. This plant is often associated with coastal heathlands and lowland rainforests. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in some areas, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes.</p>
