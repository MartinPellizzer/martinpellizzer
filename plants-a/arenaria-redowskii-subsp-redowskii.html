<p>Arenaria redowskii subsp.</p>
<p>redowskii, commonly known as the Redowski's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it has a compact growth habit to withstand strong winds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
