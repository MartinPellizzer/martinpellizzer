                    <h1>Alopecurus aequalis f. natans</h1>
<p>Alopecurus aequalis f. natans, commonly known as floating foxtail, is a variant of the annual grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique growth habit, where the stems and leaves float on the surface of water, often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is an aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in moist environments such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native regions.</p>
