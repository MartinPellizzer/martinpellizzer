                <h1>Acrostichum denticulatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum denticulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Davalliaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and finely toothed. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater sources. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common sight in wetlands and mangrove forests.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum denticulatum has leaves that are elongated, sword-shaped, and have a serrated edge, arranged in a pinnate pattern along the stem, with a dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat fibrous, with a rough, bark-like surface that is typically light green to brown in color. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are greenish-white in color and bloom during the late spring to early summer, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind once it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum denticulatum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, lowland areas such as swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid environments with high rainfall and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems. It is particularly common in regions of Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to coastal and estuarine habitats where it plays an important ecological role.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum denticulatum was mainly introduced to coastal and wetland areas in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found along the edges of marshes and tidal flats. This plant is commonly used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and reduce erosion. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it a valuable but sometimes invasive species in these habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent it from outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
