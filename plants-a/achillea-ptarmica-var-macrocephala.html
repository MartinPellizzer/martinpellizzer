<p>It features sturdy, upright stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant has finely divided, silvery-green leaves that are aromatic when crushed. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its historical use in herbal medicine and as a symbol of love and devotion adds to its cultural significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea ptarmica var. macrocephala has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, with a bluish-gray color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age, and it grows in a clumping pattern. The flowers are large, flat-topped composite heads composed of numerous yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, enabling the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
