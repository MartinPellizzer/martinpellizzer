                    <h1>Astragalus tatsienensis var. incanus</h1>
<p>Astragalus tatsienensis var. incanus, commonly known as the Tibetan milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces cylindrical, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in high-altitude, arid environments and is adapted to withstand cold and low-nutrient soils.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in alpine ecosystems.</p>
