<p>Arthrothamnus, commonly known as the spiny tamarisk, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their succulent, often spiny stems and leaves. They are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. Arthrothamnus species are adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems and water-storing tissues.</p>
<p>Their small, often pink or red flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting pollinators in dry climates.</p>
