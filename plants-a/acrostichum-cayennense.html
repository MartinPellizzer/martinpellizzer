<p>Acrostichum cayennense, commonly known as the Cayenne broadleaf or Cayenne fern, is a tropical fern native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>

The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its hardiness in wet conditions.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically dark green with a waxy texture, making it a striking ornamental plant in tropical gardens.</p>
