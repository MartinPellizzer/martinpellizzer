                <h1>Acrostichum cayennense</h1>
<p>Acrostichum cayennense, commonly known as the Cayenne broadleaf or Cayenne fern, is a tropical fern native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its hardiness in wet conditions.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically dark green with a waxy texture, making it a striking ornamental plant in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cayennense has large, pinnately compound leaves that are elongated and dark green, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and somewhat fibrous, with a light brown bark that has a rough, fissured texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the rainy season and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are lightweight and adapted for aerial transport.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in wet, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cayennense is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of rivers in these areas. This plant thrives in humid, swampy environments and is often associated with disturbed or flooded soils. It is also present in parts of Central America, including Panama and Costa Rica.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes be found in introduced habitats outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cayennense was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or wetland habitats. This plant is commonly associated with mangrove ecosystems and can tolerate brackish water conditions. Its introduction has been linked to human activities such as coastal development and landfills.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
