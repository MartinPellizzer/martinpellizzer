                    <h1>Acacia oxyosprion</h1>
<p>Acacia oxyosprion, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in dense clusters. The plant has bipinnate leaves composed of numerous tiny leaflets, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces flat, bean-like pods that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Acacia oxyosprion is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
