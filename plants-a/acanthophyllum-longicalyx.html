<p>Acanthophyllum longicalyx, commonly known as the long-fruited spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with distinctive, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its adaptations include thick, fleshy stems that store water and a deep root system for accessing groundwater.</p>
<p>Acanthophyllum longicalyx plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
