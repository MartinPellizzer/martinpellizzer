                        <h1>Abarema nediana</h1>
<p>Abarema nediana, commonly known as the pink stinkwood, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is known for its aromatic, often fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abarema nediana is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is found in the states of Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo. This species thrives in the humid, tropical climate of the coastal areas within this biome. It is commonly found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Abarema nediana is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abarema nediana was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it can thrive in full sun. The plant is known for its ability to colonize disturbed areas quickly, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its introduction has led to competition with native flora, affecting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>It is often spread through seed dispersal by wind, water, or human activity.</p>
