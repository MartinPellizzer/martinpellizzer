                    <h1>Agropyron subalpinum</h1>
<p>Agropyron subalpinum, commonly known as alpine wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in harsh alpine environments, tolerating cold temperatures and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Agropyron subalpinum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
