                    <h1>Atriplex pungens</h1>
<p>Atriplex pungens, commonly known as the sharpleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of salt crystals, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is adapted to saline soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Atriplex pungens plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
