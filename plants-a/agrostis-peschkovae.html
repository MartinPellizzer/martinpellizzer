                    <h1>Agrostis peschkovae</h1>
<p>Agrostis peschkovae, commonly known as Peschkov's bentgrass, is a rare grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Agrostis peschkovae is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
