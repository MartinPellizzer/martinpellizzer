<p>Aichryson pachycaulon subsp.</p>
<p>pachycaulon, commonly known as the thick-stemmed aichryson, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are typically small and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
