                    <h1>Ancylogyne capitata</h1>
<p>Ancylogyne capitata, commonly known as the clustered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with a distinctive rosette of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense, globular inflorescence at the center of the rosette. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, adapting to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Ancylogyne capitata is often found in sandy soils and is an important component of local flora in its native habitat.</p>
