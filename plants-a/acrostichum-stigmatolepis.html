                <h1>Acrostichum stigmatolepis</h1>
<p>Acrostichum stigmatolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it can reach heights of up to 1 meter.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum stigmatolepis has large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath, with a broad, feather-like shape and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender, slightly woody, and has a rough, greyish bark. The plant produces inconspicuous, small greenish flowers that bloom in early spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant in wet, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum stigmatolepis is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and high rainfall. This species is commonly found in coastal and swampy habitats, often growing near mangrove forests. It plays an important ecological role in these environments by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum stigmatolepis was mainly introduced to areas with high humidity and disturbed soils, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly associated with wetland environments and can thrive in marshy or swampy habitats. This plant is typically found in regions with consistent rainfall and warm temperatures. Its introduction has been linked to human activities such as land development and the alteration of natural water systems.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
