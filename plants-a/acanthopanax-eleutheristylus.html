                <h1>Acanthopanax eleutheristylus</h1>
<p>Acanthopanax eleutheristylus, commonly known as the Chinese angelica tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically red or yellow when mature. It is often found in forested areas and can grow up to several meters in height.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both traditional medicine and ecological studies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax eleutheristylus has compound, alternate leaves that are pinnately arranged, with ovate to elliptical leaflets that are typically 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, having a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is grayish-brown in color, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a straight, upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a red, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, dispersed primarily by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax eleutheristylus is a rare shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, specifically in the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas, largely due to habitat fragmentation. It thrives in temperate forests with high humidity and well-drained soil, often found in mixed evergreen-deciduous forests. This species typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat loss, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax eleutheristylus is a hardy shrub known for its adaptability and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, thriving in temperate climates and reaching maturity within a few years.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with organic insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with aromatic herbs like mint or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's biodiversity.</p>
