                <h1>Adicea nudicaulis</h1>
<p>Adicea nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stemmed adicea, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. The plant features simple, linear leaves that are often hairless, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and appear in clusters.</p>
<p>Adicea nudicaulis is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea nudicaulis has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth green surface and a slightly waxy texture, typically measuring 2-5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a pale green color and a somewhat hairy texture, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea nudicaulis is primarily native to South America, specifically found in countries such as Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest region, where it adapts well to the humid and tropical climate. It is also present in parts of Central America, including Belize and Honduras.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species within its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea nudicaulis was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has established itself in various regions outside its native range, often in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant's ability to thrive in diverse conditions contributes to its successful distribution. It is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its spread highlights the ecological impacts of introducing non-native species to new ecosystems.</p>
