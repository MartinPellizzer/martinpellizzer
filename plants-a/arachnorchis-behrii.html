                    <h1>Arachnorchis behrii</h1>
<p>Arachnorchis behrii, commonly known as the Behri's spider orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Australia, particularly in Western Australia and South Australia. The plant produces delicate, spider-like flowers with a unique coloration of pale green and white, often with a contrasting red or purple lip. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and requires a cool, moist environment to bloom.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
