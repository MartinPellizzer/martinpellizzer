<p>Actinodaphne macgregorii, commonly known as the MacGregor's camphor tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and have a glossy surface. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually greenish-white in color and are arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its aromatic wood and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne macgregorii has simple, lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as an erect shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in panicles, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, rounded drupe that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant in its tropical habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne macgregorii is a rare tropical plant native to the island of Borneo, specifically found in the Malaysian state of Sarawak.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few remote areas within the lowland rainforests of the region. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil, typically growing near streams or in forest understories. The plant is found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is classified as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts to prevent its extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne macgregorii is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. The plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, thriving in warm, humid climates with indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants like hibiscus or ferns can enhance its growth and aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne macgregorii is a tropical evergreen tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its fragrant flowers attract pollinators such as bees and birds, which help in the reproduction of the plant. The dense foliage acts as a companion plant, supporting biodiversity in the understory of tropical forests. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>
