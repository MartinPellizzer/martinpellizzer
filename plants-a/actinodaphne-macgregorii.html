                <h1>Actinodaphne macgregorii</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne macgregorii, commonly known as the MacGregor's camphor tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China and is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed, typical of the Lauraceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for traditional uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne macgregorii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 10 to 20 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that has a slight rough texture, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white in color, with a fragrant scent, and bloom during the wet season; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, ovoid berry that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne macgregorii is primarily native to the Philippines and the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical regions of these areas, where it thrives in humid and warm climates. It is commonly associated with lowland and hill forest environments. The plant's natural range is limited to these specific island groups in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the unique ecological conditions of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne macgregorii was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and montane forests, often growing in the understory where it receives partial shade. This plant is valued for its aromatic leaves and potential medicinal properties, which have contributed to its introduction in horticultural and traditional medicine contexts. Its distribution has expanded due to human activity, including cultivation for ornamental and commercial purposes.</p>
<p>However, it remains primarily native to Southeast Asia, with limited natural spread outside its original range.</p>
