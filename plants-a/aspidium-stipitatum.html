                    <h1>Aspidium stipitatum</h1>
<p>Aspidium stipitatum, commonly known as the spurred brake, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Aspidium stipitatum is often found growing on rocks or in woodland areas, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small organisms.</p>
