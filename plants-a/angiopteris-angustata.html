                    <h1>Angiopteris angustata</h1>
<p>Angiopteris angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marattiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself to submerged substrates. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Angiopteris angustata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
