<p>Adiantopsis ternata, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of the more well-known maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantopsis ternata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
