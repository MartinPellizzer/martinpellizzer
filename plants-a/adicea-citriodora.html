                <h1>Adicea citriodora</h1>
<p>Adicea citriodora, commonly known as the lemon-scented or lemon tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of Africa and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its fragrant, narrow leaves that emit a strong lemon-like aroma. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by oval, yellow fruits with a thin, leathery skin. The leaves and fruits are often used in traditional medicine for their aromatic and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and unique fragrance make it a popular choice for both horticultural and therapeutic applications.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea citriodora has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are glossy green on top and pale underneath, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in axillary inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea citriodora is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical regions with high humidity and warm climates. This plant typically grows in lowland areas, often near water sources such as rivers and wetlands. It is adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils and is often part of the undergrowth in rainforests.</p>
<p>Its native distribution includes parts of the Pacific Islands as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea citriodora was mainly introduced to control insect pests, particularly the citrus psyllid, in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>It is commonly used as a biological control agent due to its ability to feed on the nymphs of these pests. The plant is native to South America but has been introduced to various regions where citrus cultivation is prevalent. Its introduction has helped reduce the need for chemical pesticides in some areas.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts.</p>
