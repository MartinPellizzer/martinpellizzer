                        <h1>Acacia wickhamii subsp. viscidula</h1>
<p>Acacia wickhamii subsp.</p>
<p>viscidula, commonly known as the sticky acacia, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and small, yellow globular flowers that appear in spring.</p>
<p>The leaves are phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that perform the function of true leaves. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain seeds, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in coastal and inland regions with sandy or gravelly soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia wickhamii subsp.</p>
<p>viscidula is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Western Australia. It is found in the Pilbara and Goldfields regions, where it thrives in sandy soils and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low rainfall. It is commonly found in open woodlands and along rocky drainage lines.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within the northern parts of the state.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia wickhamii subsp.</p>
<p>viscidula was mainly introduced to South Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the lower Murray region.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to dry conditions and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It is often used for stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
<p>Its introduction has had a significant impact on local ecosystems due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
