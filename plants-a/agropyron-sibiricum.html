<p>Agropyron sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including sandy soils and arctic tundras.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is often used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop.</p>
