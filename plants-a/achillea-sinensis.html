                <h1>Achillea sinensis</h1>
<p>Achillea sinensis, commonly known as Chinese yarrow, is a flowering plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea sinensis has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a grayish-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a greenish-brown bark, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are flat-topped umbels composed of small, white to pale yellow ray florets, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene, dispersed by wind due to its lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sinensis is primarily native to China, particularly in the regions of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Tibet.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in mountainous regions and meadows at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. It is part of the Asteraceae family and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely associated with the ecological conditions of these specific geographic areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sinensis was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas across the country, particularly in the western and southern regions. The plant is often used in drought-tolerant gardens because of its ability to thrive in well-drained soils. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in certain regions where it spreads beyond cultivated areas.</p>
