                    <h1>Agatophyton</h1>
<p>Agatophyton, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of small, primitive vascular plants that belong to the order Lepidoziidales.</p>
<p>These plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments and are characterized by their spore-bearing structures called strobila. Agatophyton species have a distinct life cycle involving both a gametophyte and a sporophyte stage. Their leaves are usually scale-like and arranged in whorls around the stem.</p>
<p>Despite their ancient lineage, some species of Agatophyton are still found in temperate and tropical regions today.</p>
