                    <h1>Artemisia humilis</h1>
<p>Artemisia humilis, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine, glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
<p>The essential oils from its leaves have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their aromatic and antimicrobial properties.</p>
