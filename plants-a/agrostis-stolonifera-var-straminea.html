                    <h1>Agrostis stolonifera var. straminea</h1>
<p>Agrostis stolonifera var. straminea, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. The plant is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively through runners. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control.</p>
