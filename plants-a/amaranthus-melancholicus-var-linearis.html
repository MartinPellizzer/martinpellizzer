<p>Amaranthus melancholicus var. linearis, commonly known as the slender amaranth, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and upright growth habit, often reaching heights of 1 to 3 feet. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which later develop into bristly, spiny seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
