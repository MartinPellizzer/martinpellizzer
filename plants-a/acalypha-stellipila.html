                <h1>Acalypha stellipila</h1>
<p>Acalypha stellipila, commonly known as the star-leaf or star-leaved spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Acalypha stellipila is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha stellipila has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark, growing upright with a somewhat branching pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green with a distinctive star-like appearance, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after ripening.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha stellipila is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, primarily found in countries such as Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.</p>
<p>It currently has a restricted distribution, with populations mostly confined to specific forested areas in these regions. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in lowland and montane evergreen forests. It is generally found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited research, its conservation status is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for further conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha stellipila is a tropical plant known for its vibrant, star-shaped leaves and ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for quick growth. This fast-growing plant thrives in warm climates and has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acalypha stellipila is a flowering plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its showy, star-shaped flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local pollination network. It also acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a healthy ecosystem. The plant's extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving soil quality and supporting a wide range of insect life.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
