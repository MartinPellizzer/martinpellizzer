                    <h1>Agropyron subulatiforme</h1>
<p>Agropyron subulatiforme, commonly known as the slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold, arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is often found in alpine and steppe habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded grassland areas.</p>
