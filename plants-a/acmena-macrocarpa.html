                <h1>Acmena macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Acmena macrocarpa, commonly known as the satinash tree, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters, followed by edible, spherical fruits that are typically red or orange when mature. The bark is smooth and pale grey, often exfoliating to reveal a lighter inner layer.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena macrocarpa has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth, glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement, ranging from 5 to 12 centimeters in length, and have a slightly waxy texture. The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, light grey bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a woody capsule containing small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light, fluffy appendages.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena macrocarpa is primarily native to eastern and northeastern Australia, including regions such as Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in subtropical and temperate rainforests, as well as along riverine areas and coastal regions. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with dense, shaded environments. It is an evergreen shrub or small tree that plays an important role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Acmena macrocarpa is also known by the common name "broad-leafed satinash" and is valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena macrocarpa was mainly introduced to Australia as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales. The plant is commonly found in urban and suburban areas, often growing along roadsides and in disturbed soils. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, efforts are being made to monitor its spread and manage its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
