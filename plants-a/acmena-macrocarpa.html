                <h1>Acmena macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Acmena macrocarpa, commonly known as the satinash tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rutaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by spherical, red berries. These berries are edible and often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Acmena macrocarpa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena macrocarpa has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“12 cm in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena macrocarpa is a species native to eastern Australia, particularly found in New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>While it was originally restricted to its native range, it has been widely cultivated and introduced to other regions, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It thrives in a variety of environments, including coastal areas, forests, and rocky slopes, often growing in well-drained soils. This plant typically occurs at altitudes ranging from sea level up to 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, it is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status due to its adaptability and widespread cultivation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmena macrocarpa is a fast-growing, evergreen shrub known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-hardwood cuttings or seed, with cuttings being the most reliable method. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few years, making it ideal for quick landscape fill.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, but it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and pruning to shape the plant and promote air circulation are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract scale insects or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering plants can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support beneficial insect activity.</p>
