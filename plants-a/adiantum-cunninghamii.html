                <h1>Adiantum cunninghamii</h1>
<p>Adiantum cunninghamii, commonly known as the mountain maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bi-lobed fronds that give it a lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive rachis that is slightly hairy.</p>
<p>Adiantum cunninghamii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum cunninghamii has fern-like leaves that are bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem, and typically measure around 20â€“30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a finely divided structure. The plant has a slender, upright stem that is covered in a smooth, light green to grayish-brown bark, growing in a clumping pattern.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, emerging in late spring to early summer. The fruit is a cluster of sporangia that release spores, and the plant relies on wind for seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and anchor it to moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum cunninghamii is primarily native to the Chatham Islands, Kermadec Islands, New Zealand North, and New Zealand South.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. It thrives in the temperate climate of these regions, often growing on cliffs or in coastal areas. The plant is well adapted to the humid and often windy conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat for various invertebrates and small organisms.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum cunninghamii was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas with moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Appalachian region, where it thrives in rocky crevices and along stream banks. This plant has been established in several states including Georgia, Tennessee, and North Carolina. Its introduction is likely due to natural dispersal through wind or water, as well as human activity.</p>
<p>It is considered a non-native species in these regions, though it has become well integrated into the local flora.</p>
