                        <h1>Acacia aneura var. microcarpa</h1>
<p>Acacia aneura var. microcarpa, commonly known as the ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and pale grey bark that resembles the ghostly appearance of its common name. The leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, narrow leaflets that are arranged in a feathery pattern. It produces yellow globular flowers that appear in late winter to early spring, followed by flat, leathery pods that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and a slow growth rate.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia aneura var. microcarpa is primarily native to the arid regions of central Australia, including parts of South Australia, Northern Territory, and Western Australia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in desert and semi-desert environments. This variety is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the inland areas, where it often grows as a shrub or small tree. It is a key component of the vegetation in the Simpson Desert and surrounding regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with the presence of water sources such as ephemeral streams and waterholes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia aneura var. microcarpa was mainly introduced to South Australia and parts of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, growing on rocky soils and sand plains. This variety is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber due to its hardy nature. It has also been introduced to some areas of New South Wales and Queensland for land rehabilitation projects.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by its preference for specific environmental conditions.</p>
