<p>Ampelopsis virginiana, commonly known as Virginia creeper, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves that typically have five leaflets, which turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland areas, along stream banks, and in disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
