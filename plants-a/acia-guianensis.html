                <h1>Acia guianensis</h1>
<p>Acia guianensis, commonly known as Guianese acacia, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly found in Guyana and parts of the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and long, straight branches that make it suitable for ornamental and timber purposes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests.</p>
<p>Acia guianensis is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acia guianensis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, light gray bark that exudes a mild aromatic scent. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and have yellow petals with a distinct red center, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
