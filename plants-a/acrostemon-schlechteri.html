<p>Acrostemon schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's ginger, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other gingers and related plants. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in moisture retention. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive, narrow bract that protects the inflorescence.</p>
<p>Acrostemon schlechteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, humid climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostemon schlechteri has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown color, growing upright and branching profusely. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, white to pale pink petals, blooming in summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<p>Acrostemon schlechteri is primarily native to the southern regions of India, particularly in the states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Sri Lanka and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. It is often associated with tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific geographic areas within South Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostemon schlechteri was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its showy, fragrant flowers. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, sometimes as an ornamental or for horticultural purposes.</p>
