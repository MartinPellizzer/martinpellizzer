                <h1>Acronychia ovalifolia</h1>
<p>Acronychia ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits.</p>
<p>Acronychia ovalifolia is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its durable wood, which is used in traditional crafts and construction.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia ovalifolia has elliptical or oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is typically woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is gray to brown in color, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in dense inflorescences, and they bloom during the wet season, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release smooth, oval seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and helping it withstand periods of drought.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia ovalifolia is primarily native to northeastern Australia, including Queensland and northern New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland rainforests. This species thrives in humid, subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with rocky outcrops and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>The plant is an important component of the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia ovalifolia was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal and lowland areas where it can receive ample sunlight. This plant is commonly found in parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique leaf shape.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential invasiveness in non-native environments.</p>
