                    <h1>Acilepis pseudosutepensis</h1>
<p>Acilepis pseudosutepensis, commonly known as the Andean cholla, is a spiny, shrub-like cactus native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It features a thick, cylindrical stem covered in sharp, needle-like spines, which protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a splash of color to its arid environment. It is adapted to survive in cold, dry conditions with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat.</p>
