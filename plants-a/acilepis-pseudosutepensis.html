                <h1>Acilepis pseudosutepensis</h1>
<p>Acilepis pseudosutepensis, commonly known as the Andean cholla, is a spiny, shrub-like cactus native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It features a thick, cylindrical stem covered in sharp, needle-like spines, which protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a splash of color to its arid environment. It is adapted to survive in cold, dry conditions with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis pseudosutepensis has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly pubescent surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the arid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis pseudosutepensis is primarily native to Thailand.</p>
<p>This species is found in specific regions within the country, particularly in areas with suitable tropical or subtropical climates. It is commonly associated with forested or semi-deciduous habitats. The plant is adapted to the local environmental conditions of Thailand, including its climate and soil types.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific ecological zones within Thailand.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis pseudosutepensis was mainly introduced to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It is primarily found in the high-altitude areas of Peru and Bolivia. This species is typically associated with rocky and arid environments. Its introduction is believed to be due to human activity, such as horticultural practices or accidental transport.</p>
<p>However, its natural distribution remains limited and poorly documented.</p>
