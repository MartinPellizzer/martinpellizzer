                <h1>Acroptilon repens</h1>
<p>Acroptilon repens, commonly known as western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairless stems that often lie flat on the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration.</p>
<p>Acroptilon repens is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in prairie and steppe environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acroptilon repens has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 6 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Its stems are creeping and sprawling, with a greenish color and a slightly hairy texture, often forming a dense mat on the ground. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in loose panicles, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroptilon repens is primarily native to temperate regions of Eurasia, including Europe, Asia, and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. This plant thrives in regions with moderate climates and is often associated with arid or semi-arid environments. It is particularly common in the Mediterranean Basin and the steppes of Central Asia.</p>
<p>Its distribution extends into North America, where it has been introduced and sometimes becomes invasive.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroptilon repens was mainly introduced to control erosion and as a forage crop in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils, roadsides, and agricultural fields. This plant has become invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution is widespread in North America, particularly in the western United States.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a noxious weed in several states due to its aggressive spread and negative impact on native plant communities.</p>
