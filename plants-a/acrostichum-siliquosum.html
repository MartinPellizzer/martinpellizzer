                <h1>Acrostichum siliquosum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum siliquosum, commonly known as the common swamp fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, compound leaves that are typically divided into numerous narrow segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures are concealed within spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are typically found on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum siliquosum plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of wetland habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum siliquosum has large, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows in a branching pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in wet, swampy environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum siliquosum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist lowland areas, including riverbanks, wetlands, and swampy forests. This plant thrives in humid climates with rich, organic soil and abundant sunlight. It is often associated with disturbed or secondary growth habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes countries such as Brazil, Peru, and Colombia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum siliquosum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetlands, swamps, and along riverbanks where it can access abundant water. This plant is often found in disturbed habitats, such as areas with recent flooding or human activity. Its introduction has been documented in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
