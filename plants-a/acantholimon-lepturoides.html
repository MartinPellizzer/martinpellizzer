                        <h1>Acantholimon lepturoides</h1>
<p>Acantholimon lepturoides, commonly known as the slender saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial species characterized by its low-growing habit and fleshy, often succulent stems. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Acantholimon lepturoides is adapted to rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
