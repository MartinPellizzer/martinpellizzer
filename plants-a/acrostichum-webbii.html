                <h1>Acrostichum webbii</h1>
<p>Acrostichum webbii, commonly known as the broadleaf hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, broad leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Acrostichum webbii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum webbii has large, elongated, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and upright, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that exhibits a slight ridged texture. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months, and they are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in moist soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum webbii is primarily native to Southeast Asia, specifically regions including Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid tropical environments, often found in coastal areas and mangrove swamps. This plant is commonly associated with brackish or saltwater habitats, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems. It is also found in parts of the Pacific Islands, such as Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely linked to areas with high rainfall and warm climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum webbii was mainly introduced to urban and disturbed areas, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found along riverbanks and in wetlands. This plant is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It has been reported in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Its introduction is often associated with human activity, such as landscaping and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
