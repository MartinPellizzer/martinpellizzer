                    <h1>Aconitum tokii</h1>
<p>Aconitum tokii, commonly known as Japanese aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes at the top of the stem. Its roots are highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids, making it a dangerous plant to handle.</p>
<p>Aconitum tokii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in woodland areas.</p>
