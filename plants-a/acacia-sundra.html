                        <h1>Acacia sundra</h1>
<p>Acacia sundra, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Acacia sundra is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along coastal areas.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia sundra is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils, often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. This species is commonly associated with coastal and riverine ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife. Acacia sundra is also found in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to areas with a warm, wet climate and minimal frost.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia sundra was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils and sufficient sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, clearings, and degraded forests. The plant has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a potential invasive species in some ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its use in agroforestry and soil stabilization.</p>
