                    <h1>Antennaria monocephala var. latisquamea</h1>
<p>Antennaria monocephala var. latisquamea, commonly known as the broad-scale sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, typically on slender stems. The plant has finely divided, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh, low-nutrient conditions.</p>
