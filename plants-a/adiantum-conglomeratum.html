                    <h1>Adiantum conglomeratum</h1>
<p>Adiantum conglomeratum, commonly known as the clustered maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, humus-rich soil. Its rhizomes are short and produce numerous small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum conglomeratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
