                <h1>Adinandra stenosepala</h1>
<p>Adinandra stenosepala, commonly known as the narrow-sepaled adinandra, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers with four to five sepals. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra stenosepala has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, pale brown bark that remains relatively uniform in texture throughout the plant's growth. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra stenosepala is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in shaded understory conditions. This species is also present in parts of northeastern India and the Andaman Islands. It thrives in humid environments with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Adinandra stenosepala is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in the ecological balance of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra stenosepala was mainly introduced to areas with suitable tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high rainfall and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It thrives in secondary forests and disturbed habitats, often spreading through seed dispersal by animals and wind. This plant is commonly found in Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activities such as cultivation and accidental transport.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native environments.</p>
