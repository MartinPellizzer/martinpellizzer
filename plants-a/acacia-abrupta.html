                    <h1>Acacia abrupta</h1>
<p>Acacia abrupta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white to greyish powder, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Acacia abrupta is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various native animals and insects.</p>
