                <h1>Achyrospermum mearnsii</h1>
<p>Achyrospermum mearnsii, commonly known as the Mearns' false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, white hairs. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with five petals and a central disk, and it produces small, dry fruits called capsules.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum mearnsii has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy and have a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and branching, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from summer to fall and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum mearnsii is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the eastern and northeastern parts of the country, including areas such as KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga. This plant thrives in open woodland and grassland habitats, often growing along roadsides and in disturbed soils. It is well adapted to the warm, humid climate of these regions.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is also occasionally reported in parts of Mozambique and Zimbabwe.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum mearnsii was mainly introduced to South Africa.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive flowers and foliage. The species has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the Western Cape. It is often found growing in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in the region and poses minimal ecological threat.</p>
