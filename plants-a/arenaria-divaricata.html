                    <h1>Arenaria divaricata</h1>
<p>Arenaria divaricata, commonly known as the variable sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
