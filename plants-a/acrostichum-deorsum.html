                <h1>Acrostichum deorsum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum deorsum, commonly known as the upland fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The plant has large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green and glossy on top. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum deorsum plays an important role in maintaining ecological balance by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum deorsum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are elongated, dark green on top, and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture and a broad arrangement along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is robust, upright, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows in a vertical pattern. It produces inconspicuous, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spadices, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after drying.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum deorsum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and ample sunlight. This fern is commonly found in coastal and mangrove ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local biodiversity. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, such as Papua New Guinea and Fiji.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes be found in disturbed or secondary growth habitats within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum deorsum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive fronds. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in wetland habitats. The plant spreads rapidly through its rhizomes, making it difficult to control.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
