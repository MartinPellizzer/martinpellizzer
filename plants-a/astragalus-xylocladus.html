                    <h1>Astragalus xylocladus</h1>
<p>Astragalus xylocladus, commonly known as the sand milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, compound leaves and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Astragalus xylocladus plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
