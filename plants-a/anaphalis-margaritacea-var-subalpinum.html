<p>Anaphalis margaritacea var. subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine ragwort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, clustered yellow flowers that resemble tiny buttons. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous environments.</p>
<p>The variety subalpinum is distinguished by its more compact growth form and slightly different flower structure compared to the typical form.</p>
