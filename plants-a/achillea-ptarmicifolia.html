                <h1>Achillea ptarmicifolia</h1>
<p>Achillea ptarmicifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant features slender, gray-green leaves with a distinctive serrated edge, and it produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties have been historically valued for their anti-inflammatory and astringent effects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea ptarmicifolia has basal, lance-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture and a pointed tip, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are flat-topped umbels composed of small, white to pale yellow florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, achene with a pappus, allowing wind dispersal of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea ptarmicifolia is primarily native to the North Caucasus and Transcaucasus region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous areas within these regions. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments with well-drained soils. It is often seen in grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the Caucasus mountain range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea ptarmicifolia was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities, featuring bright yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Its introduction has been particularly beneficial in arid and semi-arid regions where vegetation is sparse.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-target environments.</p>
