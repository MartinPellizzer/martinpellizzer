                <h1>Adenia elegans</h1>
<p>Adenia elegans, commonly known as the elegant adenium, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and striking, palmate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia elegans has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a fleshy, yellowish berry that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by birds and mammals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia elegans is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the eastern and southern regions of the island, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments. It is commonly found in moist forests and along stream banks. Adenia elegans is adapted to the unique flora and climate of Madagascar, which is known for its high biodiversity.</p>
<p>The species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia elegans was mainly introduced to the eastern and southeastern regions of Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along streamlines. The plant is commonly found in coastal and subtropical areas where the climate supports its growth. It has been successfully established in both natural and cultivated settings.</p>
<p>Its introduction has contributed to the biodiversity of these regions, although it is not considered invasive.</p>
