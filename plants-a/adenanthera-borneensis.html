                <h1>Adenanthera borneensis</h1>
<p>Adenanthera borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean burr legume, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive pod-like fruits. The plant produces yellow flowers that are arranged in racemes, and its seeds are encased in tough, spiny pods. Adenanthera borneensis is adapted to tropical climates and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in lowland and hill forest areas.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems and has been studied for its potential uses in traditional medicine and as a source of timber.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthera borneensis has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that are usually pale green in color and measure around 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical and slightly woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, and have yellow petals with a prominent central stamen; they bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a slender, cylindrical pod that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera borneensis is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this island, which is shared by Brunei, Indonesia, and Malaysia. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments within the dense canopy of lowland and hill forests. It is commonly seen in the understorey layers of these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the island of Borneo, where it plays a role in the local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera borneensis was mainly introduced to improve soil fertility through its nitrogen-fixing ability.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in agroforestry systems to enhance crop productivity. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it suitable for regions with warm, humid conditions. It has been introduced in various parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its introduction has provided ecological and agricultural benefits by supporting sustainable land management practices.</p>
