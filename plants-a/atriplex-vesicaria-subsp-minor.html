<p>Atriplex vesicaria subsp.</p>
<p>minor, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, a key adaptation to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Its salt tolerance makes it an important component of saline soils and a valuable plant for ecological restoration.</p>
