                    <h1>Arum crudele</h1>
<p>Arum crudele, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a member of the Araceae family and is native to various parts of Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant that produces striking, dark purple berries that are highly toxic due to the presence of tropane alkaloids. The plant's leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, with a glossy surface, and its flowers are clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in households.</p>
