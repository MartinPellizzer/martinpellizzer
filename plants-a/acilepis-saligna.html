                <h1>Acilepis saligna</h1>
<p>Acilepis saligna, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub or tree that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are pinnate, with narrow, silky hairs that give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and often has a pale or greyish color.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis saligna has leaves that are elongated and lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a vertical growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis saligna is primarily native to Assam, Bangladesh, China South-Central, China Southeast, East Himalaya, India, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these areas. This plant thrives in moist, forested environments and is often associated with riverine and hillside habitats. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that plays an important ecological role in its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse climates and soil conditions of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis saligna was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and potential for erosion control.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread throughout various regions, particularly in the North Island. Despite its initial purpose, it has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is adaptable to different climatic conditions, contributing to its spread.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its proliferation and mitigate its impact on native flora.</p>
