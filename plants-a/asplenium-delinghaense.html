                    <h1>Asplenium delinghaense</h1>
<p>Asplenium delinghaense, commonly known as the Delingha spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to high-altitude regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or soil in mountainous areas. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the leaves, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
