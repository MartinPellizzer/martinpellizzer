                        <h1>Acacia collegialis</h1>
<p>Acacia collegialis, commonly known as the white acacia, is a shrub native to parts of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, feathery leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are a key feature during its flowering season. Acacia collegialis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various small animals and insects.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia collegialis belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, leaves, and roots. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their primitive vascular structures and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that are often legumes and have symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, characterized by pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive acorn-like seed pods and often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia collegialis, a specific type of acacia found in certain regions, noted for its unique characteristics and ecological role.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia collegialis is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the sandy soils of the coastal regions and inland areas of the state. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in shrublands and open woodlands. Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern and western parts of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia collegialis was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered a potential weed in some regions. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas where it can establish itself along roadsides and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential remains a topic of ongoing ecological study.</p>
