<p>Anacyclus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy crownflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lobed leaves and produces yellow to orange flowers in the spring. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh environments. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Anacyclus pubescens is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in desert ecosystems.</p>
