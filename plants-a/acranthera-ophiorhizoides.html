                <h1>Acranthera ophiorhizoides</h1>
<p>Acranthera ophiorhizoides, commonly known as the white-flowered acranthera, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassland or woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Acranthera ophiorhizoides is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera ophiorhizoides has leaves that are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and grows upright, with a light green bark that is thin and smooth. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, clustered in terminal inflorescences, and bloom during the rainy season; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera ophiorhizoides is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in areas with moist, shaded habitats. It is typically associated with limestone soils and grows in the understory of dense vegetation. The plant is known for its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom during the wet season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera ophiorhizoides was mainly introduced to regions with moist, well-drained soils and a subtropical to tropical climate.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with partial to full sun exposure. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. It has been reported in several countries in Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
