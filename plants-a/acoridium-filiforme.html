                <h1>Acoridium filiforme</h1>
<p>Acoridium filiforme, commonly known as the slender spikerush, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Alismataceae.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and shallow waters. The plant features slender, thread-like stems that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Acoridium filiforme plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoridium filiforme has narrow, elongated leaves that are linear in shape, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, and typically range from 10 to 30 centimeters in length, with a pale green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green to pale brown color, growing upright and branching sparingly. Its flowers are small, greenish-white in color, with three petals and three sepals, blooming during the spring and early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium filiforme is primarily native to the western Pacific, including parts of Australia, Southeast Asia, and the islands of the Malay Archipelago.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in wetlands, marshes, and coastal areas. This plant thrives in humid environments with abundant water and rich soil. It is often associated with mangrove ecosystems and can be found in brackish or freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>Its native range extends across several island nations in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium filiforme was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and moist environments, often thriving in urban and suburban areas. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread via rhizomes make it a potential invasive species in non-native regions. It has been reported in several countries where it competes with native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it poses a challenge for ecological management in invaded areas.</p>
