                <h1>Acmispon maritimus</h1>
<p>Acmispon maritimus, commonly known as coastal clover, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal wind conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Acmispon maritimus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, enhancing soil fertility in coastal ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmispon maritimus has leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is generally grayish-brown in color. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense spikes, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small, dry legume that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant in sandy or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon maritimus is primarily native to Arizona, California, Mexico Northwest, and Nevada.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in coastal and sandy environments within these regions. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in dunes or along shorelines. The species is well adapted to withstand drought and salt spray.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its preference for coastal and inland desert habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon maritimus was mainly introduced to coastal areas and disturbed sites due to its ability to thrive in saline and sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, such as California and parts of Australia. This plant is often used in restoration projects because of its hardy nature and capacity to stabilize dunes. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely influenced by human activity and environmental conditions.</p>
