<p>Acmispon maritimus, commonly known as coastal clover, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal wind conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Acmispon maritimus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, enhancing soil fertility in coastal ecosystems.</p>
