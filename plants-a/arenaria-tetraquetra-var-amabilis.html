<p>Arenaria tetraquetra var. amabilis, commonly known as the pink sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its compact form and delicate appearance make it a characteristic component of alpine flora.</p>
