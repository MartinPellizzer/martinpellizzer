The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize dunes.</p>
