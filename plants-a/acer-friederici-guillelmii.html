<p>Acer friederici-guillelmii, commonly known as the European mountain maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 6â€“12 meters and is characterized by its finely toothed, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 600 and 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and parks in temperate climates.</p>
