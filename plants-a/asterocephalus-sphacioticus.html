                    <h1>Asterocephalus sphacioticus</h1>
<p>Asterocephalus sphacioticus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, star-shaped inflorescence that resembles a celestial body, giving it its scientific name. The plant exhibits a succulent habit, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its arid environment. Its flowers, which bloom at night, emit a faint bioluminescent glow, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Asterocephalus sphacioticus is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
