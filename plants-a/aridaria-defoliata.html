<p>Aridaria defoliata, commonly known as the desert leafless plant, is a succulent shrub adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant typically lacks leaves, reducing water loss through transpiration. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of yellow or orange.</p>
<p>It is found in rocky soils of desert regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
