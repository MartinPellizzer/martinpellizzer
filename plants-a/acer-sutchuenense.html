                <h1>Acer sutchuenense</h1>
<p>Acer sutchuenense, commonly known as the Sichuan maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer sutchuenense has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and a size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically bright green during the growing season and turn yellow or red in the fall. The stem is slender and straight, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellow-green flowers in clusters during spring, which are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer sutchuenense is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan Province in southwestern China.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations within its native range, primarily in the Hengduan Mountains. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils, typically found in temperate forests. This species grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, Acer sutchuenense is classified as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer sutchuenense is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. The growth cycle of Acer sutchuenense involves a dormant phase in winter, followed by active growth in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while pruning should be done in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer sutchuenense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers and abundant nectar. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity by creating a complex habitat structure. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land and reducing runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil quality through leaf litter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer sutchuenense is a species of maple native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine. The tree contributes to local economies through timber and ornamental horticulture, supporting industries that rely on its aesthetic and structural qualities. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its role in biodiversity and habitat support further underscores its ecological importance in native landscapes.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer sutchuenense has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Autumn Flame', which are known for their vibrant fall color. The species is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, such as Acer palmatum, to create unique foliage patterns and growth habits. These hybrids often exhibit enhanced cold hardiness and improved disease resistance.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability, Acer sutchuenense plays a significant role in horticultural landscapes and garden design.</p>
