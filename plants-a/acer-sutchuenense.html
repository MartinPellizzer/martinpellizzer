                <h1>Acer sutchuenense</h1>
<p>Acer sutchuenense, commonly known as the Sichuan maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and has smooth, gray bark. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer sutchuenense has palmate leaves that are typically 5-7 lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is relatively slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellow stamens and a greenish-yellow pistil, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's natural habitat in mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer sutchuenense is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan Province in southwestern China.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Hengduan Mountains. It thrives in humid, temperate environments with well-drained soils and partial to full shade. This species is typically found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat fragmentation and over-collection, Acer sutchuenense is classified as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer sutchuenense is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or grafting, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer sutchuenense includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning to shape the tree and remove diseased branches are essential for its health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot, and it benefits from companion planting with flowering shrubs that attract beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer sutchuenense is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer sutchuenense plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by supporting a wide range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer sutchuenense is a lesser-known maple species native to China, valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to local biodiversity and serves as a habitat for various wildlife species. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in traditional Chinese horticulture and landscape design.</p>
<p>Its role in environmental conservation highlights its importance in maintaining ecological balance in its native regions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer sutchuenense has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that contribute to its horticultural significance.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Flamingo' and 'Crimson Queen,' known for their vibrant autumn foliage. The species has been hybridized with other maple varieties, such as Acer palmatum, to create ornamental trees with enhanced color and growth habits. These hybrids are prized for their compact size and showy leaves, making them popular in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer sutchuenense plays an important role in horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
