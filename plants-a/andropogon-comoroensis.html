<p>Andropogon comoroensis, commonly known as Comoro grass, is a perennial grass native to the Comoros archipelago in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves, which are typically green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in open, sunny areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping or for erosion control in its native habitat.</p>
