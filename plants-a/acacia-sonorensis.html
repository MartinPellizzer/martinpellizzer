                    <h1>Acacia sonorensis</h1>
<p>Acacia sonorensis, commonly known as the Sonoran acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its adaptation to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Acacia sonorensis is well-suited to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a common sight in desert landscapes.</p>
