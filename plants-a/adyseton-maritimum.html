                <h1>Adyseton maritimum</h1>
<p>Adyseton maritimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers and silver-gray leaves, which help it withstand salty sea air. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, thriving in well-drained conditions. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of hair, which reduces water loss and protects against salt spray.</p>
<p>Adyseton maritimum is often used in coastal gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adyseton maritimum has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and has a smooth, greyish-brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout its growth. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white in color, with five petals and a tubular shape, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that release tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to stabilize the plant in sandy coastal soils.</p>
