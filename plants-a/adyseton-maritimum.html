<p>Adyseton maritimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers and silver-gray leaves, which help it withstand salty sea air. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, thriving in well-drained conditions. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of hair, which reduces water loss and protects against salt spray.</p>
<p>Adyseton maritimum is often used in coastal gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
