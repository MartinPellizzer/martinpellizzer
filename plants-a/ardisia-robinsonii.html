                    <h1>Ardisia robinsonii</h1>
<p>Ardisia robinsonii, commonly known as the Robinson's beautyberry, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features glossy, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring. The plant is notable for its bright purple, berry-like fruits that appear in the fall, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ardisia robinsonii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and unique fruit display.</p>
