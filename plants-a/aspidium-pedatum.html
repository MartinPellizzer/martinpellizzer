<p>Aspidium pedatum, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of fern native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive central rib and small, rounded pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Aspidium pedatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
