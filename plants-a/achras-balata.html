                <h1>Achras balata</h1>
<p>Achras balata, commonly known as the rubber tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and produces a milky sap that is rich in latex. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil. Its trunk is typically smooth and can grow quite tall, reaching up to 20 meters in height.</p>
<p>The latex obtained from Achras balata has been historically used in the production of natural rubber.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras balata has large, palmate leaves that are typically 30-50 cm in diameter, with a broad, lobed shape and a deep green color on the upper surface, contrasting with a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a solitary, unbranched tree. The plant produces large, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a spiny, spherical capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are extensive and taproot-like, anchoring the plant deeply in the soil and helping it survive in dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras balata is primarily native to the Caribbean, Central America, and northern South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in countries such as Mexico, Colombia, and Cuba. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates and is often associated with coastal and lowland areas. It is also known to grow in disturbed habitats and secondary forests.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends from southern Florida through the Greater Antilles and into parts of the Amazon Basin.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras balata was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and latex production.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in parts of Central and South America, as well as the Caribbean. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. It has been cultivated in some areas of Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean islands.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
