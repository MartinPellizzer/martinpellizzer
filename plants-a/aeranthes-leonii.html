<p>Aeranthes leonii, commonly known as the Leon's spider orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and its unique, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, thin leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Aeranthes leonii is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts for its striking visual appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
