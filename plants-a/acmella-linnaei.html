                <h1>Acmella linnaei</h1>
<p>Acmella linnaei, commonly known as the zigzag fireweed, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive zigzagging stems. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with red markings, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Acmella linnaei is typically found in moist, sunny habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella linnaei has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively thin throughout its growth. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella linnaei is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. This species thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often associated with lowland and montane rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella linnaei was mainly introduced to the eastern coast of Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal dunes and sandy soils. This plant is known for its bright yellow flowers and ability to thrive in harsh environments. It has been reported as an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native flora.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded due to human activity and coastal development.</p>
