                <h1>Acmella linnaei</h1>
<p>Acmella linnaei, commonly known as the zigzag fireweed, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a bushy growth habit and features hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Its common name derives from the zigzag pattern of its flower clusters, which resemble a fire's flickering movement.</p>
<p>Acmella linnaei is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella linnaei has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a light green bark that is smooth and slightly fibrous, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are yellow with a distinctive red central disc, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the dry season; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella linnaei is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands, particularly found in the Greater Antilles such as Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other tropical regions, including parts of South America and the Pacific Islands. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and coastal areas, often growing in brackish or freshwater environments. This species typically occurs at low altitudes, usually below 100 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acmella linnaei is considered vulnerable, though its conservation status remains poorly documented.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmella linnaei is a flowering plant known for its vibrant, small yellow flowers and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of Acmella linnaei is relatively short, with flowering occurring within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to encourage bushier growth are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and improve garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acmella linnaei is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and insects, due to its bright colors and abundant floral resources. The plant acts as a companion plant in agroecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring crops by improving soil health and deterring pests. Additionally, its dense growth habit helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its root system.</p>
<p>Acmella linnaei also contributes to biodiversity by supporting a variety of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
