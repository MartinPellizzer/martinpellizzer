                <h1>Adenocalymma bilabiatum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma bilabiatum, commonly known as the two-lipped rock heath, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers with two distinct lips. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a glandular surface, which is a notable botanical feature.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma bilabiatum is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma bilabiatum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth texture and a dark green color, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light gray bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma bilabiatum is primarily native to parts of southern Africa, including South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grassland and savanna habitats. This plant thrives in regions with a temperate to semi-arid climate. It is often seen growing in open areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with the natural vegetation of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma bilabiatum was mainly introduced to specific regions in South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape province.</p>
<p>It has been documented in areas such as the Karoo and the Western Cape's mountainous regions. The plant is often found in rocky outcrops and along the edges of fynbos vegetation. Its introduction is likely due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and has minimal impact on native ecosystems.</p>
