                <h1>Adenostoma sparsifolium</h1>
<p>Adenostoma sparsifolium, commonly known as the coastal buckwheat, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and showy clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds, and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Adenostoma sparsifolium plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostoma sparsifolium has narrow, needle-like leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is woody and has a rough, fissured bark that is gray to brown in color, with a bushy growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, rocky soils it inhabits.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostoma sparsifolium is primarily native to California, Mexico Northwest.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the chaparral and scrub habitats of these regions. This plant thrives in areas with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. It is often associated with coastal and inland areas within its native range.</p>
<p>Adenostoma sparsifolium plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostoma sparsifolium was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, disturbed forests, and grasslands.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is commonly found in the western United States. This plant is often considered a weed due to its ability to spread rapidly in disturbed environments. It has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities in certain regions.</p>
