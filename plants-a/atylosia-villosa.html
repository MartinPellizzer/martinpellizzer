                    <h1>Atylosia villosa</h1>
<p>Atylosia villosa, commonly known as the hairy lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. Atylosia villosa is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and meadows.</p>
<p>Its hairy stems and leaves help it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
