                <h1>Aechmea amazonica</h1>
<p>Aechmea amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian urn plant, is a bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure, which forms a central cup to collect rainwater. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, and they can grow up to 3 feet in length. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea amazonica has leaves that are typically sword-shaped, arranged in a rosette pattern, and can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a waxy, dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upward from the base of the plant. Its flowers are clustered in a spike at the center of the rosette, featuring bright red bracts with white petals, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind and insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense mat around the base of the plant, helping to anchor it and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>
