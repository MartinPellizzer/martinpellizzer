                    <h1>Aphelexis adhaerens</h1>
<p>Aphelexis adhaerens, commonly known as the sticky vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit and the production of sticky, glandular secretions on its stems and leaves. The plant's leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough, textured surface. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences.</p>
<p>The sticky secretions may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and also aid in seed dispersal.</p>
