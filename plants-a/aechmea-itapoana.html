                <h1>Aechmea itapoana</h1>
<p>Aechmea itapoana, commonly known as the Itapoan bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant features vibrant, long-lasting bracts that display a range of colors, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its foliage is typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Aechmea itapoana is appreciated for its ornamental value and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea itapoana has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, fleshy, and arranged in a tight spiral, with a waxy, dark green surface and a bluish-gray underside.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead having a short, fibrous base that supports the rosette structure. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, with white to pale pink petals that bloom during the rainy season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing moisture from the surrounding environment.</p>
