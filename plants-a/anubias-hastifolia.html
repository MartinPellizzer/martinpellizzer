<p>Anubias hastifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf anubia, is a species of aquatic plant native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. This plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, often found in shaded areas along the edges of ponds and rivers. Anubias hastifolia is popular in aquariums due to its hardiness and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life.</p>
