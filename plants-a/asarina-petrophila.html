<p>Asarina petrophila, commonly known as the mountain asarum, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>

The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical features include a hairy stem and distinctive, aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecosystem health.</p>
