                <h1>Achyranthes sessilis</h1>
<p>Achyranthes sessilis, commonly known as the sessile spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is characterized by its milky sap and often spiny structures. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in open woodlands or along roadsides. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a reddish or purple tinge on the underside.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and clustered in cyathia, a feature typical of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes sessilis has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat woody with a rough texture, and has a brownish color, growing in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with greenish-white petals, blooming from June to September, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, dark brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes sessilis is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in areas with high humidity. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides, waste lands, and agricultural fields. It is also present in parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely influenced by its ability to adapt to a variety of environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes sessilis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and human-altered landscapes.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments such as roadsides, waste areas, and cultivated fields. This plant has been reported in several regions across Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia. Its introduction is often associated with human activity, such as agriculture and land development.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if left unchecked.</p>
