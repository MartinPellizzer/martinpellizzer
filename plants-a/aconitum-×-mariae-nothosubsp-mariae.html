<p>mariae, commonly known as the Alpine Monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple to blue hooded flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with large, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in alpine meadows and forested areas.</p>
<p>The plant is noted for its ornamental value and is cultivated in gardens for its dramatic floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum × mariae nothosubsp.</p>
<p>mariae has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is tall and erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age.</p>
<p>Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petal-like sepals and numerous stamens, blooming in late summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, adapted for absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>

<p>mariae is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe, particularly in the Carpathian and Alps. Its current distribution includes parts of Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, and Slovakia, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest understories. It prefers cool, humid environments with well-drained, loamy soils at altitudes ranging from 800 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural propagation, it is considered endangered in many of its native regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aconitum × mariae nothosubsp.</p>
<p>mariae is a striking perennial plant known for its tall, spire-like flowers and dark green foliage. It can be propagated through seed sowing or division of established clumps, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination.</p>
<p>This plant has a biennial growth cycle, with the first year focused on root development and the second year producing flowers before dying back. It thrives in well-drained, moist soil and requires regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and pruning of dead foliage in late fall helps maintain its vigor.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs, and it benefits from companion planting with hostas or ferns for added visual appeal.</p>
