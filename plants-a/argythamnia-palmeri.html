<p>Argythamnia palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and bracts. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its leaves are usually spiny and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The showy yellow flowers bloom in the spring and are followed by small, woody fruits that disperse seeds via the wind.</p>
