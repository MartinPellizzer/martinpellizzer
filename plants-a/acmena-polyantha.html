                <h1>Acmena polyantha</h1>
<p>Acmena polyantha, commonly known as the Chinese starfruit or yellow bell tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, star-shaped fruits that are typically yellow or orange when mature. These fruits are edible, though they have a tart flavor and are often used in culinary applications.</p>
<p>Acmena polyantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena polyantha has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a globose capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena polyantha is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia, specifically found in Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including the United States and Europe, due to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys, often growing in clay or loamy soils. Acmena polyantha typically grows at altitudes between 200 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, habitat loss and over-collection pose threats to its wild populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmena polyantha is a small evergreen shrub known for its fragrant white flowers and glossy leaves, often cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-ripe cuttings or by seeds, with cuttings offering a more reliable method for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 3 to 5 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
