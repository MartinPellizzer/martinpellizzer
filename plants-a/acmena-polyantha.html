<p>Acmena polyantha, commonly known as the Chinese hibiscus, is a deciduous shrub native to southern China and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in summer. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter underside. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Acmena polyantha is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena polyantha has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as an upright shrub. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in umbels, and bloom in spring; they are primarily pollinated by insects.

<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena polyantha is primarily native to eastern Australia, including the states of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in subtropical and temperate rainforests, as well as in coastal areas and rocky outcrops. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often associated with eucalyptus and rainforest vegetation. It is known for its attractive, showy flowers that bloom in spring and summer.</p>
<p>Acmena polyantha is an important component of the native flora in these regions, contributing to biodiversity and ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena polyantha was mainly introduced to urban and suburban gardens in Australia due to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and temperate regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant is often cultivated for its showy, fragrant white flowers that appear in spring. It has been reported as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to increased management efforts in natural ecosystems.</p>
