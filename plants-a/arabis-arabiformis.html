                    <h1>Arabis arabiformis</h1>
<p>Arabis arabiformis, commonly known as the Arabian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar environmental conditions.</p>
