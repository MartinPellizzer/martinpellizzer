                    <h1>Agrostis producta</h1>
<p>Agrostis producta, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Agrostis producta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in turfgrass management due to its fine texture and durability.</p>
