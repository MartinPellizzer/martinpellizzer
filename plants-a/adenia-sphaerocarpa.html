                <h1>Adenia sphaerocarpa</h1>
<p>Adenia sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globular adenium, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, waxy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>However, it should be handled with care, as its sap can be toxic.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia sphaerocarpa has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are relatively large, measuring up to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is dark brown to black in color, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern, often twining around supports. The flowers are large, showy, and borne in clusters, with a white or pale pink color, featuring a distinctive spurred shape; they bloom during the wet season and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a spherical, woody capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia sphaerocarpa is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the dry, arid regions of the island, particularly in the southern and western parts. This plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in coastal areas and dry forests. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of Madagascar, with its thick, fleshy leaves helping it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its unique characteristics, it is considered an important part of the island's biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia sphaerocarpa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native species for resources. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can grow in both full sun and partial shade.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative propagation have made it a concern for local ecosystems.</p>
