                <h1>Acrostichum cinereum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum cinereum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a perennial fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its reproductive structures include sori, which are clusters of spores found on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum cinereum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cinereum has large, leathery leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a smooth texture. The stem is stout and upright, with a rough, fibrous bark that darkens with age. Acrostichum cinereum produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer and are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses its seeds by wind, and the plant has a fibrous root system that helps anchor it in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cinereum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland areas, including rainforests and wetlands. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems. It is also present in some parts of the Caribbean and southern Florida.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to coastal and riverine habitats where it can access the high humidity and nutrient-rich soils it requires.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cinereum was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant thrives in saline and brackish environments, making it well-suited for estuarine habitats. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
