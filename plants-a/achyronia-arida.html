<p>Achyronia arida, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Achyronia arida is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
