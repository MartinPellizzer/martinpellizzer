                <h1>Actinostachys trilateralis</h1>
<p>Actinostachys trilateralis, commonly known as the three-angled sword fern, is a tropical fern native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive triangular, sword-shaped fronds that are often divided into segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically evergreen, providing a lush green appearance throughout the year.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinostachys trilateralis has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 10 to 20 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, and have a pale greenish-white color, blooming during the summer months and relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind when it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostachys trilateralis is primarily native to Central America, Mexico, and parts of the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and rivers. It is often associated with disturbed or open habitats where it can establish quickly.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes countries such as Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and the southern states of Texas and Florida.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostachys trilateralis was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It was initially brought in for its ornamental value due to its attractive, sword-shaped leaves and ability to thrive in wetland environments. The plant has since spread beyond its original introduction sites, often establishing itself in disturbed or flooded areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its classification as an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>However, it remains a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates.</p>
