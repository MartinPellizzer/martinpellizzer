                    <h1>Androrchis × jailae</h1>
<p>Androrchis × jailae, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring cross between two orchid species, Androrchis luteus and Androrchis calamus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that exhibit a mix of traits from both parent species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. Its inflorescence consists of several showy, spurred flowers that attract pollinators like bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by gardeners interested in rare and exotic orchids.</p>
