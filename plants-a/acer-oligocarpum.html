                <h1>Acer oligocarpum</h1>
<p>Acer oligocarpum, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and prefers well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer oligocarpum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in panicles, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer oligocarpum is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China, specifically in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations, primarily in subtropical and temperate forests. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers shaded to semi-shaded environments within mixed forests. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Acer oligocarpum is considered critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer oligocarpum is a rare maple species known for its unique ornamental value and slow growth rate.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, making it ideal for long-term landscape planning.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture levels, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization should be minimal to avoid overstimulation, and pruning is best done in late winter to maintain its natural form.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may benefit from companion planting with species like lavender or heather to improve soil health and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer oligocarpum is a small, deciduous tree that provides habitat and food for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. Its dense foliage offers shelter to small mammals and birds, enhancing the ecological complexity of the area.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer oligocarpum helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system, stabilizing soil and preventing runoff.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer oligocarpum is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use due to its small, bitter seeds.</p>
<p>However, it holds potential for medicinal applications, as some studies suggest its extracts may possess antioxidant properties. In terms of industrial and economic value, it is primarily of interest for ecological research and conservation efforts rather than commercial exploitation. Culturally, it contributes to biodiversity and serves as an important indicator species in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Overall, its role is more ecological and scientific than practical in everyday use.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer oligocarpum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are of interest in horticulture.</p>
<p>Some popular cultivars include 'Aconitifolium' and 'Karl Seppelt', known for their striking foliage and ornamental value. While pure hybrids of Acer oligocarpum are less common, it is occasionally crossed with other maple species to create unique cultivars. These plants are valued for their vibrant autumn colors and adaptability to various garden settings.</p>
<p>Their horticultural importance lies in their aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in temperate climates.</p>
