                <h1>Acer oligocarpum</h1>
<p>Acer oligocarpum, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves that are typically 5-9 lobes, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds known as samaras. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer oligocarpum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface that turns red in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and grows upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer oligocarpum is a rare and critically endangered species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>Historically, it was found in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, but its current distribution is extremely limited, with only a few scattered populations remaining. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes, typically at altitudes between 1,800 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and overcollection, Acer oligocarpum is now listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer oligocarpum is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its unique foliage and slow growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification to break dormancy. The growth cycle of Acer oligocarpum is relatively slow, with new growth appearing in spring and foliage turning vibrant colors in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture levels, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of balanced fertilizer in spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and encourage healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may benefit from companion plants like ferns or heathers that enhance soil moisture retention and biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer oligocarpum is a rare maple species that provides habitat and food for various wildlife, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by offering shelter and contributing to nutrient cycling in the soil.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer oligocarpum is a lesser-known species of maple native to China, primarily found in the mountainous regions of Yunnan and Sichuan.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been traditionally used in local herbal remedies. The wood of Acer oligocarpum is valued for its durability and fine grain, making it suitable for crafting and small-scale woodworking industries. Culturally, it holds significance in traditional Chinese medicine and is sometimes symbolized in regional folklore.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized uses, Acer oligocarpum plays a minor but notable role in both ecological and cultural contexts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer oligocarpum has a limited number of naturally occurring varieties, but it is not widely cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>
<p>Some popular cultivars include 'Globemaster' and 'Crimson King,' which are prized for their unique foliage colors and compact growth habits. Hybrids of Acer oligocarpum are rare due to its low genetic diversity and limited crossability with other maple species. Despite its ornamental potential, it remains of lesser horticultural importance compared to more commonly cultivated maples like Acer rubrum or Acer palmatum.</p>
<p>Its rarity and specific growing requirements make it a niche choice for specialized gardens.</p>
