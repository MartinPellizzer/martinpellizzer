                <h1>Adenocline ovalifolia</h1>
<p>Adenocline ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf adenocline, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is typically compact, with multiple stems emerging from the base.</p>
<p>Adenocline ovalifolia is drought-tolerant and prefers well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocline ovalifolia has leaves that are oval in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern with branching occurring from the base. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocline ovalifolia is primarily native to the western regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and northern Chile.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Andean mountain ranges, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. This plant typically grows in rocky or semi-arid habitats, often in areas with poor soil conditions. Its distribution is limited to these specific ecological zones, making it a characteristic species of the Andean flora.</p>
<p>Adenocline ovalifolia is adapted to the cool and dry climate of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocline ovalifolia was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in woodland and forest understory environments. This plant is known for its oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. It has been introduced to several regions for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
