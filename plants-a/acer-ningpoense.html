                <h1>Acer ningpoense</h1>
<p>Acer ningpoense, commonly known as the Ningpo maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is known for its ornamental value in gardens. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and prefers well-drained soil.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and inconspicuous, while the fruit is a samara with a winged structure.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer ningpoense has leaves that are palmately lobed, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5-10 cm in length and width, with a crisp texture and a serrated margin. The stem is straight and slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and borne in clusters.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer ningpoense is a species of maple native to eastern China, specifically found in the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to fragmented areas within its native range due to habitat loss and degradation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and streamside areas. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Acer ningpoense is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer ningpoense is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its vibrant autumn foliage and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer ningpoense includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by dormancy in winter, with flowering occurring in early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, but is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches promotes healthy growth. Common pests include aphids and scale insects, while diseases like powdery mildew can occur in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its ornamental value and support beneficial insect populations.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer ningpoense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring flowers. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil health. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer ningpoense contributes to carbon sequestration and offers aesthetic value to its environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer ningpoense is a species of maple native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds may have minor roles in traditional practices. In medicinal contexts, it has been studied for potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and supports local ecosystems, enhancing economic activities related to conservation and ecotourism.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and natural beauty, often featured in local landscapes and artistic expressions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
