                <h1>Acer ningpoense</h1>
<p>Acer ningpoense, commonly known as the Ningpo maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall, making it a popular ornamental species. The tree typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and has a spreading crown. Its flowers are small and yellow-green, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and gray, with shallow vertical fissures that become more pronounced with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer ningpoense has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a pointed tip and serrated edges, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, turning bright red in autumn. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellow-green flowers in clusters during spring, pollinated by wind, and the fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer ningpoense is a rare species of maple native to China, specifically found in the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the mountainous regions of eastern China. It thrives in humid, subtropical environments with well-drained soil and partial shade. This species typically grows at altitudes between 600 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Acer ningpoense is listed as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer ningpoense is a species of maple tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification to break dormancy. The growth cycle of Acer ningpoense includes a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for its health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with other shade-tolerant plants in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer ningpoense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecosystem health. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer ningpoense supports soil stability and offers ecological benefits by improving air quality.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer ningpoense is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to local biodiversity and supports wildlife, though it is not a major commercial crop. Culturally, it is appreciated for its aesthetic beauty and is sometimes used in landscaping and horticulture.</p>
<p>Symbolically, it represents resilience and natural beauty in Chinese botanic traditions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer ningpoense has several popular cultivars, including 'Variegatum' and 'Atrosanguineum', which are prized for their striking foliage colors and ornamental value.</p>
<p>The species is also used in hybridization to create new varieties with enhanced traits such as improved cold hardiness and unique leaf patterns. These hybrids often combine the aesthetic qualities of Acer ningpoense with the adaptability of other maple species. Horticulturally, Acer ningpoense is important for its role in landscape design and its contribution to genetic diversity in ornamental maples.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids are widely cultivated in gardens and public spaces around the world.</p>
