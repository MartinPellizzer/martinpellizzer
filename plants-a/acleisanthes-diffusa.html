                <h1>Acleisanthes diffusa</h1>
<p>Acleisanthes diffusa, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual with slender, branching stems and small, trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning. The flowers are typically pale blue to violet and are adapted to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has small, hairy leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>It is well-suited to dry environments and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes diffusa has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing in a spreading shrub form. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in terminal spikes, with a simple structure that relies on wind pollination, blooming primarily during the spring and early summer. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in the plant's ability to thrive in arid or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes diffusa is primarily native to New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southern and western regions of these states. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed soils and open areas. It is known for its showy yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the specific ecological conditions present in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes diffusa was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Arizona.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils along roadsides, railroads, and in urban areas. This species is often considered an invasive plant due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and can spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
