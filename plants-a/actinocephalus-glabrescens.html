                <h1>Actinocephalus glabrescens</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-headed daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces showy, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that become smooth as the plant matures. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Actinocephalus glabrescens is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus glabrescens has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale green to reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing it to absorb moisture efficiently from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus glabrescens is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in the coastal regions of southeastern Brazil. It thrives in sandy soils along the shoreline. The plant is well adapted to the humid and tropical climate of the area.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is often found in dune environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus glabrescens was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, open woodlands, and agricultural areas. The plant spreads rapidly through its extensive root system and seed production, leading to competitive exclusion of native vegetation. Its introduction is believed to be associated with human activity, including the movement of soil and plant material.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it poses a threat to local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
