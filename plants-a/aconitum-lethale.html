                <h1>Aconitum lethale</h1>
<p>Aconitum lethale, commonly known as the deadly aconite, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. The plant produces striking blue or purple flowers in late summer, which are often clustered in dense racemes. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a waxy texture, typical of many members of its family.</p>
<p>However, all parts of the plant contain toxic alkaloids, making it highly dangerous to both animals and humans.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum lethale has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring up to 20 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth, dark purple to black in color, and grows upright with a woody base. The flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in racemes, blooming in late summer; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through a slit, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, adapted for absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum lethale is primarily native to the East Himalaya, Myanmar, Nepal, Tibet, and West Himalaya.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in alpine and subalpine regions within these areas. It thrives in rocky and mountainous terrains at high altitudes. The plant is well adapted to the cold and moist conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum lethale was mainly introduced to North America through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is now considered an invasive species in several regions, particularly in the eastern United States. The plant spreads rapidly through its prolific seed production and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. It outcompetes native vegetation, leading to ecological imbalances in invaded habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic nature, it poses a significant risk to both livestock and humans.</p>
