                    <h1>Andropogon holcoides</h1>
<p>Andropogon holcoides, commonly known as wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-gray hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in longleaf pine ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Wiregrass plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native habitats.</p>
