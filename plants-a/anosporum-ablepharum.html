<p>Anosporum ablepharum, commonly known as the naked spore liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, leafy liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant lacks true roots and has a thalloid structure composed of a flat, ribbon-like body covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. Its reproductive structures are reduced, and it reproduces primarily through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Anosporum ablepharum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
