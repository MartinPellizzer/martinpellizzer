                <h1>Achillea tzvelevii</h1>
<p>Achillea tzvelevii, commonly known as the Tzvelev's yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and flat-topped clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun. It is known for its aromatic foliage and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea tzvelevii has leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a grayish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and branched, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets, blooming in late summer to early autumn and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>
