                <h1>Adiantum balansae</h1>
<p>Adiantum balansae, commonly known as the Balansae maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its fronds are pinnately divided with a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance.</p>
<p>Adiantum balansae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum balansae has fern-like leaves that are finely divided, with a triangular shape and a delicate, lace-like appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a silvery underside. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth texture and a light greenish hue, growing in a clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, typically blooming in early spring.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum balansae is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically occurring in the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>It is found in states such as Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia. This fern typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these regions.</p>
<p>Adiantum balansae is an endemic species, meaning it is not found anywhere else in the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum balansae was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. This fern is often cultivated in gardens due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions. It has been reported in several states including Pennsylvania, New York, and Maryland.</p>
<p>The plant's introduction is likely due to both natural dispersal and human activity.</p>
