<p>Ammanthus tomentellus, commonly known as the woolly ammannia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores.</p>
<p>Ammanthus tomentellus is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
