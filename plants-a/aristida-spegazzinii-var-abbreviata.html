<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
