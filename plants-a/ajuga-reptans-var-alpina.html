                    <h1>Ajuga reptans var. alpina</h1>
<p>Ajuga reptans var. alpina, commonly known as alpine bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
