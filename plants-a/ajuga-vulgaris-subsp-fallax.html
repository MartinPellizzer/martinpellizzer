<p>Ajuga vulgaris subsp.</p>
<p>fallax, commonly known as autumn ajuga, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and western Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, ovate leaves that are often slightly hairy.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in early to mid-summer, which are borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it an effective ground cover in shaded gardens.</p>
