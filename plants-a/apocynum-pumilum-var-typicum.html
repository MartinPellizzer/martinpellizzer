                    <h1>Apocynum pumilum var. typicum</h1>
<p>Apocynum pumilum var. typicum, commonly known as the small milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its milky sap contains cardiac glycosides, making it toxic to humans and livestock.</p>
<p>It plays a role in supporting specific pollinators, though it is less commonly cultivated than other milkweed species.</p>
