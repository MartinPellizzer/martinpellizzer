                    <h1>Andicolea lycopodinea</h1>
<p>Andicolea lycopodinea, commonly known as the mossy clubmoss, is a small, primitive plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of the branches. Andicolea lycopodinea thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology reflects its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era.</p>
