                <h1>Actephila latifolia</h1>
<p>Actephila latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf actephila, is a flowering plant species belonging to the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, with prominent stamens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Actephila latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila latifolia has broad, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white with five petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, three-valved capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when dry.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila latifolia is primarily native to the Lesser Sunda Is., New Guinea, and Queensland.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and understoreys. Its distribution spans across parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>The species is well adapted to the humid and warm climates of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila latifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a potential weed in certain regions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and can spread through its rhizomes.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
