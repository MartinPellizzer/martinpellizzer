<p>Acaena adenocarpa var. pedicellata, commonly known as the redfruit burr, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny growth and produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are clustered in tight, spherical formations. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Its fruits are adapted for animal dispersal, as they stick to the fur or feathers of passing animals.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other parts of the world.</p>
