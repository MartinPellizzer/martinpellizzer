                <h1>Aconitum caucasicum</h1>
<p>Aconitum caucasicum, commonly known as Caucasian monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It features striking dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive hooded flower that is typically purple or blue. The plant belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its toxic alkaloids, which make it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and toxic properties, it is both cultivated and carefully handled in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum caucasicum has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is tall, upright, and cylindrical, with a smooth, dark brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense spike-like inflorescences, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies; they typically bloom in late summer. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients and surviving in harsh environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum caucasicum is primarily native to the Caucasus region, including parts of Georgia, Russia, and Turkey.</p>
<p>It thrives in mountainous areas with cool, moist climates. This plant is commonly found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. It is well adapted to the temperate and subarctic conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution extends into parts of Central Asia as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum caucasicum was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue-purple flowers and attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the continent in the late 19th century by botanists and horticulturists interested in exotic species for garden cultivation. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since spread beyond cultivated areas, establishing itself in wildlands and natural habitats. The plant's introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to outcompete native flora in certain regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now documented in several states across the United States, particularly in the Pacific Northwest and along the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
