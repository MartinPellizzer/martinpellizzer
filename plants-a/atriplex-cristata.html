                    <h1>Atriplex cristata</h1>
<p>Atriplex cristata, commonly known as the crested saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in spikelike inflorescences. Its leaves are usually small and scale-like, reducing surface area to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Atriplex cristata is well adapted to saline soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes.</p>
