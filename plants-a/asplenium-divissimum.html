<p>Asplenium divissimum, commonly known as the slender spleenworts, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with dense, clustered leaves that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Asplenium divissimum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in moist, well-drained substrates.</p>
