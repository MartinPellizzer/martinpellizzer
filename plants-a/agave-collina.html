                    <h1>Agave collina</h1>
<p>Agave collina, commonly known as the mountain agave, is a species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial succulent characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that store water. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring. Agave collina thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>Its structure and physiology reflect its evolutionary adaptation to survive in low-water conditions.</p>
