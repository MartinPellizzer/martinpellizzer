                    <h1>Agave calciphila</h1>
<p>Agave calciphila, commonly known as the limestone agave, is a perennial succulent native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in alkaline soils, often found on limestone outcrops, which is reflected in its scientific name. The plant features a rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, aiding in water retention. It produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears yellow-green flowers, which bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Agave calciphila is well adapted to drought and high temperatures, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
