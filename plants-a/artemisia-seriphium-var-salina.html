                    <h1>Artemisia seriphium var. salina</h1>
<p>Artemisia seriphium var. salina, commonly known as the saltbush artemisia, is a perennial shrub native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are adapted to absorb water from saline soils, making it resilient to drought and high salinity.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve habitat for native wildlife.</p>
