                <h1>Adamsia rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Adamsia rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leafed Adamsia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 15 centimeters. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are densely packed along its stems. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adamsia rotundifolia has rounded, waxy leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in diameter, arranged in a rosette pattern, and exhibit a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamsia rotundifolia is primarily native to the southern tip of South America, specifically the islands of Tierra del Fuego and the surrounding maritime regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in the cold, temperate climate of this area, often found in coastal and rocky habitats. This plant is adapted to the strong winds and nutrient-rich soils typical of the region. It plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic areas due to its sensitivity to environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamsia rotundifolia was mainly introduced to coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest in the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive, rounded leaves and showy blue flowers. The plant has since spread along rocky shorelines and tidal zones, often outcompeting native species. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, making it a persistent invader in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its establishment has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local biodiversity.</p>
