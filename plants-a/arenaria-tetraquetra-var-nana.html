                    <h1>Arenaria tetraquetra var. nana</h1>
<p>Arenaria tetraquetra var. nana, commonly known as dwarf sand-verbena, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
