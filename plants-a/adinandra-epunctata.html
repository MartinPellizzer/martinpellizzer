                <h1>Adinandra epunctata</h1>
<p>Adinandra epunctata, commonly known as the punctate adinandra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Thymelaeaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or yellow in color. Its leaves are usually simple and alternate, with a rough texture.</p>
<p>Adinandra epunctata is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and rocky areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra epunctata has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and slightly hairy, with a greyish-brown bark that peels off in thin layers. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra epunctata is primarily native to Hainan.</p>
<p>It is a species of flowering plant found in the tropical regions of this island. The plant thrives in the warm and humid climate typical of Hainan's forests. It is often found in lowland and hillside areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to this specific region in China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra epunctata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and degraded forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions where there is ample sunlight. The plant is often found in lowland areas with moderate to high rainfall. Its introduction has been linked to human activities, including land clearing and gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
