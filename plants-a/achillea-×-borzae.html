                <h1>Achillea × borzae</h1>
<p>Achillea × borzae, commonly known as the hybrid yarrow, is a perennial plant that belongs to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Achillea millefolium (common yarrow) and Achillea × triacanthia, resulting in a plant with distinctive botanical features. The leaves are finely divided and feathery, while the flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters. It is native to Europe and is often found in meadows and dry grasslands.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × borzae has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface, arranged in a rosette formation and measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is somewhat branched towards the top. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a cypsela, a small, dry, one-seeded achene, which is dispersed by wind due to its pappus structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × borzae is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans, particularly in parts of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes cultivation in various parts of Europe, though it remains rare in the wild. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as meadows and rocky slopes. This plant is typically found at altitudes ranging from 600 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and rarity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>[WRONG START] Achillea × borzaa is a hybrid perennial plant known for its vibrant, flat-topped flower heads and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes in early spring or fall. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in spring and early summer, with a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with the soil allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea × borzae is a perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both floral resources and habitat. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting beneficial insect populations. Its dense growth also helps with erosion control by stabilizing soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea × borzae contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and promoting a balanced ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>[WRONG START] Achillea × borzaa is a hybrid plant primarily known for its ornamental value in gardens and landscaping due to its attractive, feathery foliage and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, it may be occasionally used in herbal teas or as a garnish in certain traditional cuisines. In medicinal contexts, it has been explored for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties, though scientific validation remains limited. Industrially, it contributes to the horticultural economy by being a popular choice for gardeners and landscapers.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and healing, often appearing in floral arrangements and symbolic art.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea × borzae has a limited number of recognized cultivars, with 'Aurea' being one of the most popular for its bright yellow foliage and delicate white flowers.</p>
<p>While it is primarily a naturally occurring hybrid between Achillea millefolium and Achillea ptarmica, few intentional hybrids have been developed specifically for this species. Its horticultural importance lies in its ornamental value, particularly in garden settings where its compact growth and long blooming period make it a desirable addition.</p>
<p>However, due to its limited cultivation, it remains less common than other members of the Achillea genus.</p>
