                        <h1>Acalypha hederacea var. orbicularis</h1>
<p>Acalypha hederacea var. orbicularis, commonly known as the velvetleaf or orbicular acalypha, is a tropical plant characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically a deep green with a distinctive waxy texture, and they often have a reddish or purple tinge on the underside. It produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that are not particularly showy but are followed by fluffy, cotton-like seed heads. This plant is native to parts of Asia and is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique foliage.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha hederacea var. orbicularis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing along stream banks or in dense forest understories. It is also known to occur in parts of the Pacific Islands, such as the Philippines and New Guinea.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to regions with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha hederacea var. orbicularis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic plant species for landscaping. The plant has since become naturalized in certain areas, spreading through both seed dispersal and vegetative propagation. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is now considered a potential invasive species in some regions of the Pacific.</p>
