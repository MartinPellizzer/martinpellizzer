<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon molle is primarily native to the southern United States, particularly Texas, New Mexico, and parts of Arizona.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky areas and along the edges of deserts. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in limestone soils. It is also found in northern Mexico, including regions such as Chihuahua and Sonora.</p>
<p>Abutilon molle is well adapted to withstand drought conditions and high temperatures.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
