<p>Acer xerophilum, commonly known as the desert maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Acer xerophilum is well adapted to extreme heat and low precipitation, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping and desert landscaping.</p>
