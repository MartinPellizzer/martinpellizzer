                    <h1>Anisosticte</h1>
<p>Anisosticte, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, white, waxy flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically small and strap-like, adapted to its tropical and subtropical habitats.</p>
<p>Anisosticte is native to regions in Southeast Asia and is often found in humid, shaded environments.</p>
