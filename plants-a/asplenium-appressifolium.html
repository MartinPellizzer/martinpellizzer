<p>Asplenium appressifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. Native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and China, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
