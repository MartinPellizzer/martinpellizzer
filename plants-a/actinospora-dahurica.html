                <h1>Actinospora dahurica</h1>
<p>Actinospora dahurica, commonly known as the Siberian lichen, is a type of lichen that thrives in cold, arctic and alpine environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green or yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found growing on tree bark, rocks, and soil in regions with low temperatures and high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an indicator species for environmental health.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinospora dahurica has leaves that are typically lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a pale yellow color, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means, and the seeds are small and winged, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinospora dahurica is primarily native to the mountainous regions of northeastern Asia, including parts of China, Russia, and Korea.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils, often found in forested areas and rocky slopes. This species is particularly associated with the Russian Far East and the Chinese provinces of Heilongjiang and Jilin. It is adapted to cooler temperatures and is commonly found at higher altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited geographic range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinospora dahurica was mainly introduced to the region of eastern Europe and parts of Russia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, temperate forested areas with well-drained soil. This plant has been noted for its ability to thrive in shaded environments. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant species.</p>
