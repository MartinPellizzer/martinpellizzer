                <h1>Acianthera decurrens</h1>
<p>Acianthera decurrens, commonly known as the ascending acianthera, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in a loose raceme. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some botanical gardens and private collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera decurrens has elongated, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in racemes, with a pale pink to white color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera decurrens is primarily native to Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.</p>
<p>This orchid species is commonly found in the Andean regions of these countries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments such as cloud forests and montane grasslands. The plant is known for its delicate, spurred flowers and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of the western South American continent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera decurrens was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 2000s in Oregon and Washington. The plant was likely introduced through horticultural trade or accidental transport via contaminated soil or plant material. It has since spread to moist, shaded habitats in forested areas.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains under study due to its relatively recent establishment.</p>
