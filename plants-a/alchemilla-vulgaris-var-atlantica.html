                    <h1>Alchemilla vulgaris var. atlantica</h1>
<p>Alchemilla vulgaris var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the British Isles.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-green, shield-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking salt-tolerant plants.</p>
