<p>Alismorkis gracilis, commonly known as slender water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with small white flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize the soil and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
<p>Alismorkis gracilis plays a role in water filtration and is often used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
