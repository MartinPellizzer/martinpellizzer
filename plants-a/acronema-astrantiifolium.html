                <h1>Acronema astrantiifolium</h1>
<p>Acronema astrantiifolium, commonly known as the star-leaf acronema, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a distinctive star-like appearance due to the leaf lobes. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native region.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronema astrantiifolium has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema astrantiifolium is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>This species is found in the mountainous regions of this area, where it thrives in humid and temperate climates. It is commonly associated with forests and shaded understory environments. The plant is known for its distinctive foliage and is often found in rocky or forested habitats.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to specific regions within China South-Central, making it a regionally significant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema astrantiifolium was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in urban and suburban areas, particularly in gardens and along roadsides. The plant has spread beyond its original cultivation sites and is now considered a potential weed in certain regions. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils contribute to its invasive potential.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still under study.</p>
