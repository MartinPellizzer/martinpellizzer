<p>Asplenium pulverulentum, commonly known as the powdered spleen fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and often grows on trees or rocky surfaces. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium pulverulentum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
