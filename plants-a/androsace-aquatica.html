                    <h1>Androsace aquatica</h1>
<p>Androsace aquatica, commonly known as water mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist, alpine environments.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it retain water in its often-damp habitat. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. It is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils near streams or in wet meadows.</p>
<p>Androsace aquatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, high-altitude conditions.</p>
