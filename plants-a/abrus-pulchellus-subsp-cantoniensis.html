<p>Abrus pulchellus subsp.</p>
<p>cantoniensis, commonly known as the Canton velvet tare, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, ornamental pods that turn a vibrant red or orange color as they mature.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Native to southern China, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abrus pulchellus subsp.</p>
<p>cantoniensis has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elongated leaflets that are lance-shaped and have a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a climbing vine.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with five pinkish-white petals and a yellowish-green calyx, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a flat, bean-like pod that turns reddish-brown when mature, containing one or two seeds, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their tufted appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and moderately deep, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrus pulchellus subsp.</p>
<p>cantoniensis is a flowering plant native to southern China, particularly in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. While its native range was historically limited, it is now found in several regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Vietnam and Indonesia.</p>
<p>This species thrives in moist, tropical environments such as rainforests and secondary growth areas. It typically grows at altitudes between 200 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its habitat is threatened by deforestation, leading to a decline in its population and conservation concerns.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
