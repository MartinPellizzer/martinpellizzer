                    <h1>Atriplex lurida</h1>
<p>Atriplex lurida, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity.</p>
<p>Atriplex lurida plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
