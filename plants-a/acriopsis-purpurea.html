<p>Acriopsis purpurea, commonly known as the purple cowpea, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple flowers and compound leaves. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisines. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Acriopsis purpurea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties in some cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
