<p>Aspidium foeniculaceum, commonly known as the fern moss or green moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pterobryaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a simple, undifferentiated structure with no true leaves, stems, or roots, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. It is often found in temperate regions, particularly in forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Aspidium foeniculaceum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
