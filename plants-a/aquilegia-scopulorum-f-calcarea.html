                    <h1>Aquilegia scopulorum f. calcarea</h1>
<p>Aquilegia scopulorum f. calcarea, commonly known as the limestone aquilegia, is a rare horticultural form of the European columbine.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost white petals that contrast with its deep green foliage, making it visually striking. This plant thrives in alkaline soils, particularly in limestone-rich environments, and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring, producing clusters of spurred petals that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a specialty plant in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
