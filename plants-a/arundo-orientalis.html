<p>Arundo orientalis, commonly known as the oriental reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in height. This plant thrives in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense stands along riverbanks and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in basket-making and as a source of material for construction.</p>
