                <h1>Achyrospermum seychellarum</h1>
<p>Achyrospermum seychellarum, commonly known as the Seychelles moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the Seychelles.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant has palmate leaves and produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its unique nocturnal blooming habit makes it a notable species in botanical studies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum seychellarum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are cylindrical, smooth, and somewhat woody, with a light green to brownish bark that becomes rougher with age. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and have a white or pale pink color, blooming during the dry season and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's native arid or semi-arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum seychellarum is primarily native to the Seychelles.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical islands of the Indian Ocean, specifically in the Seychelles archipelago. It thrives in the region's humid and warm climate, often growing in coastal or disturbed habitats. The species is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the Seychelles, where it plays a role in local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in the area.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum seychellarum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, daisy-like flowers.</p>
<p>It was first brought there in the late 19th century by European settlers who admired its aesthetic value. Despite its beauty, the plant has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid spread has led to increased management efforts to control its population.</p>
<p>However, it remains a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, decorative plant.</p>
