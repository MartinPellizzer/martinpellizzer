                    <h1>Angiopteris subcuspidata</h1>
<p>Angiopteris subcuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-lobed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and rice fields. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Angiopteris subcuspidata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
