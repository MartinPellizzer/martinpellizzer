The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and thrives in rich, well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures include sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
