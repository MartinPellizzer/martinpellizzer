                <h1>Adiantum globatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum globatum, commonly known as the ball fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded fronds that resemble a ball, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem with closely spaced, clustered fronds. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture.</p>
<p>Adiantum globatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum globatum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with a rounded shape and a delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and they are typically light green in color, with a smooth, glossy texture. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a straight, unbranched pattern. Adiantum globatum produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a spore-bearing capsule that releases spores for dispersal, and the roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum globatum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including states such as Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories and along stream banks. This species is commonly associated with rocky or calcareous soils, which provide the specific conditions it requires for growth. Its distribution is limited to these regions due to its particular ecological needs.</p>
<p>Adiantum globatum is an important component of the local flora in these areas, contributing to biodiversity in woodland habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum globatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and stream sides. This fern is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and delicate, lace-like fronds. It has been reported to spread into natural habitats, raising concerns about its potential invasive behavior.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, its introduction has led to ecological impacts in some local ecosystems.</p>
