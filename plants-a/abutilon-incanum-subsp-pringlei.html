<p>Abutilon incanum subsp.</p>
<p>pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's Abutilon, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are often pubescent, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon incanum subsp.</p>
<p>pringlei has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a gray-green color due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The stem is slender, somewhat woody at the base, with a smooth, light green bark and exhibits a climbing or shrub-like growth pattern.</p>
<p>Its flowers are pendulous, with a structure resembling a bell, in shades of yellow to orange, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon incanum subsp.</p>
<p>pringlei is a rare plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, specifically in Arizona and Sonora. It is currently found in limited areas within its native range, primarily in desert and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in arid environments, often growing in crevices of limestone or sandstone formations. It is typically found at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is listed as endangered or critically endangered in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon incanum subsp.</p>
<p>pringlei is a hardy, shrub-like plant native to South America, known for its fuzzy, silver-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers. It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings offering faster and more reliable results. This plant has a warm-season growth cycle, thriving in spring and summer, and entering dormancy in colder months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, avoiding overwatering to prevent root rot. Fertilization during the growing season with a balanced fertilizer and regular pruning to maintain shape and encourage blooming are essential. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
