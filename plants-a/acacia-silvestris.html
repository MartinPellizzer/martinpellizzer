                    <h1>Acacia silvestris</h1>
<p>Acacia silvestris, commonly known as the wild acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Acacia silvestris plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert wildlife.</p>
