                <h1>Adicea articulata</h1>
<p>Adicea articulata, commonly known as the articulated liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branching, leaf-like structures that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Adicea articulata has a simple structure with no true roots, stems, or leaves, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects its adaptation to humid, temperate climates where it can thrive in the absence of direct sunlight.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea articulata has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly woody, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes rougher with age, growing upright with a branched pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea articulata is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions spanning from Brazil to Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the subtropical and tropical areas of the continent. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along riverbanks. It is also present in parts of Central America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to areas with high humidity and well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea articulata was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been reported in various regions where it has established itself in disturbed soils and open areas. The plant's spread is often associated with its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains localized and not widespread across all regions.</p>
