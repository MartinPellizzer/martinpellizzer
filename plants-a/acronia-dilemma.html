                <h1>Acronia dilemma</h1>
<p>Acronia dilemma, commonly known as the white-flowered acronia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are ovate and hairy, with a rough texture.</p>
<p>Acronia dilemma is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia dilemma has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically 2-5 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to poor soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia dilemma is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This plant is commonly found in areas with high humidity and frequent flooding. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia dilemma was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments where it can thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant spreads primarily through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water. Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to control its spread and protect native plant communities.</p>
