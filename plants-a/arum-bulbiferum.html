<p>Arum bulbiferum, commonly known as the bulbous arum, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a reddish tint along the veins. The plant produces a spadix, a dense cluster of tiny flowers surrounded by a showy, petal-like spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Arum bulbiferum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a popular choice in tropical gardens.</p>
