                <h1>Adenopus pynaertii</h1>
<p>Adenopus pynaertii, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, which are characteristic of the daisy family. Its leaves are usually opposite, elliptical, and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adenopus pynaertii is known for its milky sap, which is often used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenopus pynaertii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green, glossy upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin strips. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopus pynaertii is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded habitats like forests and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Adenopus pynaertii plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopus pynaertii was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates, particularly in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments where there is ample sunlight and consistent moisture. The plant is often found growing near water bodies such as rivers, lakes, and coastal areas. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activities, including horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native flora.</p>
