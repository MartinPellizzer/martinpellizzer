                <h1>Achillea pellati</h1>
<p>Achillea pellati, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for alpine gardens.</p>
<p>Achillea pellati is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pellati has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a gray-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern and measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, herbaceous, and has a smooth, light green bark, growing from the base of the plant. The flowers are composite, consisting of white ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, blooming from June to August and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a achene, with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pellati is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky soils and open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. This plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil conditions. It is often associated with coastal areas and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution spans across several countries in the Mediterranean basin.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pellati was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered a weed in some regions. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in grasslands. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions have contributed to its successful establishment.</p>
<p>However, it can compete with native species and is sometimes regarded as invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
