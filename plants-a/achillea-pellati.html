                <h1>Achillea pellati</h1>
<p>Achillea pellati, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are aromatic, finely divided, and often covered in a silvery coating.</p>
<p>Achillea pellati is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pellati has leaves that are lance-shaped, with a grey-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets and dark brown disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pellati is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, specifically found in parts of southern Europe and north Africa.</p>
<p>While it was historically confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including North America and Australia. This plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and human activities, Achillea pellati is considered to be of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea pellati is a hardy perennial plant known for its bright yellow flowers and drought-resistant nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in early spring and blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between waterings. Fertilization should be light in spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or rosemary enhances its growth and repels pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea pellati is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also attracts other wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds and foliage for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants by attracting beneficial insects. Additionally, its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Achillea pellati also contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and supporting biodiversity in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea pellati is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value and use in landscaping due to its attractive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It has limited culinary applications, as it is not commonly used in food preparation. In traditional medicine, it has been used for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Its presence in gardens and natural habitats contributes to ecological balance and supports pollinators.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is sometimes associated with healing and protection, though it does not hold significant symbolic status in most traditions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
