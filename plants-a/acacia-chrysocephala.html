                    <h1>Acacia chrysocephala</h1>
<p>Acacia chrysocephala, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and clusters of yellow, globular flowers that bloom in winter. The plant produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Acacia chrysocephala is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and charcoal.</p>
