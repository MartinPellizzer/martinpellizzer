                    <h1>Asplenium ruta-muraria var. pseudogermanicum</h1>
<p>Asplenium ruta-muraria var. pseudogermanicum, commonly known as the False Wall-Rue, is a variant of the common rock fern.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found on limestone or calcareous soils. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with small, lance-shaped fronds that are usually dark green. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its distinct leaf morphology and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value.</p>
