                <h1>Adiantum thornei</h1>
<p>Adiantum thornei, commonly known as the Thorne Brake, is a fern species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the Adiantum genus.</p>
<p>Adiantum thornei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum thornei has fern-like leaves that are triangular in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green color and a delicate, feathery texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a branching pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spore-bearing structures, typically blooming in late summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a cluster of sporangia, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum thornei is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as along streams, in wetlands, and in swampy forests. This fern thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained, acidic soils. It is often associated with limestone substrates and can be found in both natural and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Adiantum thornei is an important component of the understory vegetation in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum thornei was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the North Island, particularly in the lower Northland region. The plant thrives in damp, shaded areas such as forest floors and stream banks. It is considered an invasive species in some parts of its range.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native flora.</p>
