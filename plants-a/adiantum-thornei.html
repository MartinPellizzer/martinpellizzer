<p>Adiantum thornei, commonly known as the Thorne Brake, is a fern species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the Adiantum genus.</p>
<p>Adiantum thornei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right conditions.</p>
