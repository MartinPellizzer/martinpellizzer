                <h1>Alexitoxicon boissieri</h1>
<p>Alexitoxicon boissieri, commonly known as the Boissieri's false hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a single umbel. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in rocky and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by herbivores and is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat.</p>
