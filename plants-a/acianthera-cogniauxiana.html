                <h1>Acianthera cogniauxiana</h1>
<p>Acianthera cogniauxiana, commonly known as the Cogniaux's acianthera, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are usually elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom during the warmer months and attract various pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera cogniauxiana has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a light greenish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small and clustered, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that contains small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera cogniauxiana is primarily native to Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Nicaragua, and Panam√°.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the tropical regions of these countries. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the cloud forests. The plant is well adapted to the high humidity and mild temperatures of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches in these Central American and northern South American countries.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera cogniauxiana was mainly introduced to the tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest undergrowth and rocky outcrops. This orchid is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections due to its ornamental value. Its introduction has been largely unintentional through seed dispersal by wind or animals.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in its introduced range.</p>
