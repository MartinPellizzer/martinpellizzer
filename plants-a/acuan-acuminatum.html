                <h1>Acuan acuminatum</h1>
<p>Acuan acuminatum, commonly known as the sharp-pointed acuan, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are elliptical and often have a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>Acuan acuminatum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acuan acuminatum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a pointed tip and a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a light brown bark that becomes rough with age, growing upright with some branching. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with yellow petals and a green calyx, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acuan acuminatum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and humid lowland areas. This plant thrives in warm, moist environments with high humidity. It is often seen growing near the forest floor or in shaded undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific regions within the broader tropical Asian continent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acuan acuminatum was mainly introduced to new areas in Southeast Asia for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it suitable for garden landscapes and traditional herbal use. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and human-modified environments.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
