<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid.</p>
