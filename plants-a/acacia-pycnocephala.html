<p>Acacia pycnocephala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and bipinnate leaves that are narrow and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Acacia pycnocephala is also known for its role in providing habitat and food for various desert animals.</p>
