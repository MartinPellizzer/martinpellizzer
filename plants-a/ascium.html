                    <h1>Ascium</h1>
<p>Ascium, commonly known as the ascus, is a specialized structure found in certain fungi, particularly in the Ascomycota division.</p>
<p>It is a sac-like cell that contains and protects the spores during their development. The ascus is typically formed within a fruiting body called an ascocarp. Spores are released through the opening of the ascus, a process known as ascospore discharge.</p>
<p>The morphology and structure of the ascus vary among different fungal species, reflecting adaptations to their reproductive strategies.</p>
