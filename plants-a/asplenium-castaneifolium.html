<p>Asplenium castaneifolium, commonly known as the chestnut-leaf spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, leathery, and deeply lobed leaves that resemble the shape of a chestnut leaf. This fern typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to surfaces, while its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium castaneifolium is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in woodland ecosystems.</p>
