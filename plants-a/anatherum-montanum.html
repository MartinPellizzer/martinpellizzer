                    <h1>Anatherum montanum</h1>
<p>Anatherum montanum, commonly known as mountain needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Anatherum montanum is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high elevations and poor soil, making it a resilient component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance lies in providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species.</p>
