                    <h1>Adesmia humifusa</h1>
<p>Adesmia humifusa, commonly known as the creeping adesmia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It has small, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Adesmia humifusa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
