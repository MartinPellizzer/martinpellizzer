                <h1>Adesmia humifusa</h1>
<p>Adesmia humifusa, commonly known as the creeping adesmia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It has small, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Adesmia humifusa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia humifusa has small, ovate leaves that are usually hairy and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a size ranging from 1 to 3 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is prostrate, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that grows close to the ground. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white or pale pink petals, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia humifusa is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of northern South America, including parts of Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. This plant is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and low precipitation. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the ecological conditions of the Andean and Amazonian foothills.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia humifusa was mainly introduced to New Zealand as part of ecological restoration efforts.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and dune environments, where it helps stabilize sandy soils. The plant thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions and is often used in revegetation projects. Its introduction has contributed to the recovery of degraded coastal habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential impacts on native flora.</p>
