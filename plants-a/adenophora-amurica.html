                <h1>Adenophora amurica</h1>
<p>Adenophora amurica, commonly known as the Amur bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Adenophora amurica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora amurica has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. The flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in inflorescences, and range in color from white to pale blue, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora amurica is primarily native to Manchuria.</p>
<p>It is found in the temperate regions of this area, which spans parts of China, Russia, and Korea. This plant typically grows in forested areas and along riverbanks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the continental climate of the region.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the natural habitats available in Manchuria.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora amurica was mainly introduced to the northeastern regions of China, particularly in the provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning.</p>
<p>It has also been found in parts of Russia and Korea, where it has established itself in moist, temperate climates. The plant is typically found in forested areas and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its introduction has been largely due to natural dispersal through wind and water, as well as human activities such as horticultural trade.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in its introduced range and remains a relatively benign species.</p>
