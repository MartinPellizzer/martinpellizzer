<p>Adenophora amurica, commonly known as the Amur bellflower, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland areas and has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. It produces showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Adenophora amurica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora amurica has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, growing upright with some branching. The flowers are bell-shaped, with five petals, typically blue to purple in color, blooming from July to August, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora amurica is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia, specifically found in regions of Russia, China, and Korea.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Russian Far East, particularly in Primorsky and Khabarovsk regions, as well as in northeastern China. It thrives in moist, temperate climates, typically growing in forest understories or along stream banks. This plant is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Adenophora amurica is listed as a vulnerable species in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
