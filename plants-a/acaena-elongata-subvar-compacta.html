                        <h1>Acaena elongata subvar. compacta</h1>
<p>Acaena elongata subvar. compacta, commonly known as the dense mat-forming acaena, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, spiny leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, which forms a mat-like structure on the ground. Its fruits are small, hairy achenes that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation.</p>
<p>This species is often found in coastal and subalpine regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
