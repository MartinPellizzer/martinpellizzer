                    <h1>Avena blaui</h1>
<p>Avena blaui, commonly known as blue oatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It features fine, blue-green foliage that turns a striking silver-white in the winter, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers in early summer, which are clustered in panicles. Avena blaui thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it valuable for erosion control and landscaping in arid regions.</p>
