                    <h1>Arabis arenaria</h1>
<p>Arabis arenaria, commonly known as sand sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are adapted to conserve moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically arranged in a raceme. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it a common pioneer species in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Arabis arenaria is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
