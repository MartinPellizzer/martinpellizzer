                    <h1>Acacia westiana</h1>
<p>Acacia westiana, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, feathery leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in hard pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its adaptation to dry environments.</p>
<p>Acacia westiana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
