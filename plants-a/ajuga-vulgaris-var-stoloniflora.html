                    <h1>Ajuga vulgaris var. stoloniflora</h1>
<p>Ajuga vulgaris var. stoloniflora, commonly known as spreading bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in early to mid-summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its stolons allow it to spread rapidly, forming thick ground cover that suppresses weeds and prevents soil erosion.</p>
