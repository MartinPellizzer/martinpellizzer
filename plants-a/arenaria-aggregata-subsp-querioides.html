<p>Arenaria aggregata subsp.</p>
<p>querioides, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of prostrate stems covered with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on short pedicels. Its succulent leaves and compact growth habit make it well adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in sandy soils and is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental plant for its hardy nature and delicate appearance.</p>
