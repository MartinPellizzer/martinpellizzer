                    <h1>Aloe ruvuensis</h1>
<p>Aloe ruvuensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori aloe, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow to orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its root system is adapted to absorb nutrients from poor, rocky soils, allowing it to thrive in mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Aloe ruvuensis is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its potential medicinal properties.</p>
