                    <h1>Azorella biloba var. strigosa</h1>
<p>Azorella biloba var. strigosa, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a hardy perennial belonging to the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of dark green, leathery leaves that form a compact cushion-like structure. This plant is well adapted to harsh environments, such as high-altitude regions and rocky soils, due to its ability to retain moisture and withstand extreme temperatures. Its flowers are small and white, typically arranged in a single umbel at the center of the plant.</p>
<p>Azorella biloba var. strigosa is also notable for its slow growth rate and long lifespan, often living for several decades in its native habitat.</p>
