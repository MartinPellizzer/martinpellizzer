<p>Aechmea chrysocoma, commonly known as the golden rosette bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The leaves are typically bright green with a waxy coating, and the plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant yellow bracts. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Aechmea chrysocoma is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
