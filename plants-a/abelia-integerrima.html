                <h1>Abelia integerrima</h1>
<p>Abelia integerrima, commonly known as the smooth abelia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features upright, slender stems covered in dense, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Abelia integerrima thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a versatile choice for gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant foliage and ability to attract pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abelia integerrima has opposite, elliptical leaves that are medium-sized, ranging from 2 to 4 inches in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, woody, and have a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are clusters of tubular, fragrant blooms in shades of white to pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelia integerrima is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southeastern China, particularly in provinces such as Yunnan and Sichuan.</p>
<p>While it was historically confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including gardens in the United States and Europe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often growing in forest understories. This species typically occurs at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, Abelia integerrima is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abelia integerrima is a hardy, flowering shrub known for its fragrant white to pink blooms and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through softwood cuttings in spring or by dividing the rootstock in early fall. The plant has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity within 2-3 years and blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize with a balanced fertilizer in early spring, and prune after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or conifers can enhance its growth and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
