                <h1>Acrotome tenuis</h1>
<p>Acrotome tenuis, commonly known as the slender acrotome, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in clusters. Its leaves are simple and opposite, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Acrotome tenuis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotome tenuis has small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant grows. Its flowers are simple, white or pale yellow, with four petals and a short, narrow tube, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotome tenuis is primarily native to Zambia.</p>
<p>It is found in various habitats across the country, including grasslands and woodland areas. This plant is commonly observed in the southern and central regions of Zambia. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the local climate.</p>
<p>Acrotome tenuis plays a role in the local ecosystem and is part of the floral diversity in Zambia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotome tenuis was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and gardening.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in regions where it has been cultivated. The plant thrives in temperate climates and can spread rapidly if not controlled. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is not currently classified as a major invasive species in most areas.</p>
