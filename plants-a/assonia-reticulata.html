<p>Assonia reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that often display a combination of white, yellow, and green hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its intricate network of veins on the leaves gives it the common name "net-veined," and it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Assonia reticulata is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
