                    <h1>Anil heterophylla</h1>
<p>Anil heterophylla, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, often inflated leaves that can trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant is a carnivorous species, using its bladder-like structures to capture and digest prey. It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on aquatic plant adaptations and carnivory.</p>
