<p>Argythamnia microphylla, commonly known as the lesser sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches a height of 10â€“30 cm, characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in compact clusters, which bloom in the spring and are followed by bract-like structures. Its leaves are small, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh, dry environments it inhabits.</p>
<p>Argythamnia microphylla is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or disturbed areas.</p>
