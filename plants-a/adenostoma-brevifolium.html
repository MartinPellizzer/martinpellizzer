                <h1>Adenostoma brevifolium</h1>
<p>Adenostoma brevifolium, commonly known as chamise, is a shrub native to California and parts of Nevada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has adapted to dry, sunny environments and is drought-tolerant. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Chamise plays an important role in local ecosystems and is often found in chaparral habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostoma brevifolium has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a grayish-green color and a fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub with a dense, compact form. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through dryness, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping the plant to conserve water in its arid habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostoma brevifolium is primarily native to California and Baja California, United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. This plant thrives in areas with mild, wet winters and dry summers. It is often associated with serpentine soils, which are rich in minerals but low in nutrients.</p>
<p>Adenostoma brevifolium plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostoma brevifolium was mainly introduced to areas with dry, open habitats such as chaparral and coastal sage scrub.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of California and Baja California, where it thrives in well-drained soils. This plant is often associated with disturbed sites and can spread rapidly in these environments. Its introduction has led to changes in local plant communities, sometimes outcompeting native species.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas.</p>
