                <h1>Acer davidii var. grandifolium</h1>
<p>Acer davidii var. grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which can reach up to 20 centimeters in diameter, giving it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its unique foliage and adaptability, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as an ornamental tree in suitable climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer davidii var. grandifolium has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 8â€“12 cm in length; they are bright green in summer and turn vibrant yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes furrowed with age, and it exhibits a straight, upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in catkins, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed enclosed in a dry, two-lobed capsule, which is dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer davidii var. grandifolium is a rare variant of the David's maple native to the mountainous regions of central China, specifically in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in its native range, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and over-collection. This species thrives in cool, moist environments such as mountain forests, typically at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. It is listed as critically endangered due to its restricted habitat and declining population.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve this unique plant species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer davidii var. grandifolium is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its large, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant fall color.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for germination. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, fertile soil and moderate watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer davidii var. grandifolium is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved soil conditions. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the ground in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining habitat diversity, supporting a wide range of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer davidii var. grandifolium is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and flowers may have minor uses in traditional herbal remedies. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to biodiversity and supports wildlife, making it valuable in conservation efforts. Culturally, it is appreciated for its aesthetic appeal in landscaping and garden design.</p>
<p>Symbolically, it represents resilience and beauty in natural environments.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer davidii var. grandifolium has several popular cultivars such as 'Koehneana' and 'Atsumi', which are prized for their large, showy leaves and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, leading to the development of cultivars like 'Crimson King' and 'Emerald Queen' that exhibit enhanced color and growth habits. These hybrids and cultivars are widely used in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions. The plant's unique foliage makes it a valuable addition to landscapes, especially in regions with temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its horticultural importance continues to grow due to its versatility and visual impact in both residential and public gardens.</p>
