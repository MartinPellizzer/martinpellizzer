<p>Austrostipa feresetacea, commonly known as the Western Australian wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern region of Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Austrostipa feresetacea plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local fauna in its native range.</p>
