                    <h1>Achyranthes annua</h1>
<p>Achyranthes annua, commonly known as Chinese knotweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, branching stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, three-lobed seed capsules. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
