                <h1>Achyranthes annua</h1>
<p>Achyranthes annua, commonly known as Chinese knotweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, branching stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, three-lobed seed capsules. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a weed in agricultural settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes annua has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 3–10 cm long and 1–3 cm wide, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside, arranged along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and herbaceous, with a light green to reddish-brown color, and it grows in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in spikes, blooming from July to September, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a shallow network near the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes annua is primarily native to Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina, Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Provinces, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Djibouti, DR Congo, Egypt, Eritrea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, KwaZulu-Natal, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Northern Provinces, Oman, Rwanda, Réunion, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Socotra, Somalia, Sudan-South Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Yemen, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in a wide range of habitats, including arid and semi-arid regions, as well as moist soils in tropical and subtropical areas. It is often seen growing in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields. The species is known for its adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its native distribution spans across much of sub-Saharan Africa and parts of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes annua was mainly introduced to agricultural areas for its use as a forage crop and its ability to suppress weeds.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils near roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks. The plant has become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and high seed production. It is often considered a weed in cultivated lands, competing with crops for nutrients and water.</p>
<p>Its distribution is expanding in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide.</p>
