                <h1>Aconitum lutescens</h1>
<p>Aconitum lutescens, commonly known as the yellow aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with a distinctive hooded structure. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum lutescens has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a bright yellow-green color and a coarse texture.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a dark brown bark that becomes rough as the plant matures, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are showy, blue to violet in color, with five petals and a spurred structure, blooming in summer and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, adapted for anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum lutescens is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of northern India.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This species is adapted to cold climates and is commonly found at elevations above 2,000 meters. It is also present in regions of the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and localized in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum lutescens was mainly introduced to gardens and cultivated areas for its ornamental value, particularly its showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It is often grown as a decorative plant in temperate climates due to its striking appearance. Despite its beauty, it is highly toxic and should be handled with care. The plant is native to Central Asia but has been cultivated in various parts of the world.</p>
<p>Its introduction has sometimes led to its escape into the wild, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
