                <h1>Adina malaccensis</h1>
<p>Adina malaccensis, commonly known as the Malacca adina, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, spherical berries. Adina malaccensis is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Its growth habit and foliage make it a popular choice for horticultural use in tropical regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina malaccensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small white flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming from July to September, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a fleshy drupe, dispersing its seeds through animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, anchoring the plant firmly in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina malaccensis is primarily native to Malaya, Thailand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical regions of these areas. The plant thrives in humid and warm climates, often growing in forested areas. It is known for its aromatic leaves and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely confined to the southern parts of Thailand and the Malay Peninsula.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina malaccensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland forests and along riverbanks, often growing as an understory plant. The species has also been introduced to parts of the Pacific Islands and the Caribbean, where it has established itself in disturbed habitats. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, Adina malaccensis is now considered a cosmopolitan species in many regions outside its native range.</p>
