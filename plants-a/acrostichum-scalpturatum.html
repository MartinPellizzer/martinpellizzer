                <h1>Acrostichum scalpturatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum scalpturatum, commonly known as the scarlet fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bright red fronds that contrast sharply with its dark, leathery texture. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its fronds are compound, with a unique arrangement of pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Acrostichum scalpturatum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum scalpturatum has large, compound leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, and can grow up to 3 meters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a light brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a dark brown, three-winged samara that disperses its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum scalpturatum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and high rainfall. This plant is commonly found in swampy or seasonally flooded habitats. It is also present in parts of the Caribbean, including the islands of the Greater and Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>Its distribution extends into some regions of southern Florida in the United States.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum scalpturatum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as landscaping and horticultural trade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This plant has become established in several areas outside its native range, often outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and adaptability contribute to its spread in these new locations.</p>
<p>However, it is not currently considered invasive in most regions where it has been introduced.</p>
