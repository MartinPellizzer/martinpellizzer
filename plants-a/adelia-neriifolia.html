                <h1>Adelia neriifolia</h1>
<p>Adelia neriifolia, commonly known as the white-leafed acacia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom throughout the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and seasonal floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia neriifolia has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, with a tubular structure that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies through nectar. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia neriifolia is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat consists of moist, shaded areas within dense forest understories. While it was once found in specific regions of eastern Madagascar, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss. It typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and threats from deforestation, Adelia neriifolia is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adelia neriifolia is a hardy shrub known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining desirable traits. The plant has a moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within two to three years, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and promote healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is relatively pest and disease resistant but may occasionally face issues with aphids or root rot, making companion planting with marigolds or lavender beneficial for natural pest control.</p>
