                <h1>Adelia neriifolia</h1>
<p>Adelia neriifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf or black willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by round, woody fruits containing several seeds. Adelia neriifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near waterways.</p>
<p>It plays a role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia neriifolia has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a pale brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, featuring white petals with a yellow center, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia neriifolia is primarily native to the eastern coast of Australia, specifically Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal heathlands and sandy soils along the shoreline. This plant thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often associated with dune systems. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic inundation from tidal waters.</p>
<p>Adelia neriifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia neriifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It is often found growing in coastal areas and on sandy soils.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited and it does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems.</p>
