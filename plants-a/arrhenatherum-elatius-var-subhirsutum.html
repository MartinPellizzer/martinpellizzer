                    <h1>Arrhenatherum elatius var. subhirsutum</h1>
<p>Arrhenatherum elatius var. subhirsutum, commonly known as the hairy meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained to slightly waterlogged soils. The plant features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its "hairy" appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which are usually green to brown in color.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting insect and bird populations.</p>
