                    <h1>Aloe cheranganiensis</h1>
<p>Aloe cheranganiensis, commonly known as the Kenyan aloe, is a species native to East Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stem and large, fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating. The plant produces striking orange-red flowers that bloom at the top of the stem, typically in late summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
