                <h1>Achillea × polyphylla</h1>
<p>Achillea × polyphylla, commonly known as the yarrow hybrid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, flat-topped clusters of small, usually white or pale yellow flowers. The plant features basal leaves that are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and its stems are usually upright and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Achillea × polyphylla is also valued for its historical use in herbal medicine and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × polyphylla has basal to erect leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a grayish-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged in a rosette at the base and gradually becoming alternate higher up the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age, growing upright with a somewhat branching pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are lightweight, allowing them to travel considerable distances.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × polyphylla is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Russia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other areas, particularly in Europe and North America, where it is now found in gardens and cultivated landscapes. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. It typically grows at elevations between 1,000 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Achillea × polyphylla is not considered a threatened species, but its introduction to non-native areas can sometimes lead to ecological concerns.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea × polyphylla is a hardy perennial known for its vibrant, flat-topped flower heads and drought-resistant nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a long growth cycle, blooming from early summer to late fall, with a dormant period in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, preferring full sun to partial shade. Regular fertilization in spring and pruning after flowering promote dense growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow enhances its ornamental appeal and benefits from their shared preference for dry, sunny environments.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea × polyphylla is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, which contribute to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it effective in stabilizing slopes and preventing land degradation.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers shelter and habitat for small insects and invertebrates, supporting a healthy and balanced ecological environment.</p>
