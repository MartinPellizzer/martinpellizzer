<p>Arachniodes hekiana, commonly known as the Hekian fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Arachniodes hekiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
