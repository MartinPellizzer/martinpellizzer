                <h1>Acinodendron lacerum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron lacerum, commonly known as the rock fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its fruit is a small, round, fleshy berry that turns red when mature.</p>
<p>Acinodendron lacerum is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron lacerum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron lacerum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas within these regions. The plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is often associated with riverine and coastal ecosystems. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, particularly in the Philippines and Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these geographic areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron lacerum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high sunlight exposure and moderate to high rainfall. The plant is often found in secondary forests, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields where competition from native vegetation is low. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems remains largely undocumented.</p>
