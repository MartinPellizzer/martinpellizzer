                        <h1>Acacia heteroneura</h1>
<p>Acacia heteroneura, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, narrow leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that appear in late winter to early spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its seed pods are elongated and woody, containing several seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Acacia heteroneura is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of native Australian flora.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia heteroneura belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises vascular plants with a diverse range of forms, including ferns and flowering plants. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species such as roses and magnolias.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have compound leaves and flowers with a specific structure. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume family, which is recognized for its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive phyllodes and ability to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia heteroneura, a specific type of acacia found in certain regions of Australia, characterized by its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia heteroneura is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the state. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the southwestern and central parts of Western Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia heteroneura was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the North Island, where it thrives in coastal and urban environments. The plant's rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas have led to its classification as an invasive species in some parts of the country. Despite its ecological impacts, it remains popular in horticulture for its drought tolerance and aesthetic value.</p>
<p>Management efforts focus on controlling its spread to protect native ecosystems.</p>
