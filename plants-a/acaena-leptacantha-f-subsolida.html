                    <h1>Acaena leptacantha f. subsolida</h1>
<p>Acaena leptacantha f. subsolida, commonly known as the slender hooked burr, is a variant of the Acaena genus native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces distinctive, hooked bracts that enclose its tiny, dark berries, which are adapted for animal dispersal. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in coastal and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
