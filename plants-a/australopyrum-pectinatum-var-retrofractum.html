                    <h1>Australopyrum pectinatum var. retrofractum</h1>
<p>Australopyrum pectinatum var. retrofractum, commonly known as the southern frond fern, is a unique variant of the genus Australopyrum native to the temperate regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive frond structure, with long, pinnately divided leaves that exhibit a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are clustered in spore-bearing cones, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>The varietal name "retrofractum" refers to the backward-bending nature of its leaf segments, a feature that aids in distinguishing it from other similar species.</p>
