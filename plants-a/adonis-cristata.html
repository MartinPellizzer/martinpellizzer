                <h1>Adonis cristata</h1>
<p>Adonis cristata, commonly known as the crested lark's foot, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a rosette of basal leaves and produces striking yellow flowers with prominent, crested stamens. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, preferring sunny exposures. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Adonis cristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis cristata has leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are yellow, with a distinctive crown-like structure, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis cristata is primarily native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Mediterranean, including parts of Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel.</p>
<p>It is also found in the Caucasus region, extending into northern Iran and Armenia. This plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. It is commonly associated with open slopes and grasslands in these areas.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis cristata was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, often in mountainous or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with a temperate climate, particularly in the Mediterranean Basin and parts of southern Europe. The plant thrives in dry, open environments and is often associated with limestone or gravelly soils. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to gardens and parks in various parts of the world.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
