                        <h1>Acalypha microgyna</h1>
<p>Acalypha microgyna, commonly known as the little leaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha microgyna is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to human activity, as it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha microgyna was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there during the late 19th or early 20th century by horticulturalists seeking exotic plants for garden landscapes. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and spreads rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native ornamental species.</p>
