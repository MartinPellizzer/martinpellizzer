                    <h1>Amyema pustulata</h1>
<p>Amyema pustulata, commonly known as the pustulate lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright green to yellowish thallus, which is covered in small, rounded pustules. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide photosynthetic energy. It is typically found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and unique morphology make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
