<p>Acacia langlassei, commonly known as the Langlasse's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures in mature plants. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact spherical or cylindrical inflorescences, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Acacia langlassei is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with deep root systems and a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>It is also known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat.</p>
