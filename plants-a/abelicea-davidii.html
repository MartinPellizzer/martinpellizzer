                <h1>Abelicea davidii</h1>
<p>Abelicea davidii, commonly known as the David's abelicea, is a species of flowering plant native to the island of Madeira.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>Abelicea davidii is often found growing in shaded, moist environments within forested areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abelicea davidii has leaves that are simple, alternate, and ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelicea davidii is a flowering plant native to the island of SÃ£o Miguel in the Azores, Portugal.</p>
<p>While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to a few isolated locations on the island. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within laurel forests, typically found in the understory of montane ecosystems. Abelicea davidii grows at elevations between 400 and 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abelicea davidii is a unique and resilient plant known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter offering faster and more reliable results. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 2-3 years, making it ideal for long-term landscaping.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Abelicea davidii is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of the local ecosystem. This plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil and supporting the growth of other plants. Its dense growth also helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape.</p>
<p>Overall, Abelicea davidii plays a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance and biodiversity in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
