<p>Arenaria aggregata subsp.</p>
<p>tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly sandparsley, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots enable it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well-adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
