                <h1>Adinandra auriformis</h1>
<p>Adinandra auriformis, commonly known as the golden leaf tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often yellowish-green in color. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Adinandra auriformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some indigenous communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra auriformis has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring between 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a straight, upright manner. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellow petals and stamens, blooming during the dry season and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra auriformis is primarily native to China Southeast.</p>
<p>This species is found in the southern regions of China, particularly in the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. It thrives in tropical and subtropical forest environments. The plant is commonly associated with moist, well-drained soils in lowland and hill areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within this geographic region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra auriformis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and secondary forests. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and can tolerate a range of environmental conditions. Its introduction has led to its establishment in many areas outside its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
