<p>Acalypha phleoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chaffflower, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often spiny flora. The plant is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Acalypha phleoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha phleoides has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, erect, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. It produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers with four to five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha phleoides is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries like Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Indonesia and the Philippines, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. This species prefers moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and wetlands. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 50 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Acalypha phleoides is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, but its habitat is under threat due to deforestation and land conversion.</p>
