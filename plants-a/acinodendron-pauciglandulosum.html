                <h1>Acinodendron pauciglandulosum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron pauciglandulosum, commonly known as the sparse-glandular acinodendron, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant features small, elliptical leaves with a glossy green surface and sparse glandular dots on the underside. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and are arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact form and attractive foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron pauciglandulosum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly pubescent, with a light brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant ages. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron pauciglandulosum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland forests and is commonly found in areas with rich biodiversity. This plant is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats within its native range. It is not widely distributed beyond these regions and is considered endemic to parts of the Malay Archipelago.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range, it is not commonly cultivated outside its native environment.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron pauciglandulosum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and full sun exposure. The plant is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including land clearing and urban development.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in agricultural and natural landscapes.</p>
