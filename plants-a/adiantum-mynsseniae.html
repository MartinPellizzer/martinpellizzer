                    <h1>Adiantum mynsseniae</h1>
<p>Adiantum mynsseniae, commonly known as the Mysore maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble a maidenhair. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Adiantum mynsseniae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
