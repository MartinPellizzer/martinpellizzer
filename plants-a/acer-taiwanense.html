                <h1>Acer taiwanense</h1>
<p>Acer taiwanense, commonly known as the Taiwan maple, is a deciduous tree native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and prefers well-drained soils in temperate climates. Its samaras, or winged seeds, are dispersed by wind, aiding in its natural propagation.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer taiwanense has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two wings, dispersing by wind, and the seeds are small and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and moderately deep, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer taiwanense is a rare maple species native to Taiwan, specifically found in the central and eastern mountain ranges.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited to Taiwan, it is now also cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation centers outside its original habitat. This plant thrives in humid, subtropical environments with well-drained soil, typically growing in shaded to semi-shaded forest areas. It is commonly found at altitudes between 1,500 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, Acer taiwanense is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer taiwanense is a deciduous tree native to Taiwan, known for its ornamental value and unique leaf patterns.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for optimal germination. The growth cycle includes a dormant period in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or groundcovers can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support biodiversity in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer taiwanense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree also acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of nearby flora by improving soil conditions. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer taiwanense plays a vital ecological role in maintaining the balance of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer taiwanense is a species of maple native to Taiwan, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In industrial contexts, its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain, making it suitable for crafting and furniture. Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty in Taiwanese landscapes, often featured in local art and botanic gardens.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting local biodiversity also highlights its importance in ecological conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer taiwanense has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Variegatum' and 'Pendulum', which are known for their unique foliage patterns and weeping growth habits. Hybrids of Acer taiwanense are often created with other maple species to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and bloom time. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden settings.</p>
<p>They are widely used in landscaping and as specimen trees in temperate climates.</p>
