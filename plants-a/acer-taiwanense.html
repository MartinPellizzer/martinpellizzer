                <h1>Acer taiwanense</h1>
<p>Acer taiwanense, commonly known as the Taiwan maple, is a deciduous tree native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and urban landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer taiwanense has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, turning bright red or orange in the autumn. The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed that is dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer taiwanense is a species of maple native to Taiwan, specifically found in the central and southern regions of the island.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely confined to its native range, with limited cultivation outside of Taiwan. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas, often growing in mixed hardwood forests. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acer taiwanense is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer taiwanense is a deciduous tree native to Taiwan, known for its ornamental value and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed or hardwood cuttings, with seed propagation requiring stratification to break dormancy. The growth cycle of Acer taiwanense includes a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with appropriate organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer taiwanense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting the local ecosystem's reproductive processes. The tree also acts as a companion plant, enhancing soil health and promoting the growth of neighboring flora. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and protecting against water runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer taiwanense plays a role in carbon sequestration, aiding in the mitigation of climate change impacts.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
