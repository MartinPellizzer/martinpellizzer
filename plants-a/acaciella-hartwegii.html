                    <h1>Acaciella hartwegii</h1>
<p>Acaciella hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant features small, bipinnate leaves and produces yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in hard pods, and the plant is adapted to survive in dry, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Acaciella hartwegii plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat in its native ecosystems.</p>
