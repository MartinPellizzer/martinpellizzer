                <h1>Adinandra dubia</h1>
<p>Adinandra dubia, commonly known as the African star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its attractive, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are typically opposite, simple, and have a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>Adinandra dubia is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and is found in various habitats including forests and shrublands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra dubia has simple, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra dubia is primarily native to Sumatera.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this island, which is part of Indonesia. The plant thrives in humid and shaded environments within the primary forest canopy. It is commonly encountered in the lowland and montane regions of Sumatera.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its distribution is becoming increasingly restricted.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra dubia was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and secondary vegetation, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high humidity and moderate to high rainfall. This plant is often found in forest edges, clearings, and along roadsides where sunlight penetration is increased. Its introduction has been noted in several Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains largely unstudied in most regions.</p>
