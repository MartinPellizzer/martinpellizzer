<p>Amorphophallus commutatus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant produces showy, white flowers that resemble those of orchids, which bloom at night and emit a strong odor to attract pollinators.
