                    <h1>Allium decipiens</h1>
<p>Allium decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive onion, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are often mistaken for true onions due to their similar appearance, hence the common name.</p>
<p>Allium decipiens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes grown in gardens for its visual interest.</p>
