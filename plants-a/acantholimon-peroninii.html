<p>Acantholimon peroninii, commonly known as the Peron's thornstep, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with erect, branched stems and small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often found in coastal dunes and inland shrublands.</p>
