                <h1>Actinodaphne quinqueflora</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne quinqueflora, commonly known as the five-flowered laurel, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are typically followed by dark purple, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and medicinal properties make it a notable species in botanical gardens and traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne quinqueflora has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 12 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it exhibits a vertical growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white in color, with a simple structure consisting of three sepals and three petals, and they bloom from June to August, likely pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne quinqueflora is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland tropical forests and hillside areas. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often associated with secondary forests and can be found in both primary and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution extends into parts of India and the Andaman Islands as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne quinqueflora was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil, making it suitable for cultivation in areas with warm temperatures and ample rainfall. The plant is often grown as an ornamental species due to its fragrant leaves and attractive appearance. It has been introduced to several island nations, including Hawaii and parts of the Philippines, where it has established populations in the wild.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
