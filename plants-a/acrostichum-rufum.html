                <h1>Acrostichum rufum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum rufum, commonly known as the red fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery fronds that are typically reddish in color, especially when young. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum rufum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum rufum has large, feather-like leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged in a pinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and upright, with a rough, fibrous bark that is typically brown in color. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a dark red drupe that contains one or two seeds, which are dispersed by birds consuming the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively through underground stems.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum rufum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of the Caribbean, Central America, and northern South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. This fern is commonly found in lowland areas with high humidity and consistent rainfall. It is particularly prevalent in countries like Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to its preference for warm, humid climates and its ability to grow in nutrient-rich soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum rufum was mainly introduced to wetland and riparian areas where it can thrive in moist, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is often found along riverbanks, lakeshores, and other aquatic environments. This plant is known for its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>However, it can also become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
