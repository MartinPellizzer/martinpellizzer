                    <h1>Amblirion album</h1>
<p>Amblirion album, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a rare and delicate plant characterized by its silvery-white fronds that shimmer under sunlight.</p>
<p>It is native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity. The plant's leaves are elongated and feather-like, with a unique arrangement that allows for efficient light absorption. Its flowers, though small, are pale yellow and appear in clusters, adding to its ethereal appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, Amblirion album is considered a conservation concern.</p>
