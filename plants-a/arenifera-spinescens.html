<p>Arenifera spinescens, commonly known as the desert spiny plant, is a succulent species adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, spiny leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, adding a vibrant touch to its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Arenifera spinescens is often found in sandy soils of desert regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
