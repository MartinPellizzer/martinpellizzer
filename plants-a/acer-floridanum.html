<p>Acer floridanum, commonly known as the Florida maple, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged seeds. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in wetlands.</p>
<p>The Florida maple is relatively rare and is considered a valuable species for ecological studies due to its unique habitat requirements.</p>
