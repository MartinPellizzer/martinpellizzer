                        <h1>Acer ceriferum</h1>
<p>Acer ceriferum, commonly known as the sugar maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming more rugged with age.</p>
<p>Acer ceriferum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also important for timber and ecological habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer ceriferum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is commonly found in forested areas at higher elevations. This species is particularly associated with the Himalayan foothills and the eastern part of the Tibetan Plateau. It is often seen growing in mixed deciduous forests and along streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer ceriferum was mainly introduced to the western United States as an ornamental tree due to its striking red foliage in the fall.</p>
<p>It has been widely planted in urban and suburban landscapes for its aesthetic value and adaptability to various soil conditions. However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native plant species in certain regions. Despite its popularity, it is not commonly found in the eastern part of the country.</p>
<p>The plant's distribution is primarily limited to areas with mild winters and well-drained soils.</p>
