                <h1>Acer ceriferum</h1>
<p>Acer ceriferum, commonly known as the sugar maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming more rugged with age.</p>
<p>Acer ceriferum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also important for timber and ecological habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer ceriferum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight, upright growth pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in clusters during early spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer ceriferum is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>While it was historically confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including North America and Europe, as an ornamental plant. It thrives in temperate climates with cool summers and cold winters, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. This species is found at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its natural habitat faces threats from deforestation and habitat fragmentation, leading to a vulnerable conservation status.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer ceriferum is a fast-growing maple tree known for its striking red foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer ceriferum involves rapid growth in the first few years, followed by slower development as it matures.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are recommended for optimal health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer ceriferum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring blossoms. Its extensive root system acts as an effective erosion control plant, stabilizing soil along riverbanks and slopes. The tree also serves as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a range of ecological interactions.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality through photosynthesis.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer ceriferum is a species of maple tree known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its sap can be tapped for syrup in certain regions. In traditional medicine, various parts of the tree have been used to treat ailments such as inflammation and respiratory issues. Industrially, its wood is valued for its durability and is used in furniture and construction.</p>
<p>Culturally, the tree symbolizes resilience and growth, often featured in local art and landscaping.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer ceriferum has several popular cultivars such as 'Autumn Flame' and 'Red Sunset', which are prized for their vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>It also has hybrids like Acer ceriferum Ã— Acer griseum, which combine the ornamental qualities of both parent species. These varieties are valued for their striking color changes in fall, making them popular choices in horticulture. Their adaptability to various climates enhances their appeal among gardeners and landscapers.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer ceriferum and its cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their aesthetic value and ecological benefits.</p>
