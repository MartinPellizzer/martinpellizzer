                    <h1>Acacia impervia</h1>
<p>Acacia impervia, commonly known as the desert acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. Acacia impervia is well-suited to harsh environments due to its deep root system and ability to fix nitrogen.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
