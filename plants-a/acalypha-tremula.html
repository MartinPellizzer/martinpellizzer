<p>Acalypha tremula, commonly known as the trembling cupplant, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by distinctive, lantern-shaped seed pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Acalypha tremula is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha tremula has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and consist of five pink or red petals, blooming from summer to fall, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in the plant's ability to thrive in moist, disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha tremula is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is now also distributed in parts of Oceania, including Australia and New Guinea, where it has been introduced. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forests or along riverbanks. It is typically found at low to mid-altitudes, ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Acalypha tremula is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status due to its adaptability and wide distribution.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha tremula is a fast-growing, ornamental shrub known for its vibrant foliage and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method for quick results. The growth cycle of Acalypha tremula is typically seasonal, with rapid growth during spring and summer, followed by a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourages new shoots. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while diseases like root rot can occur if soil conditions are not optimal.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's biodiversity.</p>
