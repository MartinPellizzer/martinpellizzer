                    <h1>Arnica montana</h1>
<p>Arnica montana, commonly known as mountain arnica, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Siberia.</p>
<p>It features a stout, hairy stem that grows up to 30 cm tall, bearing yellow-orange flowers arranged in a spike. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces, and its rhizomatous root system helps it thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Arnica montana is known for its medicinal properties, particularly for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects.</p>
<p>However, it is toxic if ingested and should be used with caution.</p>
