                    <h1>Alomia regnellii</h1>
<p>Alomia regnellii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and small, elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by dark, leathery fruits containing winged seeds. Alomia regnellii is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is highly sought after in traditional crafts and furniture making.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as an endangered species.</p>
