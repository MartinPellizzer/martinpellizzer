                <h1>Acroglyphe hispidula</h1>
<p>Acroglyphe hispidula, commonly known as the hairy acroglyphe, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and often divided, compound leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and thrives in full sun, exhibiting a low, spreading growth habit. Its small, white or greenish flowers appear in umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps.</p>
<p>Acroglyphe hispidula is adapted to withstand drought and heat, making it a resilient species in harsh environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acroglyphe hispidula has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that develops fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are small and clustered, featuring five pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroglyphe hispidula is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly in regions of Georgia, Florida, and Alabama.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal dunes and maritime hammocks. This plant is adapted to coastal environments and is often associated with salt-tolerant vegetation. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune systems and supporting local wildlife.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within the southeastern coastal plain.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroglyphe hispidula was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and moderate moisture levels. The plant is often found in regions with a temperate climate and well-drained soil. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including land development and transportation.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in many parts of its introduced range.</p>
