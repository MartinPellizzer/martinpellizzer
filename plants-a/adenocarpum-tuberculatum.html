                <h1>Adenocarpum tuberculatum</h1>
<p>Adenocarpum tuberculatum, commonly known as the roughhead corymbia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhamnaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Australia and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant features distinctive tuberculate (knob-like) structures on its stems, which give it its specific epithet. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered with fine hairs.</p>
<p>Adenocarpum tuberculatum is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocarpum tuberculatum has leaves that are alternate, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age, growing upright with branching patterns. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpum tuberculatum is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa, Namibia, and parts of Botswana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grassland and rocky habitats, often growing in areas with well-drained soils. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a resilient plant in these environments. It is typically found in open vegetation types such as savannas and shrublands.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its native range by providing food and habitat for various local wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocarpum tuberculatum was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the country in the late 19th century by European settlers who were interested in cultivating exotic plants. Despite its ornamental value, it has since become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. Its spread has been facilitated by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its prolific seed production.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now underway to control its spread and protect native biodiversity.</p>
