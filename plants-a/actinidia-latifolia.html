<p>Actinidia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf actinidia, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Actinidiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically broad and have a smooth texture, contributing to its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia latifolia has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 12 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and they exhibit a climbing or shrub-like growth pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with five sepals and five petals, blooming in early spring, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a yellowish-green berry that matures to a bright red color, containing small, black seeds, and it is dispersed primarily by birds and mammals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant, often growing horizontally just below the soil surface.</p>

<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. It is well adapted to the humid climate and diverse ecosystems of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution spans across Southeast Asia and parts of southern China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia latifolia was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in forested regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated for its edible fruits, which are similar to kiwifruit. The plant thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires consistent moisture. It is valued for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and berries.</p>
