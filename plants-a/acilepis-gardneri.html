                <h1>Acilepis gardneri</h1>
<p>Acilepis gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides habitat for various desert species.</p>
<p>Its seeds are often dispersed by animals, contributing to its survival in harsh environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis gardneri has leaves that are simple, ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a smooth upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring months and relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis gardneri is primarily native to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the island, particularly in forested areas. The plant thrives in humid and shaded environments. It is commonly associated with secondary growth forests and is not widely distributed beyond Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat is limited to specific ecological niches within the country.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis gardneri was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond its original cultivation areas, establishing itself in natural habitats along coastal and riverine zones. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils have contributed to its invasive potential in some regions. It is often found in open woodlands, grasslands, and urban landscapes where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its ecological impact.</p>
