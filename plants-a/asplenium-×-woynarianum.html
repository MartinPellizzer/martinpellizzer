                    <h1>Asplenium × woynarianum</h1>
<p>Asplenium × woynarianum, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a dark green to blackish hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Asplenium × woynarianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
