                    <h1>Astragalus stridii</h1>
<p>Astragalus stridii, commonly known as the rough milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor and drought-prone environments. Astragalus stridii is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
<p>This makes it an important plant in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
