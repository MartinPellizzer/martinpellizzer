                        <h1>Acanthocereus horridus</h1>
<p>Acanthocereus horridus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cacti species native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus with thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its spines are sharp and often covered in a fine, white coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to desert conditions and requires minimal water once established.</p>
