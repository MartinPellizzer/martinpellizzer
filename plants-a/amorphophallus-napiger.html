                    <h1>Amorphophallus napiger</h1>
<p>Amorphophallus napiger, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, which float on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant produces strikingly large, white flowers that bloom at night, emitting a strong odor reminiscent of rotting meat to attract pollinators. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store nutrients and survive in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration.</p>
