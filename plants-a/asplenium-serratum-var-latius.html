<p>Asplenium serratum var. latius, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern characterized by its broader, more robust leaves.</p>
<p>It is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The fronds are finely divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance that gives it a graceful look. It produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which release spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions.</p>
