                    <h1>Aloe mitriformis</h1>
<p>Aloe mitriformis, commonly known as the helmet aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellowish-green flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rosette growth habit and ability to store water in its leaves make it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Aloe mitriformis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
