<p>Acacia myaingii, commonly known as the African silver acacia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, spreading crown and long, straight branches that often form a dense canopy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in compact, globular inflorescences, which are a key feature of the Acacia genus. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous tiny leaflets, and the plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia myaingii is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat.</p>
