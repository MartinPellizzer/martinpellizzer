<p>Acacia drummondii var. typica, commonly known as the Drummond's wattle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces yellow globular inflorescences, which consist of numerous small, pea-like flowers. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>The species is often used in revegetation projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife.</p>
