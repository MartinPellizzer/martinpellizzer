<p>Alexitoxicon rossicum, commonly known as the Rossian poisonflower, is a rare and toxic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant contains several potent alkaloids, which make it highly dangerous if ingested. Its botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and a woody stem that bears clusters of small, fragrant blooms.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is rarely cultivated and is of interest primarily to botanists and toxicologists.</p>
