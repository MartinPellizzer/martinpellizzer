                    <h1>Alnus crispa var. mollis</h1>
<p>Alnus crispa var. mollis, commonly known as the soft-leaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely textured, silvery-gray leaves that are soft to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or near streams.</p>
<p>Alnus crispa var. mollis also has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment.</p>
