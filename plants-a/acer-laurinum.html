                <h1>Acer laurinum</h1>
<p>Acer laurinum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ornamental foliage, which displays a range of colors from bright green to deep red during the growing season. The plant has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are typically bright green in spring and turn vibrant red or orange in autumn. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit.</p>
<p>Acer laurinum thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, moist soil.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer laurinum has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 3–6 inches long and 1–2 inches wide, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface and lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a light gray bark that becomes rougher and darker with age, and it grows upright with a spreading habit. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in upright panicles, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a two-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are tiny and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer laurinum is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States, specifically found in parts of New York, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.</p>
<p>While it was originally restricted to its native range, it is now cultivated in gardens and parks across much of Europe and North America. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in shady to partially sunny environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This species typically grows at altitudes between 300 and 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, Acer laurinum is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, though its wild populations are relatively rare and require protection.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer laurinum is a small, ornamental tree known for its dense foliage and delicate white flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining the desired characteristics. The growth cycle of Acer laurinum includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and annual pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for its health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally suffer from aphids or leaf spot, and it pairs well with companion plants like azaleas and rhododendrons.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer laurinum is a small deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers, which bloom in the spring. The tree also acts as a companion plant in woodland ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil health. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a range of insect and animal life throughout the year.</p>
