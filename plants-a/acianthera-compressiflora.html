                <h1>Acianthera compressiflora</h1>
<p>Acianthera compressiflora, commonly known as the compact-flowered orchid, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant features a short, stocky rhizome and produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in a dense inflorescence. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its unique floral structure and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera compressiflora has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. The flowers are small, tubular, and pale pink to white in color, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant anchor itself in nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera compressiflora is primarily native to Brazil, specifically the states of Pará, Maranhão, and Piauí.</p>
<p>It is found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which is one of the most biodiverse and threatened ecosystems in the world. This orchid typically grows in humid, shaded areas within the undergrowth of tropical rainforests. It is often associated with rocky soils and is commonly found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera compressiflora was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides, gardens, and urban environments. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often spreading rapidly due to its ability to produce numerous seeds. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several non-native locations, sometimes becoming invasive.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it can outcompete native species and alter local ecosystems.</p>
