                    <h1>Arcion tomentosum</h1>
<p>Arcion tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is typically found in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, and it is known for its ability to trap small aquatic organisms in its bladder-like structures.</p>
<p>Arcion tomentosum plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems but is an interesting example of a carnivorous plant adapted to nutrient-poor environments.</p>
