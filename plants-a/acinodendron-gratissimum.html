                <h1>Acinodendron gratissimum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron gratissimum, commonly known as the sweet acacia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Its seeds are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food for local wildlife.</p>
<p>The tree can grow up to 10 meters tall and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron gratissimum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron gratissimum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and moist lowland areas. This species thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is often associated with secondary growth forests. It is also present in some parts of India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>The plant is typically found at elevations below 1,000 meters.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron gratissimum was mainly introduced to enhance biodiversity in tropical and subtropical regions through horticultural and ecological restoration efforts.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high rainfall and well-drained soils, making it suitable for reforestation projects. The plant is valued for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments. Its introduction has also been linked to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive leaves.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent potential ecological imbalances in native ecosystems.</p>
