                    <h1>Allocarya microcalyx</h1>
<p>Allocarya microcalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a small flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Allocarya microcalyx plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats.</p>
