                    <h1>Acianthera rodrigoi</h1>
<p>Acianthera rodrigoi, commonly known as the Rodrigues orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its small, strap-like leaves and unique floral structure make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
