                <h1>Adiantum hemsleyanum</h1>
<p>Adiantum hemsleyanum, commonly known as the Hemsley's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the high altitudes of southern China and northern Vietnam.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and prefers partial shade, making it suitable for shaded garden areas or indoor cultivation. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a rosette of sterile fronds that enclose the fertile fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum hemsleyanum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its elegant, fern-like appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum hemsleyanum has delicate, fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a slender, arching growth habit.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically light green, with a finely toothed margin and a slender, wiry petiole. The plant lacks true stems and bark, instead having a creeping rhizome that anchors it to the substrate. It does not produce showy flowers, as it is a spore-bearing plant rather than a flowering plant.</p>
<p>Its spores are dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum hemsleyanum is primarily native to the eastern Himalayas, including regions in India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky stream banks. This fern is commonly found at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It is often associated with limestone substrates and is part of the rich biodiversity of the Himalayan region.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and localized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum hemsleyanum was mainly introduced to regions with humid climates and shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, rocky soils and along stream banks. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its delicate, lace-like fronds. It has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
