<p>Arrhenatherum elatius var. cylindricum, commonly known as the cylindrical false oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets that are typically arranged in dense, ascending clusters. The plant prefers moist, often calcareous soils and is commonly found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer.</p>
