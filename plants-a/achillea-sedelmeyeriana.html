                <h1>Achillea sedelmeyeriana</h1>
<p>Achillea sedelmeyeriana, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowering display.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its traditional medicinal uses in some cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea sedelmeyeriana has basal, fern-like leaves that are slender, linear to lanceolate in shape, with a silvery-blue underside and a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. The flowers are small, yellowish-white composite heads arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sedelmeyeriana is primarily native to the Transcaucasus.</p>
<p>This region encompasses parts of modern-day Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia. The plant is typically found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. It thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sedelmeyeriana was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silver foliage and fluffy flower heads.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscapes in regions with mild climates, such as California and the Pacific Northwest. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has shown potential to become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to a variety of growing conditions.</p>
<p>However, its spread is often limited by seasonal weather patterns and human intervention.</p>
