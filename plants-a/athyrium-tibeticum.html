                    <h1>Athyrium tibeticum</h1>
<p>Athyrium tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan Athyrium, is a fern native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a rosette of sterile fronds that help in water retention.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its alpine habitat.</p>
