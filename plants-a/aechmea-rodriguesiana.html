                <h1>Aechmea rodriguesiana</h1>
<p>Aechmea rodriguesiana, commonly known as the Rodrigues pineapple, is a striking bromeliad native to the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The plant produces an inflorescence that bears striking red and yellow flowers, adding a vibrant touch to its appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its unique structure and colorful blooms make it a popular choice for both ornamental and ecological purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea rodriguesiana has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, leathery, and dark green, arranged in a compact spiral around the central axis.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, with the leaves forming a tight rosette that holds water, and the base of the plant has a thick, spongy structure resembling a pseudobark. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, with small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in rocky or poor soil environments.</p>
