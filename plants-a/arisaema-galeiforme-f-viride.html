<p>Arisaema galeiforme f. viride, commonly known as the Green-veined Snake-root, is a variant of the Arisaema genus native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, arrow-shaped leaves with prominent green veins contrasting against the dark green foliage. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
