<p>Abies grandis var. idahoensis, commonly known as the Idaho white fir, is a variant of the grand fir native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, conical shape and silver-blue needles that are longer than those of the typical grand fir. The tree produces cones that are typically 5 to 8 inches long, with bracts that are often reddish-brown. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The Idaho white fir is valued for its timber and is also an important species in forest ecosystems.</p>
