                    <h1>Aerangis mystacidioides</h1>
<p>Aerangis mystacidioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender stems and striking, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
