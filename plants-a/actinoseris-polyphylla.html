                <h1>Actinoseris polyphylla</h1>
<p>Actinoseris polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leaved sunflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with a distinctive center of bracts, which resemble a cluster of small petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Actinoseris polyphylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in xerophytic gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinoseris polyphylla has leaves that are typically lobed or divided, with a silvery or grayish-green color, arranged in a rosette pattern, and varying in size from small to moderately large depending on environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The stem is usually short and thick, with a rough, hairy texture and a pale green or brownish color, growing close to the ground. Its flowers are showy, with a radial symmetry, featuring bright yellow petals and a central cluster of stamens, blooming in the summer months and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinoseris polyphylla is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and parts of Sonora and Sinaloa. This species typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, including sandy soils and rocky habitats. It is commonly observed in desert ecosystems, where it thrives in full sun conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native range, displaying resilience to drought and extreme temperatures.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinoseris polyphylla was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and coastal environments due to its adaptability to harsh conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and in dunes. The plant has been reported in several regions of the United States, particularly in the western states. Its introduction is often associated with human activities such as land development and coastal construction.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
