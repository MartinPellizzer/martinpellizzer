<p>Ateramnus recurvus, commonly known as the curling fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, curling fronds that unfurl as they mature.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, preferring cool and humid conditions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Ateramnus recurvus plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
