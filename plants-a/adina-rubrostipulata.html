                <h1>Adina rubrostipulata</h1>
<p>Adina rubrostipulata, commonly known as the red-stippled adina, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often red-stippled along the veins, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina rubrostipulata has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and slightly woody, with a reddish-brown bark that is smooth when young and becomes fissured with age. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white in color, consisting of five petals and five sepals, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping the plant anchor in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina rubrostipulata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. The plant thrives in humid environments with well-drained soils, often growing in the understory of dense vegetation. It is known for its distinctive red-tinged leaf stalks and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into parts of Papua New Guinea and the Indian subcontinent as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina rubrostipulata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in temperate climates. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its competitive nature and impact on native vegetation.</p>
