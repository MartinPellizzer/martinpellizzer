                <h1>Adina rubrostipulata</h1>
<p>Adina rubrostipulata, commonly known as the red-stippled adina, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have distinctive red veins or stipules.</p>
<p>Adina rubrostipulata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina rubrostipulata has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a reddish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly fissured, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, and have a pale yellow color, blooming in the spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina rubrostipulata is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>While it was once found in its native range, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and degradation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. Adina rubrostipulata typically grows at altitudes between 200 and 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adina rubrostipulata is a striking evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia, prized for its vibrant red leaves and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-ripe cuttings, with cuttings offering faster and more reliable results. The plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in warm, humid climates and requiring a period of dormancy during winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring and regular pruning to shape the plant and encourage new growth are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or other shade-loving plants can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adina rubrostipulata is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in certain ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Adina rubrostipulata contributes to soil health by acting as a nitrogen fixer through its symbiotic relationship with bacteria.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Adina rubrostipulata is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its flowers are sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to biodiversity and supports pollinators, though it lacks significant commercial use. Culturally, it holds symbolic meaning in some regions, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its role in traditional medicine and ecological systems highlights its importance in both local and environmental contexts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Adina rubrostipulata has several varieties and cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, with popular cultivars such as 'Variegata' and 'Compacta' standing out for their unique foliage patterns and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>While the plant is not widely hybridized, some horticultural crosses have been developed to enhance its cold tolerance and foliage coloration. These cultivars are often used in shady garden settings due to their ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Adina rubrostipulata holds horticultural importance as a valuable evergreen shrub that adds texture and color to woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its cultivation is also appreciated for its role in supporting local biodiversity and providing habitat for pollinators.</p>
