                    <h1>Artanthe pothomorpha</h1>
<p>Artanthe pothomorpha, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss, and its flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Artanthe pothomorpha is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
