                    <h1>Albertisia mecistophylla</h1>
<p>Albertisia mecistophylla, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing spores in specialized structures called sori. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a complex arrangement of tiny leaflets.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Albertisia mecistophylla is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
