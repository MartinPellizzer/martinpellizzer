                <h1>Acinodendron mucronatum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron mucronatum, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by green, fleshy capsules containing toxic seeds. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its milky sap, it is also referred to as the milk tree.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron mucronatum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, clustered flowers are white or pale yellow, with five petals, and bloom during the dry season, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping the plant anchor in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron mucronatum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in woodland and savanna habitats, often growing in areas with well-drained soils. This plant is adapted to the warm and humid climate of these regions, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Its distribution is largely restricted to eastern and southern Africa, where it thrives in open landscapes with moderate rainfall.</p>
<p>Acinodendron mucronatum is not found outside of these specific geographic areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron mucronatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic plant species for cultivation. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and spreads through its rhizomes, making it difficult to control.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the risks associated with bringing non-native species into new environments.</p>
