<p>Aspidium acutum, commonly known as the acute spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a delicate, creeping rhizome with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a small, kidney-shaped indusium.</p>
<p>Aspidium acutum is commonly found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
