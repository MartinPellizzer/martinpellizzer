<p>Atriplex subdecumbens, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, waxy hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>Atriplex subdecumbens plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
