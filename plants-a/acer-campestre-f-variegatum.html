                <h1>Acer campestre f. variegatum</h1>
<p>Acer campestre f. variegatum, commonly known as the variegated field maple, is a cultivar of the common maple tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking variegated leaves, which display a mix of green, white, and gold colors. This plant is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged seeds, typical of the maple genus.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. variegatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 3â€“7 cm in length, with a striking variegated pattern of white, yellow, and green on the upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with smooth, light gray bark that develops shallow furrows as the plant matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, relying on wind pollination for reproduction. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule, which is dispersed by wind, allowing the seeds to travel several meters from the parent plant.</p>
<p>Its root system is shallow and fibrous, adapting to well-drained soils and providing stability in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campestre f. variegatum is a cultivar of the European horse chestnut known for its variegated foliage.</p>
<p>Native to the temperate regions of Europe, it has been widely introduced to other parts of the world. It thrives in a variety of environments, including gardens, parks, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sun. This plant typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level up to 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not considered endangered, its cultivation is often limited to ornamental purposes, leading to a decrease in its natural wild population.</p>
