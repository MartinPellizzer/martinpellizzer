                <h1>Adenostyles briquetii</h1>
<p>Adenostyles briquetii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or open habitats. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a purple or red throat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Adenostyles briquetii is adapted to thrive in regions with mild, wet winters and dry summers.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostyles briquetii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant grows. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and typically pink to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles briquetii is primarily native to Corsica.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the Mediterranean region, specifically on the island of Corsica. It thrives in rocky and limestone soils, often in open habitats such as cliffs and slopes. Adenostyles briquetii is adapted to the climate of Corsica, which includes mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to this specific island, making it a unique endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles briquetii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common invader in disturbed landscapes. This plant is particularly successful in Mediterranean climates due to its drought tolerance and rapid growth rate. It can outcompete native vegetation, leading to reduced biodiversity in invaded areas.</p>
<p>Its spread is often facilitated by human activity, including construction and land development.</p>
