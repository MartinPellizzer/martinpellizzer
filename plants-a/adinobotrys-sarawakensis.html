                <h1>Adinobotrys sarawakensis</h1>
<p>Adinobotrys sarawakensis, commonly known as the Sarawak starvine, is a climbing shrub native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinobotrys sarawakensis has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 10-15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with yellowish-white petals and a sweet fragrance, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule containing numerous small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinobotrys sarawakensis is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this region, particularly in the lowland and hill forest areas. This species is endemic to the island, meaning it is not found naturally anywhere else in the world. It thrives in humid and shaded environments, typically growing as an understory plant.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable component of Borneo's biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinobotrys sarawakensis was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in lowland and foothill regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in secondary forests or along riverbanks. This plant is commonly found in Southeast Asia, particularly in Borneo, where it has been observed in both natural and cultivated settings. Its introduction to new regions is often associated with human activity, such as horticultural trade or accidental spread.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has shown potential for both ecological and agricultural applications in suitable habitats.</p>
