                    <h1>Andryala allochroa</h1>
<p>Andryala allochroa, commonly known as the white sand lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to white thallus, which is covered in a layer of fine, powdery granules. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and cyanobacteria, which contribute to its photosynthetic capabilities. It is often found on bare soil or rock surfaces in regions with low humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and contributing to nutrient cycling in harsh ecosystems.</p>
