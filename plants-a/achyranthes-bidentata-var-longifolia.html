<p>Achyranthes bidentata var. longifolia, commonly known as the Chinese knotweed, is a perennial herb native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features erect, branched stems that are often reddish in color and covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by three-lobed, heart-shaped fruits. Its leaves are ovate with prominent veins and serrated edges, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This variant is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes bidentata var. longifolia has lanceolate to ovate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a bluish-green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, dark brown bark that is slightly fissured, and it grows upright with a sprawling habit. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense spikes, blooming from June to August, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, ellipsoid seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, penetrating deep into the soil to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes bidentata var. longifolia is a variant of a widely distributed plant species native to East Asia, including regions of China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>While it originally thrived in its native range, it is now also found in parts of Southeast Asia and even in some temperate regions of Europe and North America due to human introduction. This plant prefers moist, shady environments such as forest floors and stream banks, often growing in clay or loamy soils. It typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, it is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, though habitat loss in its native regions poses a potential threat.</p>
