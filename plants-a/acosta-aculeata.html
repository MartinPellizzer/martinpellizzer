                <h1>Acosta aculeata</h1>
<p>Acosta aculeata, commonly known as the hairy acacia, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by flat, bean-like pods. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Acosta aculeata is adapted to dry environments and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta aculeata has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with yellowish-white petals and stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta aculeata is primarily native to South America, specifically found in countries such as Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands, shrublands, and disturbed areas within these regions. The plant thrives in temperate to subtropical climates and is often associated with dry or semi-arid environments. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is known for its spiny stems and yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can be found in various habitats across the southern part of South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta aculeata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, pastures, and degraded forests.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with a warm and dry climate, particularly in South America. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, which allows it to spread quickly in new environments. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production contribute to its invasive potential in non-native areas.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been reported in several countries across the Americas.</p>
