                <h1>Acmella decumbens var. decumbens</h1>
<p>Acmella decumbens var. decumbens, commonly known as the Mexican sunflower or Tithonia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright orange to yellow-orange flowers, which bloom in the summer months. The plant has a bushy growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant flowers and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dye.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella decumbens var. decumbens has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, with a smooth surface and a glossy dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is prostrate, with a slightly hairy texture and a greenish-brown color, growing along the ground. The flowers are small, yellow with a prominent red center, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the warm season, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small seeds through mechanical means when the capsule dries and splits.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella decumbens var. decumbens is a species native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Amazon Basin and surrounding lowland areas. It thrives in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and seasonally flooded grasslands. This plant typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 300 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is considered vulnerable, though it remains relatively stable in some protected areas.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmella decumbens var. decumbens is a low-growing, flowering plant commonly cultivated for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter method offering faster and more reliable results. The plant has a relatively short growth cycle, typically blooming within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acmella decumbens var. decumbens is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small birds, by offering both nectar and shelter in its dense growth habit. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its ability to suppress weeds and improve soil health. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acmella decumbens var. decumbens is a plant known for its diverse uses across various fields.</p>
