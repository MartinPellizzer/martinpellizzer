                <h1>Acer eriocarpum</h1>
<p>Acer eriocarpum, commonly known as the woolly maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, grayish-green leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, red to orange-red flowers in early spring, followed by elongated, woody fruits called samaras. Its bark is smooth and often has a reddish or brownish hue, and it thrives in moist, acidic soils.</p>
<p>The woolly maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer eriocarpum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 3â€“6 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. The flowers are inconspicuous, greenish-yellow in color, and appear in early spring, with wind as the primary pollination method. The fruit is a small, hairy samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are winged for aerial transport.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer eriocarpum is a rare and critically endangered species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>Although its native range is limited, it has been introduced to some botanical gardens and conservation facilities in other parts of the world, including Europe and North America. This species thrives in humid, temperate forests at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, often growing on rocky slopes or in shaded understories. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Acer eriocarpum is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List, with very few wild populations remaining.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique and ecologically important tree.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer eriocarpum is a deciduous tree known for its unique, spiky fruits and vibrant fall foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The tree grows slowly, reaching maturity over several decades, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like lavender or rosemary can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer eriocarpum is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing the health of surrounding flora. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer eriocarpum supports ecological balance by offering habitat and resources in forest and woodland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer eriocarpum is a species of maple native to China, known for its unique appearance and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties, such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to local biodiversity and supports wildlife, though it lacks significant commercial value. Culturally, it may hold symbolic meaning in traditional Chinese practices, though specific roles are not well documented.</p>
<p>Overall, its primary importance lies in its role within natural ecosystems rather than direct human use.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer eriocarpum has a limited number of naturally occurring varieties, but it is more widely recognized for its cultivated forms and hybrids.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson Sentinel' and 'Ruby Glow,' which are prized for their vibrant fall colors and compact growth habit. Hybridization with other maple species, such as Acer palmatum, has led to the development of ornamental varieties that offer enhanced horticultural traits. These hybrids are often used in gardens and landscapes for their aesthetic value and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer eriocarpum holds horticultural importance due to its ornamental potential and the diversity of forms achieved through cultivation and hybridization.</p>
