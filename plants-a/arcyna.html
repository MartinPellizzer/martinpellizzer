<p>Arcyna, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, primarily found in the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and their showy, umbellate inflorescences. Arcyna species typically bloom in spring, producing white or pink flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>However, many species within this genus are toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
