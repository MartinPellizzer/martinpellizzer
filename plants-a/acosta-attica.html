                <h1>Acosta attica</h1>
<p>Acosta attica, commonly known as the sacred plant of the Andean people, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers and dark green, waxy leaves. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has cultural significance in traditional Andean rituals. Its botanical features include a compact growth habit and the ability to thrive in cool, temperate climates.</p>
<p>Acosta attica is also valued for its potential medicinal properties in traditional medicine practices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta attica has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing upright with few branches. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta attica is primarily native to the highland regions of southern South America, specifically in countries such as Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Andean foothills and mountainous areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level. This plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and moderate rainfall. It is often associated with rocky or gravelly substrates in open grasslands and shrublands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta attica was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate temperatures and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in the southern United States, particularly in Texas and Florida. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation make it an invasive species in these regions.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is often found colonizing areas where native vegetation has been disrupted.</p>
