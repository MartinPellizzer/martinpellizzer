                <h1>Adina eurhyncha</h1>
<p>Adina eurhyncha, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and rich color. The tree has simple, opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth surface and a glossy appearance. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, spherical fruits.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the production of valuable timber.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina eurhyncha has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that are glossy green in color and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. Its small, white flowers are clustered in racemes, bloom during the spring season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that contains a single seed, which is dispersed by wind due to its feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to efficiently absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina eurhyncha is primarily native to Borneo, Malaya, and Sumatera.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical rainforests of these regions. It thrives in humid and warm climates with ample rainfall. Adina eurhyncha is typically found in lowland and hill forest areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with the natural ecosystems of Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina eurhyncha was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including land development and the movement of plant material.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
