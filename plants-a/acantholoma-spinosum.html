                        <h1>Acantholoma spinosum</h1>
<p>Acantholoma spinosum, commonly known as the spiny acantholoma, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fleshy, spiny leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine, bristle-like hairs, which provide additional protection against desiccation.</p>
<p>Acantholoma spinosum is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can go dormant during periods of extreme drought.</p>
