<p>Andryala sinuata, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It typically features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous slender, succulent stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and often have a wavy or notched margin, adapted to retain moisture in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>Andryala sinuata is well-suited to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra or high-altitude habitats.</p>
