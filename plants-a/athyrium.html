                    <h1>Athyrium</h1>
<p>Athyrium, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a genus of ferns native to Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their finely divided, often colorful fronds that resemble painted patterns, hence their common name. Athyrium species typically grow in shaded, moist environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Their rhizomatous growth habit allows them to spread and form dense clumps over time.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the late spring and summer months.</p>
