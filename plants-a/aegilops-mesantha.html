                <h1>Aegilops mesantha</h1>
<p>Aegilops mesantha, commonly known as the slender wild wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear颖果, which are typically brown or gray in color. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Aegilops mesantha is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops mesantha has narrow, grass-like leaves that are mostly basal, with a bluish-green color and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, growing upright with a clumping growth pattern. Its flowers are spike-like, with pale green to white florets that bloom in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy soils.</p>
