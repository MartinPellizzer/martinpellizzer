                    <h1>Ampelopsis heterophylla var. brevipedunculata</h1>
<p>Ampelopsis heterophylla var. brevipedunculata, commonly known as the broadleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped to ovate leaves that vary in size and shape along the stems, giving it its heterophyllous characteristic. The plant produces small, fragrant yellowish-green flowers in late summer, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes.</p>
<p>Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in shaded areas.</p>
