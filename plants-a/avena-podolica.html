<p>Avena podolica, commonly known as Polish oat or Podolia oat, is a perennial grass species native to Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, white to pale green flowers, which are followed by cylindrical, spike-like fruits called achenes. Avena podolica is adapted to temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable forage crop and a subject of ecological study.</p>
