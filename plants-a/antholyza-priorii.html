<p>Antholyza priorii, commonly known as the prior's antholyza, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Antholyza priorii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
