                    <h1>Arenaria arctica var. minor</h1>
<p>Arenaria arctica var. minor, commonly known as the Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers during the short summer season, which attract pollinators like bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountain environments.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to extreme environmental conditions, making it a resilient member of Arctic flora.</p>
