                <h1>Adenonema cherleriae</h1>
<p>Adenonema cherleriae, commonly known as the Cherlera's adenonema, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers. It produces small, round fruits that are typically green when mature.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within its family.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenonema cherleriae has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 2â€“4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, woody, and have a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom from April to June and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenonema cherleriae is primarily native to Altay, Amur, Buryatiya, China North-Central, Chita, Inner Mongolia, Irkutsk, Khabarovsk, Krasnoyarsk, Mongolia, Tuva, and Yakutiya.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the temperate and subarctic regions of these areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with river valleys and forested slopes. The species is well adapted to the cold climate of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in the local flora of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenonema cherleriae was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 1970s and has since spread throughout the country. The plant thrives in coastal environments and is commonly found on sandy soils. It is considered a non-native species that has established itself in the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Despite its introduction, it has not become invasive and remains a rare plant in New Zealand.</p>
