                    <h1>Asarum wulongense</h1>
<p>Asarum wulongense, commonly known as Wulong wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, irregularly shaped flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported medicinal properties.</p>
<p>However, like other members of its family, it contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and potentially carcinogenic.</p>
