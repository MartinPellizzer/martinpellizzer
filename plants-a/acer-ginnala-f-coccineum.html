<p>Acer ginnala f. coccineum, commonly known as the red twiga maple, is a compact, deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright red foliage, which turns orange in the fall, making it a striking ornamental plant. The leaves are palmately lobed, with a smooth margin and a dense, upright growth habit. It produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, winged samaras.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its vibrant color and adaptability to a variety of soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala f. coccineum has palmately compound leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a vibrant red to orange coloration during the growing season.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala f. coccineum is a variant of the horse chestnut tree native to eastern Asia, specifically China, where it grows in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes cultivation in temperate regions worldwide, though it remains primarily found in its native habitat. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often growing in forest understories. It typically occurs at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of concern in some regions, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala f. coccineum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red foliage and compact size, making it ideal for small gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The tree has a slow to moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in 10 to 15 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs like hydrangeas or perennials such as heuchera can enhance its ornamental value and promote a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>
