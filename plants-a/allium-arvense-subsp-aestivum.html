<p>Allium arvense subsp.</p>
<p>aestivum, commonly known as summer garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a flowering stem that bears small, umbel-like clusters of white or pale pink flowers.</p>
<p>The plant produces bulbous structures that are often mistaken for true garlic bulbs, though they are less pungent and more fibrous. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for both ornamental gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
