                <h1>Adhatoda protracta</h1>
<p>Adhatoda protracta, commonly known as the African bignonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, which bloom during the rainy season. Its bark is smooth and light brown, and it has a distinctive scent when crushed.</p>
<p>Adhatoda protracta is often found in moist woodland and riverine habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda protracta has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 3 to 6 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and has a greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, growing in a climbing or trailing pattern. Its flowers are small, tubular, and violet in color, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help the plant anchor itself while also absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda protracta is primarily native to parts of Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Thailand, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with humid climates. This plant typically grows in open forests, along riverbanks, and in moist, well-drained soils. It is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Adhatoda protracta is known for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine systems across its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda protracta was mainly introduced to new habitats in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It has been documented in countries such as India, Thailand, and the Philippines, where it is often cultivated for traditional medicine. The plant's ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and climates has contributed to its spread beyond its native range. It is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are being explored to manage its distribution and mitigate ecological impacts.</p>
