                <h1>Adhatoda protracta</h1>
<p>Adhatoda protracta, commonly known as the African snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, featuring smooth, dark green leaves with a slightly velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its roots are widely used in traditional medicine for their antimalarial and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical significance lies in its adaptability to various soil types and its role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda protracta has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly pubescent surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that is slightly rough to the touch, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern with branching occurring from the base. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with a tubular shape and a striking blue or violet color, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, aiding in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda protracta is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent, particularly found in regions of India, Nepal, and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>It is now distributed across parts of Southeast Asia, including Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, where it has been introduced. This species thrives in humid environments, often growing in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along riverbanks. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Adhatoda protracta is considered to be of conservation concern in some areas.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda protracta is a tropical plant known for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for faster growth. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and encourage new shoots. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adhatoda protracta is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies due to its showy flowers and nectar. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring crops by improving soil health. It also plays a role in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Adhatoda protracta contributes to biodiversity by offering a habitat and food source in its native ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Adhatoda protracta is a versatile plant with a range of uses across different domains.</p>
<p>In culinary applications, its leaves are sometimes used as a vegetable in local dishes, adding a unique flavor. Medicinally, it has been traditionally used to treat respiratory ailments and skin conditions due to its anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, the plant contributes to local economies through its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes.</p>
