                <h1>Actinea depressa</h1>
<p>Actinea depressa, commonly known as the flat starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that are typically green to reddish in color, adapted to retain moisture in soggy environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in a star-like arrangement during the spring and early summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Actinea depressa plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinea depressa has leaves that are typically heart-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light green to brownish color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in umbels, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea depressa is primarily native to the eastern United States, including states such as Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded habitats like woodlands, along stream banks, and in rich, organic soils. This species thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with forest understory environments. Its distribution is largely restricted to the southeastern region of the country.</p>
<p>It is not commonly found outside of this geographic range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea depressa was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has established itself in various regions outside its native range, often in disturbed or urban environments. The plant's ability to thrive in diverse soil types contributes to its spread. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its competitive growth.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited compared to other introduced species.</p>
