<p>Angiopteris caudatiformis, commonly known as the long-tailed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies such as rivers and swamps. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The fronds have a distinctive elongated shape, with the terminal pinnae extending in a long, slender form, giving it its common name.</p>
