                <h1>Achillea millefolium f. plecicaensis</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. plecicaensis, commonly known as the Plecicaensis yarrow, is a horticultural form of the common yarrow.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. This variant is typically shorter and more compact than the standard species, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, exhibiting drought tolerance once established.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and long-lasting floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. plecicaensis has finely divided, feathery leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure up to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and upright, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age, growing in a basal rosette pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding dark褐色 disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a cypsela, a type of achene, which is dispersed by wind due to its pappus structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. plecicaensis is a rare subspecies of yarrow that is native to the Carpathian Basin, primarily found in Hungary and parts of Croatia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to specific regions within these areas, where it grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It thrives in temperate climates at moderate altitudes, typically between 300 and 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this subspecies is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its natural environment.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. plecicaensis is a compact, flowering perennial known for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seeds sown in late summer. This plant has a typical growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring and light pruning after blooming helps maintain its shape and vigor. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. plecicaensis is a perennial plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its bright yellow flowers, supporting biodiversity in local ecosystems. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its aromatic properties. It also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system, stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and offering habitat for beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. plecicaensis is a lesser-known variant of yarrow, primarily valued for its medicinal properties, including its use in traditional herbal remedies for treating wounds, inflammation, and digestive issues.</p>
<p>While it is not as widely used in culinary applications as other yarrow varieties, it may be incorporated into certain herbal teas or infusions. In industrial and economic contexts, it holds potential for pharmaceutical development due to its bioactive compounds. Culturally, it may symbolize protection or healing, though its symbolic significance is less documented compared to the common yarrow.</p>
<p>Overall, its role remains largely underexplored in modern applications.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. plecicaensis has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated in gardens for their ornamental value, including 'Aurea' and 'Purpurea,' which showcase striking yellow and purple foliage respectively.</p>
<p>This form is also frequently used in hybrid breeding programs to introduce unique color variations and improved hardiness. Hybrids derived from this form often combine the vigor of Achillea millefolium with the distinctive foliage traits of f. plecicaensis. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to add texture and color to rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, it remains a valued addition to modern landscape design.</p>
