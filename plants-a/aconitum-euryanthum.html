                <h1>Aconitum euryanthum</h1>
<p>Aconitum euryanthum, commonly known as the Indian aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and a distinctive, hairy stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum euryanthum has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically reaching up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a straight, unbranched pattern. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petal-like sepals and a spurs, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous, thick, and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum euryanthum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. This species is commonly found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes where the climate is cool and moist. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat, including strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum euryanthum was mainly introduced to gardens and horticultural collections due to its striking floral display and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its tall, spikelike inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and has been introduced to various parts of the world for ornamental purposes. However, it is considered invasive in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its ecological impact in non-native habitats.</p>
