                    <h1>Atriplex rusbyi</h1>
<p>Atriplex rusbyi, commonly known as Rusby's saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Atriplex rusbyi also plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion in its native habitat.</p>
