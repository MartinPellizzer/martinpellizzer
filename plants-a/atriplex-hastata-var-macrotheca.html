                    <h1>Atriplex hastata var. macrotheca</h1>
<p>Atriplex hastata var. macrotheca, commonly known as the large-seeded saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by inflated, three-lobed seed pods. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for stabilizing degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect adaptations to extreme conditions, including deep root systems and waxy leaf coatings.</p>
