                <h1>Adelonema erythropus</h1>
<p>Adelonema erythropus, commonly known as the red-stemmed euphorbia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems that display a reddish hue, especially when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Adelonema erythropus is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelonema erythropus has leaves that are simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelonema erythropus is primarily native to Brazil North and Colombia.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these areas.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in the local biodiversity of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelonema erythropus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun exposure and moderate to well-drained soils. The plant has been documented in parts of Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Indonesia. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native vegetation in invaded areas.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered a potential weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems.</p>
