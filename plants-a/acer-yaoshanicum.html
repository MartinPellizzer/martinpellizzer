                <h1>Acer yaoshanicum</h1>
<p>Acer yaoshanicum, commonly known as the Yaoshan maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant autumn foliage, which displays shades of red, orange, and yellow. The tree typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and features palmate leaves with five lobes. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds.</p>
<p>This ornamental species is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer yaoshanicum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, turning vibrant red or orange in the fall. The stem is slender with a smooth, light grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous, helping to stabilize the plant in its woodland habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer yaoshanicum is a rare flowering tree native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces in southwestern China.</p>
<p>It is currently found in limited areas within its native range, primarily in remote, forested regions. This species thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soils, typically growing in mixed evergreen and deciduous forests. It is commonly found at altitudes between 2,000 and 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acer yaoshanicum is classified as critically endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer yaoshanicum is a deciduous tree known for its striking autumn foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seed propagation requiring a cold stratification period to break dormancy. The growth cycle of this species involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and companion planting with shade-tolerant species can enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer yaoshanicum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, supporting local ecosystems. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and promoting the growth of other plant species. Its root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for land conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in carbon sequestration, aiding in climate regulation.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer yaoshanicum is a rare tree species native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine. The tree contributes to local biodiversity and soil stabilization, making it valuable in environmental conservation efforts. It holds cultural significance in certain regions, where it is admired for its unique foliage and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological role, Acer yaoshanicum also plays an important part in supporting local economies through ecotourism and scientific research.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer yaoshanicum has several varieties and cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, with popular cultivars such as 'Variegatum' and 'Atrovirens' standing out for their striking foliage patterns.</p>
<p>It is also a parent species in various hybrids, including the widely cultivated Acer griseum, which shares some of its distinctive leaf characteristics. These hybrids are often favored in horticulture for their adaptability and visual appeal in gardens. The plant's unique leaf colors and growth habits contribute to its horticultural importance in both landscape design and botanical collections.</p>
<p>Its genetic contribution to ornamental maples enhances the diversity available to gardeners and landscapers.</p>
