                <h1>Adiantum lambertianum</h1>
<p>Adiantum lambertianum, commonly known as the Lambert's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum lambertianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum lambertianum has fern-like leaves that are finely divided, pinnately arranged, and typically have a delicate, lace-like appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually light green, with a slender, upright growth habit and can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant has a slender, wiry stem that is smooth and slightly green in color, growing from a rhizome. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures rather than true flowers, and it does not produce fruits or seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum lambertianum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest environments. This fern thrives in areas with rich, well-drained soil and high humidity. It is particularly common in Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and dense canopy of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum lambertianum was mainly introduced to North America through horticultural trade and cultivation efforts.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas and along stream banks. This fern is known for its delicate, lace-like fronds and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions where it can thrive in the wild.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and is generally managed as a non-native species.</p>
