                    <h1>Azorella caespitosa</h1>
<p>Azorella caespitosa, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a hardy evergreen shrub native to the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It forms dense, low-growing mats of foliage, which help it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are tightly packed to reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>Azorella caespitosa is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
