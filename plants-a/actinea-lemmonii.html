                <h1>Actinea lemmonii</h1>
<p>Actinea lemmonii, commonly known as the Lemmon's actinia, is a species of sea anemone found in the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent tentacles and a slender, flexible body. This marine organism typically inhabits rocky substrates in shallow coastal waters. Actinea lemmonii plays a role in the marine ecosystem as both predator and prey.</p>
<p>Its reproductive cycle involves both sexual and asexual methods, contributing to its population dynamics in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinea lemmonii has small, heart-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are clustered in umbels, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea lemmonii is primarily native to the western United States, specifically found in California and parts of Oregon.</p>
<p>It grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. This plant is often associated with coastal and mountainous regions where humidity is relatively high. It is commonly found in areas with rich, organic soil and partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea lemmonii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along streambanks. The plant thrives in cool, humid climates and is often associated with coniferous or mixed woodlands. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several ecological communities, though it is not considered invasive.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is less common in more disturbed or open environments.</p>
