                    <h1>Agrostis pilosula var. alpestris</h1>
<p>Agrostis pilosula var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, making it well adapted to harsh alpine environments. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils at high elevations. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or barren areas.</p>
