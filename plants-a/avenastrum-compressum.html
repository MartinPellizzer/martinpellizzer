                    <h1>Avenastrum compressum</h1>
<p>Avenastrum compressum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, bluish-green leaves that are tightly compressed along the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are clustered in spikelets. Avenastrum compressum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of desert ecosystems, providing habitat and forage for local wildlife.</p>
