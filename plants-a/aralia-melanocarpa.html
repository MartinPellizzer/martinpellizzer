<p>Aralia melanocarpa, commonly known as black aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves that are typically divided into 5 to 9 leaflets, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, which are followed by dark purple berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Black aralia thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, woodland environments.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage and ornamental berries make it a popular choice for shade gardens.</p>
