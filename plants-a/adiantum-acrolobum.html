<p>Adiantum acrolobum, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>The shield fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.</p>
