                    <h1>Acanthodus</h1>
<p>Acanthodus, commonly known as the spiny shark, is an extinct genus of jawless fish from the Silurian period.</p>
<p>It belongs to the class Placodermi and is characterized by its bony, armored head and a distinctive array of spines. Acanthodus had a conical, elongated body with a large, tooth-like structure at the front, used for grasping prey. Its fins were supported by a series of bony rays, and it was a predatory fish that inhabited freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Fossils of Acanthodus provide important insights into the early evolution of vertebrates and the development of jaw structures.</p>
