                        <h1>Acacia malacophylla</h1>
<p>Acacia malacophylla, commonly known as the yellow wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf-like structures that reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Acacia malacophylla is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a source of nectar for native pollinators.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia malacophylla is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, South Africa, and parts of Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found in savanna and shrubland ecosystems. This species is well adapted to drought conditions and can tolerate high temperatures. It is often seen growing in open woodlands and along riverbanks in its native range.</p>
<p>Acacia malacophylla plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia malacophylla was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and on sandy soils, often along the eastern and southern coasts. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy substrates. It has been introduced for its ornamental value and as a potential source of fuelwood.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in some ecosystems.</p>
