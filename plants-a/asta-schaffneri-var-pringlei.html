<p>Asta schaffneri var. pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's asta, is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, often with contrasting white or yellow throats. Native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
