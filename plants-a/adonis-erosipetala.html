                <h1>Adonis erosipetala</h1>
<p>Adonis erosipetala, commonly known as the pink-flowered adonis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes buttercups and other showy wildflowers. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Adonis erosipetala is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis erosipetala has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age. Its flowers are showy, with five petals arranged in a radial symmetry, displaying a striking pinkish-red color, and bloom in early summer; they are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained, rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis erosipetala is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, including countries such as Austria, France, Italy, and Spain.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often found in rocky soils and open meadows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. This plant is also present in parts of northern Africa, particularly in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco and Algeria. It is well adapted to cold climates and is commonly found in areas with limited vegetation cover.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many of its native regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis erosipetala was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread throughout various regions of the country. The plant thrives in open, sunny areas and is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas have led to its classification as an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and prevent further ecological impact.</p>
