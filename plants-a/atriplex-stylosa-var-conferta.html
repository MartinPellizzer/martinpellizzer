                    <h1>Atriplex stylosa var. conferta</h1>
<p>Atriplex stylosa var. conferta, commonly known as coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to coastal areas of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its salt-tolerant nature, allowing it to thrive in saline soils and coastal environments. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces small greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly adapted to withstand strong winds and salt spray, making it an important species in maritime ecosystems.</p>
