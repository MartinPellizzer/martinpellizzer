                    <h1>Andreettaea</h1>
<p>Andreettaea, commonly known as the Brazilian heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plants typically have small, evergreen leaves and produce clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Andreettaea species are often found in forest understories and are valued for their ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>They have a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which helps them absorb nutrients from poor soils.</p>
