                        <h1>Acacia macrophylla</h1>
<p>Acacia macrophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with bacteria. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions.</p>
<p>Acacia macrophylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia macrophylla is primarily native to eastern Australia, including regions such as New South Wales, Queensland, and the ACT.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry sclerophyll forests and woodlands. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with coastal and inland areas. It is well adapted to the climate of the southeastern part of the country.</p>
<p>The plant is also present in some parts of South Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia macrophylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and fast growth rate.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in various regions, particularly in coastal and riverine areas. The plant thrives in a wide range of soil types and is tolerant of both drought and moderate frost. Its rapid spread has led to concerns about its impact on native ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Management strategies are being developed to control its spread and mitigate its environmental effects.</p>
