<p>It is native to the Indian subcontinent and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant features erect, branched stems covered with soft, hairy leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, typically displaying shades of pink or red.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes shahii has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 cm in length with a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a smooth texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spike-like inflorescences, with greenish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the Indian subcontinent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes shahii was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as agriculture and horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions. The plant has shown adaptability to various climates, which has contributed to its spread in different regions. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is currently not classified as a major threat to native plant species in most areas.</p>
