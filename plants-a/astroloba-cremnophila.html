<p>Astroloba cremnophila, commonly known as the star-shaped bulbous plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Astroloba cremnophila is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
