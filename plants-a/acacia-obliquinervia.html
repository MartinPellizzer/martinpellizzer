                <h1>Acacia obliquinervia</h1>
<p>Acacia obliquinervia, commonly known as the narrow-veined acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves with narrow, elongated leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flower spikes that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in pod-like fruits, which contain hard, angular seeds used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Acacia obliquinervia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia obliquinervia has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being elliptical in shape, dark green in color, and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The flowers are yellow, clustered in dense spherical heads, and bloom during the dry season, being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant to access water in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia obliquinervia is a small shrub native to Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of southern China and the eastern regions of India. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in disturbed soils and along riverbanks. This species is typically found at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as near threatened.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia obliquinervia is a hardy shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia, known for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in diverse conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. The plant grows best in warm climates, entering a dormant phase during winter, and shows rapid growth during the wet season.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to shape the plant and encourage new growth are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like marigold or basil can help deter pests and improve soil health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acacia obliquinervia is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects, birds, and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its nectar-rich flowers, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, improving soil fertility and supporting the growth of other vegetation. Its deep root system also helps in erosion control, stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Additionally, it serves as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing biodiversity and sustainability.</p>
