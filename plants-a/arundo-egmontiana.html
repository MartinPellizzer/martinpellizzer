                    <h1>Arundo egmontiana</h1>
<p>Arundo egmontiana, commonly known as the Egmont reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features slender, hollow stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, and its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, greenish-white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in wetlands and riparian zones, often forming dense stands that help prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both ecologically valuable and potentially invasive in non-native environments.</p>
