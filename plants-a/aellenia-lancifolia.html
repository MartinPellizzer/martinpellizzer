                <h1>Aellenia lancifolia</h1>
<p>Aellenia lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aellenia, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered white flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Aellenia lancifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aellenia lancifolia has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a light brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in dry, sandy soils.</p>
