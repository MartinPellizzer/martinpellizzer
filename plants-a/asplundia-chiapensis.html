<p>Asplundia chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly found in the humid lowland forests of Chiapas, Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyclanthaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are used as a starch source. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention in its tropical environment. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the wet season.</p>
<p>Asplundia chiapensis is an important species for both local biodiversity and traditional agriculture in its native region.</p>
