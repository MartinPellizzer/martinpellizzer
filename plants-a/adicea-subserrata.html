                <h1>Adicea subserrata</h1>
<p>Adicea subserrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock rose, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often colorful flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a serrated edge, giving it its scientific name.</p>
<p>Adicea subserrata produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea subserrata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, and are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, blooming from spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea subserrata is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant thrives in moist to saturated soils and is often associated with disturbed or tidal areas. It is an important component of the wetland ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the coastal regions of the southeastern U.S. due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea subserrata was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides, fields, and urban environments. The plant spreads primarily through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind, water, and animals. Its adaptability to various soil types and climates has contributed to its successful establishment in non-native regions.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
