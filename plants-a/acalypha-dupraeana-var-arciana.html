<p>Acalypha dupraeana var. arciana, commonly known as the red-veined nettle, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vividly colored foliage, featuring deep red veins against a dark green background. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is popular in tropical and subtropical gardens for its bold, eye-catching appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha dupraeana var. arciana has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a vibrant green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture. The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a light brown bark that is smooth when young and becomes slightly fissured with age. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, blooming during the summer months, and is primarily pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its moist, tropical habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha dupraeana var. arciana is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed primarily in the eastern part of the island, particularly in the rainforest regions. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha dupraeana var. arciana is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant foliage and unique growth patterns.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method for quick and successful growth. This plant thrives in warm, humid conditions and has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season promotes lush growth, while pruning helps maintain its shape and encourage bushier growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but can be affected by aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants like hibiscus or crotons can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a healthy garden ecosystem.</p>
