                    <h1>Androsace villosa f. breviscapa</h1>
<p>Androsace villosa f. breviscapa, commonly known as the short-stemmed alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
