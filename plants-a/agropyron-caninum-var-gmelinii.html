<p>Agropyron caninum var. gmelinii, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils and low moisture conditions.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat.</p>
