                    <h1>Atriplex cephalantha</h1>
<p>Atriplex cephalantha, commonly known as sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, typical of the Chenopodiaceae family. Its extensive root system allows it to thrive in poor, sandy soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Atriplex cephalantha plays a vital role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
