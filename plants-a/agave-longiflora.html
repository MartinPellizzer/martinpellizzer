                    <h1>Agave longiflora</h1>
<p>Agave longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered agave, is a striking succulent native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, blue-green leaves that are lined with sharp spines, providing both aesthetic appeal and natural defense. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear numerous white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping in dry climates.</p>
