                    <h1>Acioa floribunda</h1>
<p>Acioa floribunda, commonly known as the clustered acacia, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Acioa floribunda plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
