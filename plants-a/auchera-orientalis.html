<p>Auchera orientalis, commonly known as the oriental bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early flowering habit and ability to thrive in cooler climates.</p>
