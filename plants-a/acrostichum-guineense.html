<p>Acrostichum guineense, commonly known as the African water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating fronds that are typically divided into small, serrated leaflets. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Acrostichum guineense plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
