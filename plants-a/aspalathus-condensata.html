                    <h1>Aspalathus condensata</h1>
<p>Aspalathus condensata, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a source of rooibos tea, which is harvested from its young stems and leaves.</p>
<p>Aspalathus condensata is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
