                <h1>Actinocephalus koernickeanus</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus koernickeanus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with leaves that are elliptical and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain numerous small, hard seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus koernickeanus has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are usually green and vary in size depending on the environment, with a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical and slightly woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that develops fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus koernickeanus is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. This plant thrives in coastal and sandy environments, often growing in dune systems. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within South Africa due to its ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus koernickeanus was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban areas where it can thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant has adapted well to a variety of climates, allowing it to spread beyond its native range. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces contribute to its success as an introduced species.</p>
<p>However, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings due to its invasive tendencies.</p>
