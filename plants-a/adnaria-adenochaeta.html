                <h1>Adnaria adenochaeta</h1>
<p>Adnaria adenochaeta, commonly known as the hairy sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Goodeniaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant is characterized by its blue or violet flowers and hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and cliffs.</p>
<p>Adnaria adenochaeta is well adapted to salt spray and is an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria adenochaeta has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a slightly serrated margin, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria adenochaeta is primarily native to the eastern Mediterranean region, including parts of Turkey, Greece, and Cyprus.</p>
<p>It is also found in the Levant, extending into Syria and Lebanon. This plant thrives in coastal areas and rocky habitats, often growing on cliffs or in sandy soils. It is commonly associated with maritime environments and is well-adapted to salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the Mediterranean basin, where it is a characteristic component of coastal vegetation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria adenochaeta was mainly introduced to coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea and the eastern Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, sheltered waters with sandy or muddy substrates. This plant is commonly found in regions with moderate temperatures and sufficient sunlight. Its introduction has been linked to ballast water discharge and accidental transport by ships.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native flora for resources.</p>
