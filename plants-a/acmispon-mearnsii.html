                <h1>Acmispon mearnsii</h1>
<p>Acmispon mearnsii, commonly known as burro's tail, is a low-growing perennial succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that give it a trailing appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and ability to form compact, decorative mats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmispon mearnsii has leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and branched, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a spreading pattern. The flowers are small, yellow, and borne in clusters, with a structure of five petals and stamens, blooming from spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small legume pod that splits open to release small, rounded seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant to anchor itself and access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon mearnsii is primarily native to Arizona.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the desert regions of the state, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It is well adapted to the hot and dry climate of Arizona.</p>
<p>Acmispon mearnsii is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in stabilizing desert ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon mearnsii was mainly introduced to control erosion and as a forage plant in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in revegetation projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. However, its invasive nature has led to its spread beyond intended areas, impacting native vegetation. The plant is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among land managers due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
