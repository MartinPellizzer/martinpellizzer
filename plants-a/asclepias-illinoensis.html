                    <h1>Asclepias illinoensis</h1>
<p>Asclepias illinoensis, commonly known as Illinois milkweed, is a native perennial plant found primarily in the central United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milkweed sap contains latex, which is toxic to some animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies.</p>
<p>Illinois milkweed plays a vital role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat.</p>
