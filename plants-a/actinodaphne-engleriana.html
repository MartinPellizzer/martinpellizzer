                <h1>Actinodaphne engleriana</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne engleriana, commonly known as the Engler's camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces berries that contain a single seed, and its wood is valued for its aromatic properties and durability. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its potential medicinal uses in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne engleriana has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a pale brownish bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in clusters, with greenish-white petals and a fragrant odor, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, ovoid drupe that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne engleriana is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in the eastern and western regions. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments within the understory of dense forests. It is commonly encountered in lowland and montane areas with rich soil and high biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne engleriana was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas where there is high humidity and well-drained soil. This plant has been introduced to several countries in the Pacific, including Hawaii and parts of Australia, as an ornamental or for its medicinal properties. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming an invasive species in certain areas due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are often required to manage its spread and prevent ecological disruption.</p>
