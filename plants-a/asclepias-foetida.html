                    <h1>Asclepias foetida</h1>
<p>Asclepias foetida, commonly known as stinkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny seed pods. It is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is particularly noticeable when the plant is crushed.</p>
<p>Asclepias foetida is an important plant for certain pollinators, though it is generally avoided by most herbivores due to its toxic properties.</p>
