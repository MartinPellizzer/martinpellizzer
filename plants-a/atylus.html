<p>Atylus, commonly known as the starry nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that resemble stars, hence their common name. Atylus species typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce berries that contain toxic compounds. They are native to regions in the Mediterranean and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>Due to their toxicity, they are not commonly cultivated but are occasionally found in wild plant communities.</p>
