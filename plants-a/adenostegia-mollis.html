                <h1>Adenostegia mollis</h1>
<p>Adenostegia mollis, commonly known as the silky broom.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in soft, silvery-gray hairs. Its small, yellow flowers appear in clusters and bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow, leathery, and often have a rough texture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostegia mollis has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a bluish-green color and a smooth texture, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostegia mollis is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and parts of Nevada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant thrives in regions with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. It is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Adenostegia mollis plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostegia mollis was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soils in disturbed or degraded areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to establish quickly. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities, making it a popular choice for landscaping. However, its invasive tendencies can lead to the displacement of native vegetation in certain regions.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to prevent unintended ecological impacts.</p>
