                    <h1>Arachniodes duplicatoserrata</h1>
<p>Arachniodes duplicatoserrata, commonly known as the double-toothed forest fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous fern characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into segments with double-serrate margins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>The leaves are evergreen during the growing season but shed in winter, contributing to the plant's seasonal appearance.</p>
