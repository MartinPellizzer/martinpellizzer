                <h1>Adiantum claussenii</h1>
<p>Adiantum claussenii, commonly known as the California maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum claussenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum claussenii has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure around 10-20 cm in length, displaying a light green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and creeping, with a smooth texture and a pale greenish hue, growing horizontally along the ground. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-yellow in color, appearing in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum claussenii is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the region of the Eastern Cape Province. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forested areas. It is commonly found in mountainous regions with high humidity.</p>
<p>Adiantum claussenii is well adapted to the subtropical climate of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum claussenii was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and parts of Canada. This plant prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its delicate fronds make it a popular choice for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
