<p>Arachne emicans, commonly known as the leaning nettle, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its stems are covered in fine hairs and can exude a mild irritant when touched.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Arachne emicans is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
