The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and attractive foliage.</p>
