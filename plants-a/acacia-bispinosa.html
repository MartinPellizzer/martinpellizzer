                    <h1>Acacia bispinosa</h1>
<p>Acacia bispinosa, commonly known as the two-spined acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are divided into numerous small, feather-like segments. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in hard pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds through the environment.</p>
<p>Acacia bispinosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments.</p>
