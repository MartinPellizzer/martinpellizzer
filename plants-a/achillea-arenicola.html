                <h1>Achillea arenicola</h1>
<p>Achillea arenicola, commonly known as sand yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sand yarrow is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea arenicola has narrow, linear leaves that are typically bluish-gray in color, arranged in a basal rosette, and measure up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, hairy, and have a grayish-green color, growing in a compact, low-growing pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersing by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to sandy soils, helping the plant thrive in coastal and dry environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea arenicola is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>Currently, it is also present in parts of the Middle East and has been introduced to some areas in California, USA. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils and in open, sunny habitats. This species typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea arenicola is considered a species of concern in some regions and may be at risk of decline.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea arenicola is a hardy perennial plant known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity in 2-3 years, and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil, requiring minimal watering once established.</p>
<p>Fertilization should be light in early spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper air circulation and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or sedum can enhance its growth and provide a visually appealing garden arrangement.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea arenicola is a hardy flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both sustenance and shelter. This plant acts as an effective companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its beneficial properties. Additionally, it plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil in coastal and sandy environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it an important ecological asset in coastal ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea arenicola is a flowering plant native to rocky and coastal areas, known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh environments.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it may have potential in local traditional cuisines. In medicinal use, it has been studied for its possible anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity in arid regions and supports pollinators.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and adaptation, often found in ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea arenicola has several varieties and cultivars that are prized for their hardiness and ornamental value, with popular cultivars including 'Achillea arenicola' var. 'Littoral' and 'Achillea arenicola' var. 'Marmara'.</p>
<p>These cultivars often exhibit variations in leaf texture and flower color, enhancing their appeal in gardens. Hybrids of Achillea arenicola are less common but may be developed to improve traits such as cold tolerance and bloom duration. Horticulturally, Achillea arenicola is valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its long-lasting, fluffy flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Its use in rock gardens and coastal landscapes highlights its adaptability and aesthetic contribution to horticultural design.</p>
