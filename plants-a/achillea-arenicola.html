<p>Achillea arenicola, commonly known as sand yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sand yarrow is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
