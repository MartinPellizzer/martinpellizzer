                    <h1>Arenaria dichotoma</h1>
<p>Arenaria dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of tiny, succulent leaves that are adapted to cold and dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its stems are often branched and can spread horizontally, helping it colonize rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Arenaria dichotoma is well-suited to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats.</p>
