<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea laxiflora has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-gray upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and has a light green color, growing in a spreading or upright pattern depending on the environment.
