                        <h1>Abies umbellata</h1>
<p>Abies umbellata, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pyramidal shape, dark green needles, and distinctive cone-like structures that hang in clusters. The tree's bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, while its branches are dense and often droop downward. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>The white fir plays an important role in forest ecosystems and is valued for its timber and ornamental qualities.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies umbellata is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with high altitudes and cool, moist conditions. This species is commonly found in coniferous forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It prefers well-drained soils and is often associated with other cold-tolerant tree species.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies umbellata was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and cool climates, typically in mountainous or high-altitude regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with ample sunlight but can tolerate partial shade. This species is often planted for its ornamental value, including its cone-shaped form and evergreen foliage. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
