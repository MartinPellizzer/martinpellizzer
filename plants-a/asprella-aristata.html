<p>Asprella aristata, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. The plant features small, leathery leaves with a waxy surface, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with five petals and a distinctive, showy appearance.</p>
<p>Asprella aristata is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine ecosystems where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
