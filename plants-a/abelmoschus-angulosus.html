                <h1>Abelmoschus angulosus</h1>
<p>Abelmoschus angulosus, commonly known as the angular okra, is a flowering plant native to Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its spiny, triangular leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that develops from the flower and contains numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Abelmoschus angulosus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some traditional medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus angulosus has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly woody, with a rough, hairy texture and a pale green to reddish-brown color. Its flowers are yellow with a distinctive dark red or purple center, arranged in clusters, and bloom from summer to early autumn, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to dry conditions by storing water and nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus angulosus is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Nigeria, Ghana, and Sudan.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to parts of Asia and the Caribbean, expanding its current distribution. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in lowland areas near rivers and in cultivated fields. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as threatened, habitat loss and agricultural expansion pose potential risks to its conservation status.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus angulosus is a heat-loving plant commonly grown for its edible pods and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, which should be sown directly in warm soil after the last frost, or through cuttings for faster growth. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, typically maturing in 60 to 90 days, depending on climate and care.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with consistent watering, especially during dry periods, but should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Regular fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season, along with pruning to encourage bushier growth, helps maintain its health. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while diseases like powdery mildew can occur in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus angulosus is a plant that provides food for both humans and wildlife, offering edible seeds and leaves that are nutritious and valuable in local cuisines.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies, which help in the reproductive process of the plant and other nearby flora. The plant also acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring crops by improving soil conditions and deterring pests. Additionally, its deep root system helps in preventing soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Abelmoschus angulosus contributes to ecological balance by supporting biodiversity and maintaining healthy soil through natural nutrient cycling.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
