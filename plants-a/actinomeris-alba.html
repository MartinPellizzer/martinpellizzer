                <h1>Actinomeris alba</h1>
<p>Actinomeris alba, commonly known as the white actinomeris, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants such as philodendrons and calla lilies. The plant is characterized by its striking white spatheous inflorescence, which consists of a single spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth surface and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>Actinomeris alba is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique and elegant appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinomeris alba has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface, while the underside is lighter in color; the leaves are medium in size and arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and slightly hairy, with a pale greenish-brown bark that becomes rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, with five petals and numerous stamens; they bloom in spring and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinomeris alba is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and moist, shaded environments. This species thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is often associated with secondary growth areas. It is typically found growing on tree trunks or in the undergrowth of dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a regional endemic plant in parts of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinomeris alba was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. This plant has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California. Its introduction is likely due to natural dispersal through wind or water.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
