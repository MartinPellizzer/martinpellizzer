                    <h1>Artemisia latiloba</h1>
<p>Artemisia latiloba, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that are clustered in branched inflorescences, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, disturbed sites, and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and aromatic properties, it plays a role in both ecological and traditional medicinal contexts.</p>
