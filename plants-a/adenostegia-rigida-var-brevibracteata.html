                    <h1>Adenostegia rigida var. brevibracteata</h1>
<p>Adenostegia rigida var. brevibracteata, commonly known as the narrow-bract adenostegia, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems that are often branched and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish, adapted to attract specific pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize transpiration in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in low-water conditions.</p>
