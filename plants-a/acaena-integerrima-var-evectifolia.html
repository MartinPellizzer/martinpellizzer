<p>Acaena integerrima var. evectifolia, commonly known as the New Zealand brake, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, serrated leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits containing seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often found in coastal and montane environments, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acaena integerrima var. evectifolia has compound leaves that are typically serrated or lobed, arranged alternately along the stem, with sizes ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length, and colors varying from dark green to reddish in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and branched, with a rough, dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spherical heads, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, burr-like structure containing several seeds, which are dispersed by animals that brush against the bristles.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, aiding in water absorption and soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena integerrima var. evectifolia is a shrub native to New Zealand, specifically found on the South Island.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the North and South Islands, where it has been introduced in some areas. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes and coastal dunes. This plant typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as threatened, its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and competition from invasive species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acaena integerrima var. evectifolia is a hardy, low-growing shrub known for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in diverse conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. This plant has a slow growth cycle, often reaching maturity within 2–3 years, and prefers well-drained soil with moderate watering.</p>
<p>Fertilization should be light during the growing season, and pruning is recommended to maintain shape and encourage bushier growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering plants can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support beneficial insect activity.</p>
