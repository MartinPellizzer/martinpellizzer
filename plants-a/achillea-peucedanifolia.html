<p>Achillea peucedanifolia, commonly known as sweet everlasting, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish to white flowers. The plant is known for its aromatic properties and has been used historically in herbal medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, often growing in open, dry habitats.</p>
<p>Its long-lasting flowers make it a popular choice for dried floral arrangements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea peucedanifolia has basal leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged in a rosette formation and ranging in size from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
