                <h1>Achillea peucedanifolia</h1>
<p>Achillea peucedanifolia, commonly known as the European yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. It has a long flowering period, usually from late spring to early autumn, and is known for its aromatic, slightly bitter scent.</p>
<p>Achillea peucedanifolia is also valued for its medicinal properties, traditionally used to treat various ailments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea peucedanifolia has basal, lanceolate leaves that are gray-green in color, with a fuzzy upper surface and a smooth lower surface, arranged in a rosette pattern and measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hollow, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. The flowers are pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their small size and attached bristles.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea peucedanifolia is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, specifically found in parts of southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas such as southern France, Spain, Portugal, and the Iberian Peninsula. It thrives in dry, rocky, or gravelly soils in sunny, open habitats like grasslands and rocky slopes. This plant typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is classified as a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea peucedanifolia is a hardy perennial plant known for its fragrant, finely divided leaves and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing established clumps, with the best results achieved in early spring or fall. This plant has a biennial growth cycle, though it often behaves as a short-lived perennial in temperate climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its compact form. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help repel pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea peucedanifolia is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds and foliage for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. Additionally, its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It also contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and supporting biodiversity in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea peucedanifolia is a lesser-known member of the Asteraceae family, primarily valued for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It has been traditionally used in herbal medicine to treat ailments such as respiratory issues and skin conditions due to its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial compounds. While not as widely cultivated for culinary use as other members of the genus, it may have niche applications in regional cuisines. Its ornamental value also contributes to its role in horticulture and landscape design.</p>
<p>However, its industrial and economic significance remains limited compared to more commercially viable plants.</p>
