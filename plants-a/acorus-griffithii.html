                <h1>Acorus griffithii</h1>
<p>Acorus griffithii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sweetflag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a distinctive aromatic scent. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Acorus griffithii plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus griffithii has broad, sword-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly reddish in color, growing from the base of the leaves. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spadix surrounded by a pale yellow spathe, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed berry that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by water and wind.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming dense underground networks that help the plant spread and anchor itself in wet, muddy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus griffithii is primarily native to the Indian subcontinent, including countries such as India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist and swampy areas, as well as along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant thrives in wetland habitats and is often associated with freshwater environments. It is also present in parts of Southeast Asia, including Bangladesh and Myanmar.</p>
<p>Acorus griffithii is known for its aromatic rhizomes and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus griffithii was mainly introduced to aquatic and wetland environments where it can thrive in shallow, still water.</p>
<p>It is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of rivers and streams. This plant is known for its ability to tolerate a wide range of water conditions, including varying levels of nutrients and light. Its presence can alter the local ecosystem by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and affecting water chemistry.</p>
<p>However, it can also become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
