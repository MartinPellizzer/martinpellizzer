                <h1>Adenophora chionantha</h1>
<p>Adenophora chionantha, commonly known as the snowbell, is a perennial herb native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy white flowers that resemble bells, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are opposite and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Adenophora chionantha is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often used in gardens and naturalized areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora chionantha has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slightly hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. Its flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in umbels, and display a pale blue to white color, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora chionantha is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, including the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Tibet.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 meters. This species is commonly found in alpine meadows, rocky slopes, and forest margins where the climate is cool and moist. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat, which includes low temperatures and strong sunlight.</p>
<p>Adenophora chionantha is an important part of the local flora and is often associated with other high-altitude plant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora chionantha was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive white flowers and hardy nature. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It is commonly found in forest margins, along stream banks, and in open grassy areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
