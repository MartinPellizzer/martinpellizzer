<p>Aspidium biaristatum, commonly known as the two-veined water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia clustered in sori.</p>
<p>Aspidium biaristatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in water gardens or as a ground cover in shaded landscapes.</p>
