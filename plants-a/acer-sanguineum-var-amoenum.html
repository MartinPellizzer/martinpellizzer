                <h1>Acer sanguineum var. amoenum</h1>
<p>Acer sanguineum var. amoenum, commonly known as the Weeping Cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pendulous branches that create a weeping appearance, with flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to red or orange-red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage, floral display, and striking autumn coloration.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer sanguineum var. amoenum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a vibrant red or crimson color during the fall.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. It produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, appearing in early spring with a pale pink to white color, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule, which disperses by wind, allowing the seeds to travel several meters from the parent plant.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to well-drained soils and providing stability to the plant.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer sanguineum var. amoenum is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it is now found in cultivation in botanical gardens and private collections worldwide. It thrives in temperate climates, preferring well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, often in forested or rocky environments.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted natural habitat and limited wild populations, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer sanguineum var. amoenum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red stems and delicate foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. This species has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering.</p>
<p>Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or sage can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer sanguineum var. amoenum is a decorative shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the landscape. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity of the ecosystem by supporting a wide range of flora and fauna.</p>
