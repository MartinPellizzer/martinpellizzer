                <h1>Adhatoda genistiformis</h1>
<p>Adhatoda genistiformis, commonly known as the Indian coral tree, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in dry, open areas.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Adhatoda genistiformis make it a notable species in both horticulture and traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda genistiformis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green with red stamens, arranged in umbellate clusters, blooming during the rainy season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda genistiformis is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to specific areas in these regions, often in fragmented habitats. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in forest understories or along stream banks. This species typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Adhatoda genistiformis is considered to be of conservation concern, with some populations classified as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda genistiformis is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, known for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter method being more reliable for faster growth. The plant has a warm-season growth cycle, thriving in tropical and subtropical climates, and it blooms throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourages new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and improve its overall health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adhatoda genistiformis is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its colorful flowers, aiding in the reproduction of other plants in the ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other species to enhance soil health and promote mutual growth. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil and supporting the growth of surrounding vegetation.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Adhatoda genistiformis is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, known for its various uses and applications.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, it has been used to treat respiratory ailments and as a tonic due to its medicinal properties.
