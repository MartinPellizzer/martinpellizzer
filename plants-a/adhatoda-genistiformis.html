                <h1>Adhatoda genistiformis</h1>
<p>Adhatoda genistiformis, commonly known as the Indian banyan or the white banyan, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant is often found growing as a vine or shrub, and it can reach significant heights under suitable conditions. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and medicinal contexts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda genistiformis has leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green to brownish bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a creeping growth pattern. The flowers are yellow, with five petals arranged in a raceme, blooming from April to June, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, providing anchorage and aiding in water and nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda genistiformis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, well-drained soils. This plant is commonly distributed in the Indian subcontinent, particularly in the states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Assam. It is also present in the Philippines and parts of Myanmar.</p>
<p>Its native range extends to some areas of southern China and Malaysia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda genistiformis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and potential medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several countries across Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Africa. The plant spreads primarily through seed dispersal by wind and water, which contributes to its establishment in new areas. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and riverbanks.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential varies depending on local environmental conditions and management practices.</p>
