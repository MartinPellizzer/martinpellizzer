                <h1>Aconitum acutum</h1>
<p>Aconitum acutum, commonly known as the acute aconite, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>Aconitum acutum contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum acutum has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, reaching up to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, often reddish-brown in color, with a straight growth pattern and a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in a dense spike, with spurred petals and a complex structure that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies; they bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces follicles as its fruit, containing small, flat seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients and surviving harsh conditions.</p>
