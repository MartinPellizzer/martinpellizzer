                <h1>Aegilops aristata</h1>
<p>Aegilops aristata, commonly known as the slender wild rye, is a grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with bristle-tipped florets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Aegilops aristata is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops aristata has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blade-shaped, linear, and slightly pointed, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and smooth, with a light green color, growing in a clump or loose tuft. Its flowers are small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, dry, three-lobed caryopsis, with seeds dispersed by wind due to their light weight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or disturbed soils.</p>
