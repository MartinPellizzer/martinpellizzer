<p>It is characterized by its hairy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are alternate, hence the variety name, and are lance-shaped with a rough texture.</p>
<p>It is valued in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties, though its use is often limited due to its toxicity.</p>
