                    <h1>Allium bodeanum</h1>
<p>Allium bodeanum, commonly known as the Bodean onion, is a bulbous plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces bulbs that are typically harvested for culinary use, though they are less common in global markets compared to other allium species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
