                    <h1>Andropogon rufus var. auricomus</h1>
<p>Andropogon rufus var. auricomus, commonly known as the golden bluestem, is a variant of the bluestem grass native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its golden-yellow inflorescence, which distinguishes it from the more typical reddish color of the standard *Andropogon rufus*. The plant is a warm-season grass that thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairie and open woodland habitats. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, with a rough texture, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
