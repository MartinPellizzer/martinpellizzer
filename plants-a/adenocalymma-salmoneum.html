                <h1>Adenocalymma salmoneum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma salmoneum, commonly known as the red-flowered pincushion, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny pods. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma salmoneum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma salmoneum has simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are usually glossy green in color, with a slightly wavy margin and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical and smooth, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma salmoneum is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal regions of this area. This plant thrives in sandy soils along the shoreline. It is often associated with dune ecosystems and is adapted to saline conditions.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to specific areas within the southeastern part of Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma salmoneum was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in regions with moderate to high rainfall. This plant has shown adaptability to different soil types, which contributes to its successful establishment in non-native areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor its spread and assess its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
