                <h1>Acrostichum galvinii</h1>
<p>Acrostichum galvinii, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, bright yellow fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are typically pinnate, with a smooth, leathery texture.</p>
<p>Acrostichum galvinii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum galvinii has large, elongated, leathery leaves that are typically sword-shaped, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and can grow up to 3 meters in length, with a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, dark brown bark that has a fibrous texture and grows in a clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers clustered in spikes, which bloom during the late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind, and the plant has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum galvinii is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and mangrove swamps, where it thrives in humid, saline environments. This fern is also present in parts of Central America, such as Costa Rica and Panama. It grows along riverbanks and in wetlands, often forming dense stands that provide habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to tropical and subtropical regions with high moisture levels and rich, organic soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum galvinii was mainly introduced to disturbed coastal areas and wetlands, where it thrives in saline and brackish environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mangrove swamps and tidal flats, often competing with native vegetation. This plant has been reported in several regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. Its introduction is often associated with human activities such as coastal development and land reclamation.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems, altering local biodiversity.</p>
