<p>Aralia hispida, commonly known as the rough aralia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with a distinctive rough texture due to the presence of small, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, wooded areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shade gardens and naturalized landscapes.</p>
