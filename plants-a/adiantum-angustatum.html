                <h1>Adiantum angustatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum angustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum angustatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum angustatum has slender, upright stems that are smooth and green, with a growth pattern that is typically clumping or creeping.</p>
<p>Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and closely arranged in a bipinnate pattern, with a dark green color and a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-producing fern, and thus lacks floral structures, color, blooming period, or pollination method. Its fruit and seeds are not applicable, as it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum angustatum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and moist, shaded environments. This fern thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often seen growing on rocks or tree trunks in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the region due to specific ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum angustatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and stream banks. This plant has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California. It is often seen growing in clusters along the edges of wetlands and near mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
