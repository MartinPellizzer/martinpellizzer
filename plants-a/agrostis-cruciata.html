<p>Agrostis cruciata, commonly known as the cross-leaved grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences make it a notable species in ecological studies.</p>
