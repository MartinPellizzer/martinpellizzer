<p>Alisma plantago-aquatica var. decumbens, commonly known as the creeping water plant, is a wetland herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters at the water's surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in shallow water environments.</p>
<p>This species is an important component of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
