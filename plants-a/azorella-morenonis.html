<p>Azorella morenonis, commonly known as the Andean cushion plant, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its dense, low-growing, cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. Azorella morenonis is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other alpine flora.</p>
