                <h1>Acer italum var. tomentellum</h1>
<p>Acer italum var. tomentellum, commonly known as the tomentellum maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely hairy, grayish-green leaves that turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras with two papery wings. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rocky or dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage and autumn coloration.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer italum var. tomentellum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“8 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. The flowers are inconspicuous, with small, greenish-yellow petals, and they bloom in early spring, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to stabilize the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer italum var. tomentellum is a rare variant of the European maple, native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy, particularly in the Apennines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in central and southern Italy, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. This plant typically grows in sunny, open habitats such as forest edges and rocky slopes. It is found at altitudes ranging from 600 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat fragmentation, it is considered endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer italum var. tomentellum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal traits. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry spells. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigolds can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer italum var. tomentellum is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in mixed vegetation, enhancing biodiversity in its surroundings. Its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions.</p>
