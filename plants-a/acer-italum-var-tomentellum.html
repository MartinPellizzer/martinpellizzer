<p>Acer italum var. tomentellum, commonly known as the Italian maple with a tomentose habit, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly pubescence, giving it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The tree produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming more fissured with age.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens for its unique foliage and seasonal color changes.</p>
