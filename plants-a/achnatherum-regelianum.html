                    <h1>Achnatherum regelianum</h1>
<p>Achnatherum regelianum, commonly known as the Tibetan needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the high altitudes of Asia, particularly in regions like Tibet, China, and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, dry conditions with well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it withstand harsh climates.</p>
<p>Achnatherum regelianum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
