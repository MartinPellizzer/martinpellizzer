                <h1>Achnatherum regelianum</h1>
<p>Achnatherum regelianum, commonly known as the Tibetan needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the high altitudes of Asia, particularly in regions like Tibet, China, and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, dry conditions with well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it withstand harsh climates.</p>
<p>Achnatherum regelianum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum regelianum has grass-like leaves that are narrow, flat, and linear in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a length typically ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and grows in a clump-forming pattern, with a smooth, grayish-brown texture and a light-colored bark. The flowers are small, spike-like inflorescences with spikelets containing two to three florets, appearing in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small, dry, two-lobed achene that is dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum regelianum is primarily native to Central Asia, including regions such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and parts of southern Russia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in steppe and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. This grass species is also present in parts of northern China and western Mongolia. It is adapted to tolerate drought and moderate temperatures, making it a common component of grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the temperate and continental climates of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum regelianum was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in states like Utah, Nevada, and Arizona.</p>
<p>It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is commonly associated with disturbed areas such as roadsides and grazing lands. This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive nature, it is sometimes used for erosion control in certain areas.</p>
