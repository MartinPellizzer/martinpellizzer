                <h1>Achillea flava</h1>
<p>Achillea flava, commonly known as yellow archangel, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Achillea flava is also known for its medicinal properties, historically used to treat wounds and inflammation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea flava has compound, basal leaves that are spoon-shaped (spatulate) with a grayish-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown color, growing from the base to form a flowering stalk. The flowers are yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters (umbels), blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene enclosed in a pappus of silky hairs, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea flava is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly in regions of Spain, Portugal, and southern France.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends into parts of North Africa and the Mediterranean islands. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and open woodlands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Achillea flava is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, indicating it is not currently at risk of extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea flava is a perennial plant known for its yellow flowers and hardy nature, commonly grown in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining the plant's vigor. The growth cycle of Achillea flava involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is relatively drought-tolerant. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring can promote healthy growth, while pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
