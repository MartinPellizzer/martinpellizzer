                <h1>Achillea flava</h1>
<p>Achillea flava, commonly known as the yellow archangel, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. It is perennial and can grow up to 60 centimeters tall.</p>
<p>Its common name is derived from the Greek myth of Achilles, who was said to have used the plant to treat wounds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea flava has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, dark green on top, and silvery white underneath, with a rough texture and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, branching, and have a reddish-brown color with a slightly hairy texture. The flowers are arranged in flat, disk-like clusters called capitula, with yellow ray florets and a yellow disk, blooming from June to August and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea flava is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, including countries such as Spain, Portugal, France, and Italy.</p>
<p>Its current distribution extends to parts of North Africa and the Canary Islands, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. It is commonly found in grasslands, open woodlands, and rocky slopes, often in areas with low moisture retention. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Achillea flava is considered vulnerable in some regions, though it is not currently listed as endangered globally.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea flava is a hardy perennial plant known for its bright yellow flowers and ability to thrive in various conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the root clumps, with the latter method often yielding faster results. The growth cycle of Achillea flava involves a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding overwatering to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with plants like lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
