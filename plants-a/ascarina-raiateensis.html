<p>Ascarina raiateensis, commonly known as the Tahitian fan-palm, is a flowering plant native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that form a distinctive fan shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spadices, followed by oval-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Ascarina raiateensis is adapted to coastal and humid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
