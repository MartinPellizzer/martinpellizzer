                    <h1>Asparagus lowei</h1>
<p>Asparagus lowei, commonly known as the desert asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by edible, cone-like berries. Asparagus lowei is adapted to survive in extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary strategies for thriving in nutrient-poor, sandy soils.</p>
