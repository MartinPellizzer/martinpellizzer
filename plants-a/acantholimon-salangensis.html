<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of complex structures such as roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and often having spore-producing structures. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is distinguished by their floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes plants with specialized adaptations such as salt tolerance and a variety of flower forms. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, a family of flowering plants commonly known as the leadplant family, characterized by their often blue or purple flowers and medicinal properties. Its genus is Acantholimon, a group of flowering plants typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, known for their succulent leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon salangensis, a specific type of plant native to certain regions, known for its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon salangensis is primarily native to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and central areas. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or gravelly soils. It is commonly associated with alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Afghanistan's diverse landscape.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon salangensis was mainly introduced to areas with temperate to cold climates, typically found in alpine or subalpine regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous environments. This plant is native to Central Asia, particularly the Himalayas and surrounding regions. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range for ornamental purposes or ecological restoration.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited due to specific environmental requirements.</p>
