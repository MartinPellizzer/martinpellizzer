<p>Avena sterilis f. abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf oat, is a naturally occurring variant of the oat species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shorter stature and reduced inflorescence compared to the typical oat plant. This form is often found in arid or disturbed environments where it exhibits drought tolerance. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and agricultural studies.</p>
