<p>It is a perennial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its preferred habitat.</p>
