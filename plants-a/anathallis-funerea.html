                    <h1>Anathallis funerea</h1>
<p>Anathallis funerea, commonly known as the black ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black, elongated petals and sepals, which give it its striking appearance. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are pollinated by specific species of bees.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and threats from deforestation, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas.</p>
