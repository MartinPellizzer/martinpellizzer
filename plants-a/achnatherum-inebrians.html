                <h1>Achnatherum inebrians</h1>
<p>Achnatherum inebrians, commonly known as the drunken grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often appear to sway in the wind, giving it its common name. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Achnatherum inebrians is adapted to survive in harsh environments, making it a resilient and hardy plant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum inebrians has narrow, linear leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a basal rosette, and range in length from 10 to 30 centimeters.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown surface, and grows in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or purple florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum inebrians is primarily native to China North-Central, China South-Central, Inner Mongolia, Mongolia, Qinghai, Tibet, and Xinjiang.</p>
<p>This grass species is commonly found in alpine and semi-arid regions across these areas. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in open landscapes and on mountain slopes. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climate conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum inebrians was mainly introduced to North America through human activities such as agriculture and land development.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides, fields, and along fence rows. This plant has adapted well to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both dry and moist conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a persistent weed in many regions.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered highly invasive and does not typically outcompete native vegetation.</p>
