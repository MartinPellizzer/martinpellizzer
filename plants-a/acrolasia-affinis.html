                <h1>Acrolasia affinis</h1>
<p>Acrolasia affinis, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, deciduous shrub that typically grows in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its leaves are alternate and oval-shaped, with a rough texture.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its milky sap, which is toxic and used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrolasia affinis has compound, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that remains relatively unbranched until maturity. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green with four petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils by forming associations with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia affinis is primarily native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Cameroon, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rainforests and moist woodland habitats. The plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often associated with the understory vegetation in these dense forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in parts of its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia affinis was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as horticultural trade and landscape gardening.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of the United States and Europe. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in open areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread and minimize ecological impacts.</p>
