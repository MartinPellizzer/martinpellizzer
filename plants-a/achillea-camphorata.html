                <h1>Achillea camphorata</h1>
<p>Achillea camphorata, commonly known as mountain yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features a robust root system and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped inflorescences. The plant has finely divided, feathery leaves that are aromatic and often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Its name is derived from the Greek mythological figure Achilles, who was said to have used the plant for healing wounds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea camphorata has narrow, linear to lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat woody at the base, with a rough, grayish-brown bark and a growth pattern that is typically clumping or spreading. The flowers are small, clustered in flat-topped umbels, with white petals and yellow centers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea camphorata is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, specifically found in parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited, with populations primarily found in isolated areas of southern France, Italy, and Spain. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea camphorata is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in several regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea camphorata is a hardy perennial known for its aromatic foliage and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
