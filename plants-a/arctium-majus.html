                    <h1>Arctium majus</h1>
<p>Arctium majus, commonly known as the greater burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces purple to brown flowers that develop into spiny, bur-like fruits, which are adapted for seed dispersal by attaching to animals. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Arctium majus is commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows.</p>
