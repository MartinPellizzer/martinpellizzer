                    <h1>Ancistrocladus korupensis</h1>
<p>Ancistrocladus korupensis, commonly known as the Korup ancistrocladus, is a rare shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Cameroon.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces tiny yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing several seeds. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in the dense understory of its native forest ecosystems.</p>
