                <h1>Adenacanthus rubroglandulosus</h1>
<p>Adenacanthus rubroglandulosus, commonly known as the red glandular adenacanthus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and bright yellow to orange composite flowers. Native to southern Africa, this plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its structure includes a stout, branching stem with opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, reddish glands.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenacanthus rubroglandulosus has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with prominent glandular structures on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenacanthus rubroglandulosus is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater and Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical environments, often in coastal areas or along riverbanks. It is adapted to sandy or loamy soils and thrives in humid climates with moderate rainfall.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to these specific islands, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenacanthus rubroglandulosus was mainly introduced to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. Its spread is particularly rapid in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to control its population and protect native biodiversity.</p>
