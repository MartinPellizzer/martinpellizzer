<p>Alloispermum scabrifolium, commonly known as the rough-leafed aloes, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color and covered with a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal watering.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
