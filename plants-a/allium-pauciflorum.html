<p>Allium pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rounded bulbs and clusters of pale blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 15â€“30 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and mild garlic-like scent.</p>
