                <h1>Achillea gracilis</h1>
<p>Achillea gracilis, commonly known as slender yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its slender stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Achillea gracilis is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea gracilis has slender, upright stems that are green and slightly hairy, growing in a clumping pattern.</p>
<p>Its leaves are narrow, linear, and slightly curled, arranged alternately along the stem, with a grayish-green color and a rough texture. The flowers are small, clustered in flat-topped umbels, typically white or pale yellow, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and establish in various environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea gracilis is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is now distributed in similar regions, often in disturbed or open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. This species thrives in temperate climates and is typically found at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Achillea gracilis is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea gracilis is a low-growing perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of tiny, yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds indoors in late winter. This plant has a growth cycle that begins with new growth in spring, flowering in late summer, and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or rust in damp conditions, making it a good companion plant for echinacea or lavender.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea gracilis is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, which rely on its flowers and seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. Additionally, its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing slopes and preventing water runoff.</p>
<p>Achillea gracilis also contributes to biodiversity by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea gracilis is a versatile plant known for its historical and contemporary uses across various fields.</p>
<p>In culinary applications, it is sometimes used as a seasoning due to its aromatic leaves. Medicinally, it has been traditionally used to treat ailments such as digestive issues and skin conditions. Industrially, its fibrous stems have been utilized in the production of paper and textiles.</p>
