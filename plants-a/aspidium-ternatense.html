<p>Aspidium ternatense, commonly known as the Ternate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, slender fronds that are often submerged, with sporangia clustered at the tips of the fronds. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize aquatic sediments.</p>
<p>Aspidium ternatense plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
