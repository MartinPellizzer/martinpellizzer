                    <h1>Aloe spiralis var. pentagona</h1>
<p>Aloe spiralis var. pentagona, commonly known as the spiral aloe, is a unique succulent plant characterized by its tightly spiraled rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically narrow and pointed, forming a compact, spiral pattern that gives the plant its distinctive appearance. It is native to the arid regions of South Africa, where it thrives in well-draining soil and full sunlight. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-orange flowers during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and striking form, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
