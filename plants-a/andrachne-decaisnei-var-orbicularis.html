                    <h1>Andrachne decaisnei var. orbicularis</h1>
<p>Andrachne decaisnei var. orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular sandmat, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, with small, orbicular (rounded) leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
