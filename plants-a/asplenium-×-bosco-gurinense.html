                    <h1>Asplenium × bosco-gurinense</h1>
<p>Asplenium × bosco-gurinense, commonly known as the Bosco-Gurinense spleenwort, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features dark green, leathery fronds with a serrated or toothed margin, and it produces spores in clustered, stalked clusters called sori. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including regions of India, Nepal, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
