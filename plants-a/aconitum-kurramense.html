                <h1>Aconitum kurramense</h1>
<p>Aconitum kurramense, commonly known as the Kurram aconite, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of Pakistan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear showy, blue to violet flowers arranged in a spire-like inflorescence. The plant has palmately compound leaves with lobed segments, and its roots contain toxic alkaloids, making it a potentially dangerous species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum kurramense has compound leaves that are palmately arranged, with lanceolate to ovate leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and smooth, with a grayish-brown bark that is slightly furrowed, growing in a straight, unbranched pattern. The flowers are blue to violet in color, arranged in dense, tall spikes, and consist of five petal-like sepals and two smaller petals; they bloom in late summer to early autumn and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, adapted for anchoring the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum kurramense is primarily native to Pakistan, West Himalaya.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of northern Pakistan, particularly in the Kurram Valley. This species thrives in high-altitude environments with cool and moist climates. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters.</p>
<p>The plant is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum kurramense was mainly introduced to the data as a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Pakistan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and is typically found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes. The distribution data highlights its limited range, emphasizing its ecological significance and conservation status. Due to its rarity, it is often of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>However, there is limited information on its introduction outside its native habitat.</p>
