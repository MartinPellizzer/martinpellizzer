                <h1>Adinandra retusa</h1>
<p>Adinandra retusa, commonly known as the smooth adinandra, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often glabrous or nearly so. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, woody capsules containing seeds. It is typically found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal uses.</p>
<p>The tree's botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra retusa has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with smooth, pale brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a straight, upright pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra retusa is primarily native to China Southeast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of this area. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments within forest understories. It is often associated with limestone soils and can be found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within southeastern China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra retusa was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. This plant is commonly used in horticulture for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and small, fragrant flowers. It has been introduced to several regions beyond its native range for landscaping purposes.</p>
<p>However, its spread can sometimes lead to ecological impacts in non-native environments.</p>
