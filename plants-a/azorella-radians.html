                    <h1>Azorella radians</h1>
<p>Azorella radians, commonly known as the "Pineapple of the Andes," is a striking member of the Apiaceae family, native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit, with dark green, fleshy leaves that form a compact rosette. It produces small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate contrast to its otherwise dark foliage. Azorella radians is well adapted to harsh, cold environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a notable species in alpine ecosystems.</p>
