<p>Anathallis corynophora, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate, and often pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species.</p>
