<p>Aira flexuosa subsp.</p>
<p>uliginosa, commonly known as the bog fescue, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marsh habitats. It is characterized by its slender, often tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in peat bogs and other moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance, it plays a key role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
