<p>Assaracus capax, commonly known as the broad-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers clustered in racemes, which bloom in spring. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to efficiently absorb moisture from the soil.</p>
<p>Assaracus capax is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited rainfall.</p>
