<p>Aegilops tauschii subsp.</p>
<p>tauschii, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a wild relative of modern wheat that plays a significant role in plant genetics. It is native to the Middle East and Central Asia and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and spike-like inflorescence.</p>
<p>This species is diploid, with a genome size that has contributed to its importance in wheat breeding programs. Its genetic material is used to improve wheat varieties for traits such as disease resistance and yield.</p>
<p>The plant also serves as a valuable resource for studying the evolution of the Triticeae tribe.</p>
