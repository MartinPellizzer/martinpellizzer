                <h1>Adenia craibii</h1>
<p>Adenia craibii, commonly known as the mountain adenia, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its woody stem and large, palmate leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers with five petals and a distinctive crown of filaments. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia craibii has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they vary in size from 5 to 15 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown to grey in color, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern, often twining around supports. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the wet season, and they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that turns red when mature, containing several seeds dispersed by birds and mammals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, providing anchorage and aiding in water and nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia craibii is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the wetter regions of the Cape York Peninsula and the surrounding areas. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. It is commonly associated with the understorey of lowland and coastal rainforests.</p>
<p>Adenia craibii is a rare and endangered species, with a limited geographic range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia craibii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a climbing shrub native to Australia and is commonly found in coastal and subcoastal regions. The plant has been reported in several regions of New Zealand, including the North Island and parts of the South Island. It thrives in moist, sunny conditions and is often seen growing along cliffs and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
