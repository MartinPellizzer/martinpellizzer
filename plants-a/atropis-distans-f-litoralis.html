                    <h1>Atropis distans f. litoralis</h1>
<p>Atropis distans f. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal atropis, is a rare variant of the atropis species adapted to coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and salt-tolerant foliage, which allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky coastal soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This form is particularly sensitive to environmental changes, making it an indicator species for coastal ecosystem health.</p>
