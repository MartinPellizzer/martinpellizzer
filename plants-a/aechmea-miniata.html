<p>Aechmea miniata, commonly known as the miniature pineapple bromeliad, is a compact, epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant produces striking, short-lived inflorescences with vibrant red flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its foliage is often variegated with white and green markings, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Aechmea miniata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
