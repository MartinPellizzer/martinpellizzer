                <h1>Aechmea miniata</h1>
<p>Aechmea miniata, commonly known as the miniature pineapple bromeliad, is a compact, epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant produces striking, short-lived inflorescences with vibrant red flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its foliage is often variegated with white and green markings, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Aechmea miniata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea miniata has rosette-shaped leaves that are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in a compact circle, typically ranging from 10 to 30 cm in length, with a bluish-green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>It possesses a short, underground stem with a fibrous, dark brown bark that grows from the base of the rosette. The plant produces inflorescences with bright red bracts that enclose small, white flowers, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in its epiphytic or terrestrial habitat.</p>
