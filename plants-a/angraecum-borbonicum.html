<p>Angraecum borbonicum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive star-shaped appearance, which bloom at night. Angraecum borbonicum is known for its long, slender petals and a highly specialized nectar spur that attracts specific pollinators, such as moths.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth.</p>
