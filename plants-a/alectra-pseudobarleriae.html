                    <h1>Alectra pseudobarleriae</h1>
<p>Alectra pseudobarleriae, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, serving as a defense mechanism. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Alectra pseudobarleriae plays a role in supporting local insect populations, particularly certain species of butterflies.</p>
