                <h1>Acinodendron tunicatum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron tunicatum, commonly known as the tunicate acacia, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are often small and clustered, producing a distinctive, fragrant scent.</p>
<p>Acinodendron tunicatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential ecological and medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron tunicatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. The flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round drupe that splits open to release smooth, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron tunicatum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. The plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is often associated with shaded undergrowth. It is also present in parts of the Indian subcontinent, particularly in northeastern India and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for specific ecological conditions, its distribution is relatively restricted to these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron tunicatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands for its ornamental value and potential use in horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has been reported in countries such as Hawaii, Guam, and parts of Southeast Asia. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal have led to its establishment in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains under study due to limited long-term data.</p>
