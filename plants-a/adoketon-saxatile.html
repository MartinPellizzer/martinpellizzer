                <h1>Adoketon saxatile</h1>
<p>Adoketon saxatile, commonly known as the saxifrage, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Crassulaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pink. Native to rocky and alpine environments, this plant is well adapted to harsh, arid conditions. It often grows in crevices or on stone surfaces, where it can retain moisture efficiently.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adoketon saxatile has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring between 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, woody, and covered with a rough, fissured bark that is light brown in color, growing in a shrub-like form. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal, and the seeds are tiny, elongated, and have a winged structure for aid in flight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adoketon saxatile is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Cape Province and surrounding areas. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and mountainous regions. It is also present in parts of Namibia and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>Adoketon saxatile is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, with periods of drought and seasonal rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adoketon saxatile was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening, landscaping, and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in sunny, open environments. The plant has a rapid growth rate and can outcompete native species, leading to ecological concerns in invaded areas. Its seeds are easily dispersed by wind, water, and animals, contributing to its wide distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in several regions outside its native range.</p>
