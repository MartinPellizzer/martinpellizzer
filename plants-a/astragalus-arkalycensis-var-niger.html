<p>Astragalus arkalycensis var. niger, commonly known as black-horned milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive black, hairy stipules that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense, globular inflorescences, and it produces elongated pods containing small, kidney-shaped seeds.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in arid ecosystems and its potential for use in restoration projects.</p>
