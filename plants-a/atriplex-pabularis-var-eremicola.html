<p>Atriplex pabularis var. eremicola, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in desert scrub and washes.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
