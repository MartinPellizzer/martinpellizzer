                <h1>Adiantum erectum</h1>
<p>Adiantum erectum, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of polypody fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, slender fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with small, clustered sori on the underside.</p>
<p>Adiantum erectum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ease of cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum erectum has fronds that are pinnately divided, with a triangular shape and a dark green color, arranged in a loose rosette at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching from the base. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a dark brown capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum erectum is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, wooded areas such as forests, swamps, and stream banks. This fern thrives in shaded environments and is often seen growing on rocks or in the understory of hardwood forests. Its range extends from New Brunswick and Nova Scotia in Canada down to Florida in the United States.</p>
<p>It is also present in the Appalachian Mountains and other regions with similar humid, temperate climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum erectum was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. This fern is often cultivated in gardens due to its ornamental value and ease of care. It has been reported in several states including New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
