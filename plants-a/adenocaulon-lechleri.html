                <h1>Adenocaulon lechleri</h1>
<p>Adenocaulon lechleri, commonly known as the rubber tree or caucho tree, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its woody stem and opposite leaves. The plant is notable for its latex-producing capabilities, which have been historically harvested for rubber production. Its flowers are typically blue or violet, and it thrives in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocaulon lechleri has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, typically ranging from 1 to 3 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and branched, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocaulon lechleri is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems. This species is adapted to the cool, moist conditions typical of these mountainous areas. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within the Andes, where it grows on rocky slopes and in shaded, humid areas.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, Adenocaulon lechleri is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocaulon lechleri was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in disturbed areas such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along stream banks. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered a non-native species that can outcompete local flora.</p>
