                    <h1>Arceuthobium douglasii</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium douglasii, commonly known as the Douglas's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is characterized by its yellow-orange, thread-like stems that缠绕 around host plants such as Douglas fir. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and relies on wind for pollination. It is native to western North America and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
