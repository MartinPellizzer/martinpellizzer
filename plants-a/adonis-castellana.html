                <h1>Adonis castellana</h1>
<p>Adonis castellana, commonly known as the rock jasmine, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, sunny environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis castellana has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and has a light green color, growing from the base of the plant. Its flowers are yellow, with a tubular structure and five petals, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the rocky and arid environments where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis castellana is primarily native to southern Europe, including countries such as Spain, France, Italy, and parts of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and mountainous regions, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. This plant thrives in Mediterranean climates and is often associated with open habitats like slopes and grasslands. It is also known to occur in some parts of North Africa, such as Morocco and Algeria.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the western Palearctic region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis castellana was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, particularly in the Mediterranean Basin.</p>
<p>It has been spread through human activities such as horticulture and accidental transport. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it adaptable to various environments. It is commonly found in disturbed areas, roadsides, and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
