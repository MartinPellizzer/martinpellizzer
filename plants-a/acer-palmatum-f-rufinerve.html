                <h1>Acer palmatum f. rufinerve</h1>
<p>Acer palmatum f. rufinerve, commonly known as the red-veined maple, is a distinctive cultivar of the Japanese maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red to orange veins that contrast with its dark green foliage. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, with a finely toothed margin. This plant thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, preferring cooler climates.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum f. rufinerve has palmate leaves that are finely divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 10â€“20 cm in diameter, displaying vibrant red or crimson hues in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows in a bushy, upright form. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, arranged in clustered inflorescences, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum f. rufinerve is a cultivar of the Japanese maple known for its distinctive red veins.</p>
<p>Native to Japan, it originally grew in the mountainous regions of Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu. Today, it is widely cultivated in gardens and parks across temperate regions worldwide, including North America and Europe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade, typically found at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>The species is not considered threatened in the wild, but its cultivation is often limited to ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum f. rufinerve is a compact, ornamental maple known for its vibrant red veins and delicate foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal traits. This plant has a slow growth cycle, often reaching maturity within 5 to 10 years, making it ideal for smaller gardens.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining, slightly acidic soil and requires consistent watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the plant and remove dead wood are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or hostas can enhance its aesthetic appeal while promoting a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>
