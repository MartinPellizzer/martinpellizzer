                        <h1>Acalypha stipulacea</h1>
<p>Acalypha stipulacea, commonly known as the velvetleaf or sacred plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties, and the plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Acalypha stipulacea is often found in disturbed habitats and is adaptable to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha stipulacea is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with rainforests or secondary growth habitats. It is also native to parts of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii and Guam.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other tropical regions around the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha stipulacea was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit.</p>
<p>It was initially cultivated for its vibrant leaves and potential use in landscaping. However, it has since become an invasive species, spreading rapidly and outcompeting native vegetation. The plant's adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in disturbed areas contribute to its invasive nature.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and prevent further ecological impact.</p>
