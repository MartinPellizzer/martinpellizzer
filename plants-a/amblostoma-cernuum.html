                    <h1>Amblostoma cernuum</h1>
<p>Amblostoma cernuum, commonly known as the nodding twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family (Orchidaceae).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that hang downward, giving it its common name. The plant lacks true leaves, instead having reduced, scale-like structures called bracts. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands.</p>
<p>Amblostoma cernuum relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids.</p>
