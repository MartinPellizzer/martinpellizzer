                        <h1>Abrodictyum clathratum</h1>
<p>Abrodictyum clathratum, commonly known as the glassy orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, translucent or glassy appearance, which is due to the intricate, lattice-like structure of its petals and sepals. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a delicate, almost ethereal look.</p>
<p>Abrodictyum clathratum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in specialized greenhouses due to its specific care requirements.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrodictyum clathratum is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. This plant thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils along the Atlantic and Indian Ocean coasts. It is commonly found in rocky outcrops and open vegetation types.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific regions within South Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrodictyum clathratum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically in regions with a subtropical or tropical environment.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, open woodlands, and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is known for its showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. Its introduction has been associated with both ornamental horticulture and accidental spread through human activity.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it has been introduced.</p>
