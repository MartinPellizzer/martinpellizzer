                <h1>Acosta pelia</h1>
<p>Acosta pelia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with pale green leaves and a single, elongated flower that often resembles a ghostly figure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a specific balance of light and moisture to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological sensitivity, Acosta pelia is considered an endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta pelia has leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, often creeping or climbing, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that is smooth when young and becomes slightly rough with age. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale yellow, consisting of four petals and numerous stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta pelia is primarily native to South America, specifically in regions of Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, often growing in humid, shaded environments. This plant is typically associated with rainforests and is often found in association with other epiphytic species. It thrives in areas with high humidity and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta pelia was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions due to its adaptability and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils. The plant has been introduced to several countries in South America, particularly in regions with high biodiversity. Its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native species, raising concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread into non-target environments.</p>
