                <h1>Acorus nilghirensis</h1>
<p>Acorus nilghirensis, commonly known as the Nilgiri arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous stem system that allows it to spread vegetatively. The plant features broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in wetland environments. It produces small, spadix-like inflorescences that are typically greenish or yellowish in color.</p>
<p>Acorus nilghirensis is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native wetlands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus nilghirensis has broad, sword-shaped leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter green underneath, arranged in a fan-like pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, smooth, and somewhat fibrous, with a pale yellowish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, arranged in a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed berry that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by water and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming a network that helps the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus nilghirensis is primarily native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>This species is found in the mountainous regions of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as streamsides and forest floors. The plant is adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of this region.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within the Western Ghats, reflecting its ecological specialization.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus nilghirensis was mainly introduced to wetland and riparian habitats, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in marshes, along the edges of lakes, and in slow-moving streams. This plant is known for its ability to tolerate a wide range of water depths and soil conditions. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various aquatic ecosystems across its range.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-invasive species in most regions where it is found.</p>
