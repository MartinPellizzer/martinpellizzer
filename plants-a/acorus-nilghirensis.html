                <h1>Acorus nilghirensis</h1>
<p>Acorus nilghirensis, commonly known as the Nilgiri arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of the Western Ghats in India.</p>
<p>It features broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spadices, typical of the Aroid family. It thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is considered an important component of the region's aquatic ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus nilghirensis has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a fan shape, typically ranging from 20 to 40 cm in length with a pale green to yellowish color.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and erect, with a smooth, dark brown bark that grows in a single, unbranched pattern. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense, spiral-like clusters during the summer months, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a spathaceous capsule that releases small, dark brown seeds, which are dispersed by water or wind.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming a dense network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus nilghirensis is a rare aquatic plant native to the Western Ghats of southern India.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Nilgiri and Cardamom Hills regions. It thrives in freshwater wetlands, marshes, and swampy areas with rich organic soil. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,200 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Acorus nilghirensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acorus nilghirensis is a unique aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of rhizomes or by planting rhizome fragments in shallow water. The growth cycle of Acorus nilghirensis is perennial, with active growth during spring and summer, followed by dormancy in colder months.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy or loamy soil with consistent watering to maintain wet conditions. Fertilization with a balanced aquatic fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning dead foliage helps maintain appearance.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or fungal infections in poor conditions, and it pairs well with other water plants like water lilies for a natural aquatic garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acorus nilghirensis is a wetland plant that provides food and shelter for various aquatic and semi-aquatic wildlife.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as insects and birds with its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a natural filter, helping to improve water quality by absorbing pollutants. Its dense growth also aids in erosion control by stabilizing soil along water bodies.</p>
<p>Additionally, it serves as a companion plant for other wetland species, enhancing biodiversity in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acorus nilghirensis is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary practices, it has been traditionally employed in local medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties. Its rhizomes may hold potential for industrial applications, though research in this area remains limited. Culturally, the plant is valued in certain regions for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and as a symbol of resilience in natural landscapes.</p>
<p>Overall, Acorus nilghirensis plays a modest but important role in both ecological systems and traditional knowledge.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acorus nilghirensis has several varieties and cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aureus' and 'Variegatus', which are known for their striking yellow or variegated foliage. While few natural hybrids of Acorus nilghirensis are documented, it is occasionally crossed with other Acorus species to create new cultivars with enhanced traits. These plants hold horticultural importance as they are used in water gardens and as ground cover in moist, shady areas.</p>
<p>Their unique appearance and resilience make them valuable additions to both residential and public landscapes.</p>
