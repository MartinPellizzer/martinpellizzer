                    <h1>Amygdalus communis var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Amygdalus communis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf almond, is a variety of the common almond tree native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and small white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible nuts, though they are typically smaller and less commercially valuable than those of the standard almond variety. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a temperate climate with a distinct winter dormancy period.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and floral display.</p>
