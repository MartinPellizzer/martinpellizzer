<p>Asplenium loherianum, commonly known as the Loher's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rock surfaces or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Asplenium loherianum is well adapted to humid, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
