<p>Acacia wickhamii subsp.</p>
<p>cassitera, commonly known as the Cassitera acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, pale green phyllodes that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which attract various pollinators. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is also valued for its ecological role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife.</p>
