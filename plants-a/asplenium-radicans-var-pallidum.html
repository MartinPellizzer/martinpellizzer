                    <h1>Asplenium radicans var. pallidum</h1>
<p>Asplenium radicans var. pallidum, commonly known as the pale maidenhair fern, is a varietal form of the common maidenhair fern.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that are typically shorter and more compact than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in rocky or shaded woodland areas.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a humid indoor setting.</p>
