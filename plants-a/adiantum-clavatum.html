                    <h1>Adiantum clavatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum clavatum, commonly known as the shuttlecock fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are bi-lobed and resemble the shape of a shuttlecock, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps it anchor to the soil and absorb moisture.</p>
<p>Adiantum clavatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant, feathery appearance.</p>
