<p>Adenophora maximowicziana, commonly known as the Korean bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora maximowicziana has oval-shaped, opposite leaves that are medium green in color, with a smooth texture and a slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>Its stems are erect, hairy, and have a grayish-brown bark, growing in a bushy pattern. The flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale blue petals and yellow stamens, blooming in summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora maximowicziana is primarily native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the central and northern parts. This species thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often seen in woodland and meadow habitats. It is a perennial herb known for its attractive blue to purple flowers.</p>
<p>The plant is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its ecological role in native ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora maximowicziana was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, particularly in East Asia, where it has become naturalized in parts of China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas and along stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental value due to its showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. It has also been introduced to some parts of North America as a horticultural plant.</p>
<p>However, its spread in non-native regions is limited and does not pose a significant ecological threat.</p>
