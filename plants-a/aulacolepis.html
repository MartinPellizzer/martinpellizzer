                    <h1>Aulacolepis</h1>
<p>Aulacolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a genus of aquatic ferns belonging to the family Onocleaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it attaches to submerged or floating objects. Aulacolepis has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across the water surface.</p>
<p>Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
