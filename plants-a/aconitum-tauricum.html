                <h1>Aconitum tauricum</h1>
<p>Aconitum tauricum, commonly known as the Caucasian monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum tauricum has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically reaching up to 20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat hairy, and has a rough, dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense racemes, with showy petals and a spurred shape, blooming in late summer and attracting insects for pollination. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, tuberous, and form a dense network underground, helping the plant to store nutrients and survive harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum tauricum is primarily native to Austria, Germany, Italy, and the NW Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous regions and alpine environments across these areas. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and often grows in rocky or forested habitats. It is known for its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a regional endemic species in parts of Central and Southeastern Europe.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum tauricum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically found in mountainous or forested regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking blue or purple flowers. The plant is commonly used in landscape design to add visual interest to shaded garden spaces. It prefers cool temperatures and can tolerate light frosts, making it suitable for cooler regions.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that Aconitum tauricum is toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
