                <h1>Acer angustilobum</h1>
<p>Acer angustilobum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree produces small, red samaras that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and urban environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer angustilobum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a finely toothed margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small to medium-sized tree with a rounded crown. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruits are samaras, or "whips," with a single seed enclosed in a winged structure, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the tree and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer angustilobum is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, specifically found in the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Tennessee, North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in mixed hardwood forests and along stream banks. This species typically grows at elevations between 600 and 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Acer angustilobum is listed as a species of concern in several states, indicating a need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer angustilobum is a deciduous tree known for its distinctive narrow leaves and vibrant fall color.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture levels, requiring regular watering during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-tolerant plants like ferns or hostas can enhance its ornamental value in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer angustilobum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity through its canopy and root systems. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape and improving water retention.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in carbon sequestration, enhancing the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer angustilobum is a deciduous tree native to North America, known for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>While it is not typically used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties, such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In industrial contexts, its wood is valued for its strength and fine grain, making it suitable for furniture and cabinetry. Culturally, it is often planted in gardens for its aesthetic appeal, symbolizing resilience and seasonal change.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer angustilobum plays a significant role in both environmental and horticultural contexts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer angustilobum has several popular cultivars such as 'Autumn Flame' and 'Orange Queen', which are prized for their vibrant fall color and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is also involved in the creation of hybrids with other maple species, contributing to the diversity of ornamental maples in horticulture. These cultivars and hybrids are widely used in landscaping due to their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its ability to provide seasonal interest and its role in expanding the range of maple species available for cultivation.</p>
<p>Its popularity continues to grow among gardeners seeking unique and visually striking trees.</p>
