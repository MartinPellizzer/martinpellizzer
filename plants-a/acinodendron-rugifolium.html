                <h1>Acinodendron rugifolium</h1>
<p>Acinodendron rugifolium, commonly known as the roughleaf acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a subtle fragrance. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Acinodendron rugifolium is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron rugifolium has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a rough, rugose texture and a dark green color on the upper surface, contrasting with a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender, woody, and has a smooth, reddish-brown bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, with a simple structure and a brief blooming period in late spring, pollinated primarily by wind. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron rugifolium is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, lowland forests and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and well-drained soil. It is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron rugifolium was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, pastures, and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including land clearing and agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
