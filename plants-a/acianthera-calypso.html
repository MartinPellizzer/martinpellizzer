                <h1>Acianthera calypso</h1>
<p>Acianthera calypso, commonly known as the Calypso orchid, is a species of orchid native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and purple, often with a distinctive lip petal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera calypso has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure around 2-4 cm in length, with a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale greenish-brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and a prominent yellow-green spur, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera calypso is primarily native to Ecuador.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often within cloud forests. The plant is known for its small, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely restricted to specific microhabitats in Ecuador's biodiversity-rich ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera calypso was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as horticultural trade and intentional planting.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in shaded, moist environments like forests and gardens. The plant's ability to adapt to various soil types contributes to its successful establishment in non-native areas. Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in many regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, its introduction may pose ecological risks if it becomes invasive in local ecosystems.</p>
