                <h1>Aconitum bhutanobulbilliferum</h1>
<p>Aconitum bhutanobulbilliferum, commonly known as the Bhutan bulbilliferous monkshood, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Bhutan and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy underside. It produces small, club-shaped structures called bulbilli that contain seeds.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in moist, shaded habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum bhutanobulbilliferum has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5 to 10 cm in length, with a deep green color and a slightly pubescent surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, dark brown bark, growing to a height of up to 1.5 meters. Its flowers are blue to purple in color, with showy, spurred petals and a complex structure that facilitates pollination by bees and other insects, blooming from July to August. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, adapted for anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum bhutanobulbilliferum is primarily native to the East Himalaya and Assam.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of northeastern India, particularly in the states of Assam and parts of Sikkim. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist climates. The species is commonly associated with alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum bhutanobulbilliferum was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments, making it suitable for forest understories or garden borders. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking blue or purple flowers. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful handling as it contains toxic alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals.</p>
