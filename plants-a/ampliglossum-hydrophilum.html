                    <h1>Ampliglossum hydrophilum</h1>
<p>Ampliglossum hydrophilum, commonly known as waterleaf, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, adapted to retain moisture in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in marshy areas, contributing to wetland ecosystem health.</p>
<p>Ampliglossum hydrophilum is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams.</p>
