                    <h1>Achnatherum clandestinum</h1>
<p>Achnatherum clandestinum, commonly known as the hidden needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact, tufted growth habit, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Achnatherum clandestinum plays a vital role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats.</p>
