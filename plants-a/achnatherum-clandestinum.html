                <h1>Achnatherum clandestinum</h1>
<p>Achnatherum clandestinum, commonly known as the hidden needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact, tufted growth habit, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Achnatherum clandestinum plays a vital role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum clandestinum has leaves that are narrow, linear, and grass-like in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is typically clump-forming. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences composed of small, greenish-brown spikelets, which bloom in early summer and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that contains minute seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and feathery structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in dry, open habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum clandestinum is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central and western North America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the United States, particularly in states such as Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico. This grass species thrives in rocky soils and open habitats, often growing in desert grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It is also present in parts of southern Canada, including Alberta and Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into northern Mexico, where it is adapted to similar dry and harsh environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum clandestinum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed grasslands.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high precipitation and full sun exposure. This plant is often found in the western United States, particularly in states like California, Oregon, and Nevada. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including land development and agriculture.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in some ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
