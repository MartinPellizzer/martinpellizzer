                        <h1>Acantholimon quinquelobum var. curviflorum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon quinquelobum var. curviflorum, commonly known as the curlyflower sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and silver-gray foliage. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acantholimon quinquelobum var. curviflorum belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and some green algae, characterized by their complex cellular structures and photosynthetic capabilities. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes horsetails and their relatives, known for their primitive features and vascular systems. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species, characterized by their diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes species with distinctive floral morphology and often show adaptations to arid environments. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, a family of flowering plants commonly known as the leadwort family, characterized by their often showy flowers and medicinal properties. Its genus is Acantholimon, a genus of flowering plants typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, known for their succulent leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon quinquelobum, a specific plant within the genus Acantholimon, distinguished by its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
