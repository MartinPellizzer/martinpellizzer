                    <h1>Astragalus lacei</h1>
<p>Astragalus lacei, commonly known as the lacey milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Astragalus lacei is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>
