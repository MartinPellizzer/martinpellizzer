                        <h1>Acaulimalva purdiaei</h1>
<p>Acaulimalva purdiaei, commonly known as the Purdia's mallows, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a soft, fuzzy texture, and the stems are often hairy.</p>
<p>Acaulimalva purdiaei is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
