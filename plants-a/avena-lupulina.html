                    <h1>Avena lupulina</h1>
<p>Avena lupulina, commonly known as the "hops oat," is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce both male and female flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically hairy, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it is often found growing in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Avena lupulina is closely related to the cultivated hop plant, Humulus lupulus, and shares some similar ecological and botanical traits.</p>
