                <h1>Acinodendron undatum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron undatum, commonly known as the African velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron undatum has alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the dry season; they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron undatum is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal regions of the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky coastal areas and is often associated with dune vegetation. It is commonly found in the fynbos biome, which is characterized by its unique plant diversity.</p>
<p>Acinodendron undatum is a low-growing shrub that plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron undatum was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the eastern regions, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats, including grasslands and forest margins. The plant is considered invasive in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor and control its spread to prevent further ecological disruption.</p>
