                <h1>Achillea densissima</h1>
<p>Achillea densissima, commonly known as narrow-leaved yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its aromatic foliage and long-lasting blooms make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and ecological landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea densissima has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, light green bark, and grows in a compact, bushy pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense flat-topped umbels, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea densissima is a flowering plant native to the western United States, specifically found in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas within its native range, though it is less common outside of these regions. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands, slopes, and open woodlands. This species typically grows at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea densissima is considered a species of concern and is listed as threatened or endangered in some states.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea densissima is a hardy perennial plant known for its dense, fern-like foliage and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that begins with new growth in spring, flowering in late summer, and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. For optimal growth, apply a balanced fertilizer in early spring and prune back old foliage after flowering. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with aromatic herbs like lavender or rosemary can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea densissima is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, which contribute to the health of the ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its dense foliage and root structure. It also plays a role in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea densissima offers ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health through organic matter accumulation.</p>
