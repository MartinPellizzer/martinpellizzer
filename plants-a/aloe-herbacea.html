<p>Aloe herbacea, commonly known as the desert aloe, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, spiky leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers on tall, branched stems, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that has been used for its soothing properties.</p>
<p>Aloe herbacea is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient and low-maintenance plant for cultivation.</p>
