                <h1>Adenosepalum nummularium</h1>
<p>Adenosepalum nummularium, commonly known as the silverleaf adenosepalum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects light and reduces water loss. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating adaptability to harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in low-water landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosepalum nummularium has small, circular leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, with a waxy, silver-green color and a leathery texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, greenish-gray bark that grows from the base upwards. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers with five petals, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosepalum nummularium is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in lowland rainforests and is sometimes encountered in secondary growth areas. It is also known to occur in parts of the Indian subcontinent, including India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to humid, warm climates with high rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosepalum nummularium was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and open areas, often spreading along roadsides and in urban landscapes. This plant has shown adaptability to various climatic conditions, allowing it to thrive in both temperate and subtropical regions. Its rapid growth and ability to reproduce vegetatively contribute to its invasive potential in non-native areas.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems is still being studied due to its relatively recent introduction.</p>
