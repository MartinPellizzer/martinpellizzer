<p>Apoclada arenicola, commonly known as the sand flatworm, is a species of planarian found in coastal and marine environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the phylum Platyhelminthes and is characterized by its flat, ribbon-like body. This organism is typically found in sandy substrates, where it plays a role in nutrient cycling. Apoclada arenicola lacks a true circulatory system and relies on diffusion for gas exchange.</p>
<p>Its simple anatomy reflects its adaptation to a free-living, aquatic lifestyle.</p>
