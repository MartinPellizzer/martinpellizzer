<p>Acinopetala chontalensis, commonly known as the Chontal mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the cloud forests of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale green to white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip, which is a key feature in orchid taxonomy. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or among mossy rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species.</p>
