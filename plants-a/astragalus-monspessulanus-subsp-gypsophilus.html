                    <h1>Astragalus monspessulanus subsp. gypsophilus</h1>
<p>Astragalus monspessulanus subsp.</p>
<p>gypsophilus, commonly known as the gypsum milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, perennial habit and produces small, yellow to greenish flowers clustered in globular inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found in rocky or gypsum-rich habitats. Its leaves are pinnate, with numerous small leaflets, and it has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its adaptation to extreme environments and its role in stabilizing soil in arid landscapes.</p>
