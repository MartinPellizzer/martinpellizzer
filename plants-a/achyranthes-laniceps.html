                <h1>Achyranthes laniceps</h1>
<p>Achyranthes laniceps, commonly known as the hairy knotweed, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, hairy stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically borne in the upper leaf axils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape, and often covered with fine hairs.</p>
<p>Achyranthes laniceps is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes laniceps has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with greenish-white petals and stamen, blooming during the summer months, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
