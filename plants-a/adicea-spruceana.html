                <h1>Adicea spruceana</h1>
<p>Adicea spruceana, commonly known as the spruceleaf adicea, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands.</p>
<p>Adicea spruceana is valued for its ornamental foliage and has limited use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea spruceana has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside; the leaves are typically 2â€“5 cm in length and arranged along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in loose inflorescences, with pale yellow petals and a prominent central stamen; they bloom in late spring to early summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea spruceana is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>It grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks. This plant is commonly found in areas with rich, acidic soils. Its distribution extends from New York to North Carolina, with some populations in Tennessee and Virginia.</p>
<p>It is a rare and often overlooked member of the Apiaceae family in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea spruceana was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a potential weed in some areas. The plant spreads through seeds dispersed by wind and water, leading to its establishment in moist, disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
