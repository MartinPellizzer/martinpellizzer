<p>Astragalus intermixtus, commonly known as the mixed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and rocky slopes. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to reddish-purple flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Astragalus intermixtus is also known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.</p>
