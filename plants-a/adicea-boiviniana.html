                <h1>Adicea boiviniana</h1>
<p>Adicea boiviniana, commonly known as the Boivin's adicea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, pale yellow flowers and hairy, ovate leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the rainforests of Madagascar. It is known for its unique morphology and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this endangered species from habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea boiviniana has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, white to pale pink, and clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soils in which the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea boiviniana is primarily native to the tropical regions of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern part of the island, particularly in humid forests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in areas with high rainfall and warm temperatures. It is often associated with rocky soils and can be found in elevations ranging from sea level to approximately 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Madagascar.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea boiviniana was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers.</p>
<p>It was first documented in France in the early 20th century and has since spread to other parts of Europe. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. It has been reported in several countries including Italy, Spain, and Portugal.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential remains under study due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas.</p>
