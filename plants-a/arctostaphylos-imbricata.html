                    <h1>Arctostaphylos imbricata</h1>
<p>Arctostaphylos imbricata, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by edible acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers.</p>
<p>Arctostaphylos imbricata is also valued for its ecological importance and is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
