                <h1>Adenophora communis var. lamarckii</h1>
<p>Adenophora communis var. lamarckii, commonly known as the Lamarck's bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora communis var. lamarckii has elliptical to ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth upper surface and a slightly hairy underside, typically ranging from 3 to 8 cm in length and 1 to 3 cm in width, and are usually a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are clustered in inflorescences, with tubular corollas that are pale blue to violet in color, blooming from July to September, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora communis var. lamarckii is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia, particularly China, where it is found in the northeastern regions.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Korea and Japan, although its range has been reduced due to habitat loss. This species thrives in moist, temperate environments such as forests and mountain meadows. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat degradation, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenophora communis var. lamarckii is a hardy perennial known for its showy blue-violet flowers and delicate foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or division of mature rhizomes, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. This plant has a biennial growth cycle, often flowering in its second year before dying back, though it may reseed itself in favorable conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, but is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its vigor, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by slugs and powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or coneflower can enhance its growth and attract beneficial pollinators.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
