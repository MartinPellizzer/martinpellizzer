                <h1>Acronia cutucuensis</h1>
<p>Acronia cutucuensis, commonly known as the Cutucu acronia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, lowland areas and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, often with a velvety texture.</p>
<p>Acronia cutucuensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia cutucuensis has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are white with five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia cutucuensis is primarily native to the humid lowland rainforests of northeastern South America.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Venezuela, Colombia, and parts of Ecuador. This plant thrives in warm, moist environments with high humidity and abundant rainfall. It is typically found in the understory of tropical forests, where it receives indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within the Amazon Basin and adjacent areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia cutucuensis was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soil, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high sunlight exposure and moderate to high rainfall. This plant is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges. Its introduction has been primarily due to human activity, including landscaping and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native flora.</p>
