                <h1>Acronema refugicola</h1>
<p>Acronema refugicola, commonly known as the mountain gentian, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often branched and erect.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acronema refugicola is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronema refugicola has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that has a slightly pubescent texture. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers with four petals, blooming in early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema refugicola is primarily native to Nepal.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and central parts. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments within forests and shrublands. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats that provide the necessary conditions for its growth.</p>
<p>Acronema refugicola is a rare species with a restricted range within Nepal.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema refugicola was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded habitats, typically found in forest understories.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate temperatures and high humidity, making it common in temperate and subtropical climates. The plant is often found in association with other shade-tolerant species, particularly in disturbed or secondary forest growth. Its introduction is often linked to human activities such as gardening and horticultural trade.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been reported in several regions outside its native range, raising concerns about its potential ecological impact.</p>
