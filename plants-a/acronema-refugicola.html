                    <h1>Acronema refugicola</h1>
<p>Acronema refugicola, commonly known as the mountain gentian, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often branched and erect.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acronema refugicola is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
