                <h1>Achyranthes cylindrica</h1>
<p>Achyranthes cylindrica, commonly known as the round-stemmed cowherb, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>It is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in disturbed areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes cylindrica has compound leaves that are opposite in arrangement, with each leaflet being ovate to lanceolate in shape, ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, and typically have a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical and slightly hairy, with a brownish color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and are usually greenish-yellow in color, blooming during the summer months, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a cylindrical, dehiscent capsule that contains numerous small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes cylindrica is primarily native to South and Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of China, Japan, and Indonesia. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and riverbanks. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity.</p>
<p>Its native range extends to some areas of the Pacific Islands as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes cylindrica was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, cylindrical seed pods.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized and is now found in various habitats, including disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant spreads primarily through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water. It is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its ability to colonize disturbed areas quickly.</p>
<p>However, it is not currently listed as an invasive species in New Zealand.</p>
