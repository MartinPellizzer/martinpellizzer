                <h1>Adipera corymbosa</h1>
<p>Adipera corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered starflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Onagraceae, which includes species such as willows and evening primroses. The plant is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale pink. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>Adipera corymbosa thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adipera corymbosa has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, slightly woody texture and a reddish-brown color, growing in a straight, upright pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in corymbs, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adipera corymbosa is primarily native to South America, specifically found in regions of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It thrives in the subtropical and tropical climates of these areas, often growing in moist, shaded environments within the understorey of forests. This plant is commonly associated with the Atlantic Forest biome, where it contributes to the biodiversity of the region. It is typically found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Adipera corymbosa plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting local wildlife and contributing to forest structure.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adipera corymbosa was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have raised concerns among conservationists.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread and prevent further ecological damage.</p>
