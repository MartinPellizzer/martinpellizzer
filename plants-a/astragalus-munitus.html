                    <h1>Astragalus munitus</h1>
<p>Astragalus munitus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria.</p>
<p>Astragalus munitus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens.</p>
