                    <h1>Asclepias gonocarpos</h1>
<p>Asclepias gonocarpos, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a hairy, upright stem that can grow up to 2 meters tall, with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slight pubescence. The plant produces clusters of yellow-orange flowers with distinctive, horn-like structures called corona, which are characteristic of the Asclepias genus. Its milkweed sap contains latex, which is toxic to some animals but serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>This species is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing food for its larvae.</p>
