                <h1>Achyranthes coynei</h1>
<p>Achyranthes coynei, commonly known as the Indian spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in small, capsule-like structures that burst open to disperse seeds.</p>
<p>Achyranthes coynei is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes coynei has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually 5-10 cm long and 2-4 cm wide, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a smooth, slightly woody texture and a reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in spikes, blooming from July to September, and are primarily wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-valved capsule that disperses seeds by wind, with each seed having a small, winged appendage.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, aiding in the plant's ability to thrive in dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes coynei is primarily native to India.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southern and eastern regions of the country. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as wastelands and rocky areas. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to specific ecological zones within India.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes coynei was mainly introduced to agricultural areas and disturbed sites in India.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in cultivated fields, roadsides, and waste lands. The plant has been reported in several states including Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded with human activities and agricultural expansion.</p>
