                <h1>Adenandra glandulosa</h1>
<p>Adenandra glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular adenandra, is a species of flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are leathery and covered with small glands, which contribute to its unique botanical appearance.</p>
<p>Adenandra glandulosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra glandulosa has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and vary in size from 2 to 6 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a somewhat branched structure. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra glandulosa is primarily native to the eastern and southeastern regions of South Africa, including the provinces of KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape, and parts of Mpumalanga.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and mountainous areas, growing in moist, well-drained soils. This species is often associated with forest margins, rocky outcrops, and coastal dunes. It thrives in mild, temperate climates with high humidity.</p>
<p>Adenandra glandulosa is a valuable component of the local flora, contributing to biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra glandulosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species. The plant spreads through seeds dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the potential ecological risks associated with non-native plant species.</p>
