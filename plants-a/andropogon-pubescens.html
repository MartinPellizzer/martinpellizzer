<p>Andropogon pubescens, commonly known as hairy bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade.
