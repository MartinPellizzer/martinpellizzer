                    <h1>Agave cremnophila</h1>
<p>Agave cremnophila, commonly known as the Sierra Madre agave, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spire-like rosette of blue-green, fleshy leaves that are often adorned with white or grayish markings. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing clusters of yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>
