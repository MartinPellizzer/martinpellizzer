                <h1>Acer longipes var. chengbuense</h1>
<p>Acer longipes var. chengbuense, commonly known as the Chengbu maple, is a rare variant of the long-footed maple native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that are typically lobed and have a vibrant green color during the growing season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange samaras in the fall. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer longipes var. chengbuense has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in corymbs, with yellowish-green sepals and red stamens, blooming in early spring, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer longipes var. chengbuense is a rare variant of the winged elm, native to the mountainous regions of western China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Qinling and Dabie Mountains. It thrives in temperate forests with moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in mixed deciduous-coniferous forests. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation and habitat fragmentation, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer longipes var. chengbuense is a rare and ornamental maple species that thrives in temperate climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. The growth cycle of this plant includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by active growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning should focus on shaping and removing dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer longipes var. chengbuense is a unique tree species that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, playing a vital role in maintaining local biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and supporting the growth of other plant species. The tree also contributes to erosion control due to its extensive root system, which helps bind the soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing habitat for a range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer longipes var. chengbuense is a rare and endemic plant species primarily found in specific regions of China, known for its unique ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties, such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In terms of industrial and economic value, it contributes to biodiversity conservation and may support local ecotourism initiatives. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions, representing the resilience of native flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, further research is needed to fully understand its applications and potential benefits.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer longipes var. chengbuense has several notable cultivars, including 'Carnegie' and 'Carnegie Compact,' which are prized for their vibrant fall colors and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>It has also been used in hybridization with other maple species, producing unique varieties that exhibit enhanced ornamental traits. These hybrids often display improved cold hardiness and extended foliage color, making them popular in horticultural settings. The species holds significant horticultural importance due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids contribute to the diversity of maple trees in gardens and public landscapes.</p>
