<p>Androrchis × pseudoanatolica, commonly known as the Anatolian orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Turkey.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that display a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, preferring cool, moist environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming clumps of foliage and flowering stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
