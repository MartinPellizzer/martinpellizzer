                <h1>Aechmea retusa</h1>
<p>Aechmea retusa, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant's foliage is often adorned with vibrant, spiky bracts that can range in color from red to orange, adding to its ornamental appeal. Aechmea retusa thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil or a suitable substrate.</p>
<p>Its unique structure and colorful display make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea retusa has rosette-shaped leaves that are wide, strap-like, and dark green with a waxy texture, arranged in a tight spiral at the base.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, instead having a short, thick, and fibrous base that resembles a pseudostem. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains numerous seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, aiding in water absorption and anchoring the plant in its environment.</p>
