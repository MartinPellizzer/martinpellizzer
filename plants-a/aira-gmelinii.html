<p>Aira gmelinii, commonly known as the meadow grass or slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and wetlands, often forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Aira gmelinii is also valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens.</p>
