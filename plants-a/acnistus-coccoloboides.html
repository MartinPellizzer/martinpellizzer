                <h1>Acnistus coccoloboides</h1>
<p>Acnistus coccoloboides, commonly known as the creeping nettle.</p>
<p>This plant is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is known for its stinging hairs, similar to those found in true nettles.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus coccoloboides has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are woody and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing upright with a bushy habit. The flowers are small, greenish-white, clustered in panicles, and bloom in late spring to early summer; they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release three winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus coccoloboides is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is also found in Central America, extending from southern Mexico through Panama. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. It is commonly associated with coastal areas and is sometimes found in mangrove swamps.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other tropical regions outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus coccoloboides was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It has been documented in coastal areas and disturbed sites, often thriving in sandy or loose soils. The plant is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It spreads primarily through seeds dispersed by wind, water, and human activities.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among land managers due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
