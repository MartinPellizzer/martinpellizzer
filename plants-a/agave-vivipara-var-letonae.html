                    <h1>Agave vivipara var. letonae</h1>
<p>Agave vivipara var. letonae, commonly known as the Mexican button agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming structure, with thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-gray in color. The plant produces offsets, or "pups," at its base, which is a key feature of its viviparous reproduction. These offsets can be separated and grown independently, making propagation relatively straightforward.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
