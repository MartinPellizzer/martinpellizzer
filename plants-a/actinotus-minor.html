                <h1>Actinotus minor</h1>
<p>Actinotus minor, commonly known as the small bluebell, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Actinotus minor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant spring blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinotus minor has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and has a pale greenish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are clustered in umbels, featuring white petals with a yellow center, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through a mechanical mechanism, dispersing them by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinotus minor is primarily native to New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southeastern regions of the state, particularly in the coastal and mountainous areas. This plant typically grows in sandy or loamy soils and thrives in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It is often seen in open forests and heathlands where the climate is temperate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species in New South Wales.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinotus minor was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal areas of the North Island. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen growing along dunes and cliffs. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to control its population and protect native vegetation.</p>
