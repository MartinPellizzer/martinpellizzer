<p>Adiantum polymorphum, commonly known as the variable maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
