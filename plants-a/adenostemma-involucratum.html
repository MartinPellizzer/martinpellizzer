                <h1>Adenostemma involucratum</h1>
<p>Adenostemma involucratum, commonly known as the hairy false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Adenostemma involucratum is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma involucratum has simple, alternate leaves that are lance-shaped, slightly hairy, and range in color from gray-green to dark green, with a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light green to brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with tubular structures and pink to red hues, blooming in summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma involucratum is primarily native to Bolivia, Brazil Northeast, and Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, savannas, and disturbed soils. The species is well adapted to the warm and humid climate of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its preference for well-drained soils and full sunlight.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma involucratum was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southwestern regions.</p>
<p>It was originally native to Africa and parts of Asia. The plant was introduced as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and flowering. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have made it a concern for local ecosystems.</p>
