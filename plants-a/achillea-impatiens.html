<p>Achillea impatiens is also known for its medicinal properties and historical use in traditional remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea impatiens has basal leaves that are lanceolate, serrated, and have a bluish-green color, arranged in a rosette pattern, with a width of about 1-2 inches.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, with a branching growth pattern that rises from the base. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding dark褐色 disk florets, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption and anchoring the plant.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea impatiens is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in countries like Spain, Italy, and France.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends to parts of North Africa and the Middle East, often found in disturbed or rocky environments. This plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is commonly seen in alpine meadows and grasslands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and limited threats, Achillea impatiens is currently listed as a species of least concern in terms of conservation status.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea impatiens is a hardy perennial known for its vibrant, daisy-like flowers and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the root clumps in early spring. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, blooming in late spring and continuing to flower through summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering. Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering promote bushier growth and extend the blooming period. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper spacing and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or lavender enhances its ornamental value and supports beneficial pollinators.</p>
