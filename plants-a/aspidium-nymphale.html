<p>Aspidium nymphale, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has feather-like fronds that are divided into small, pinnae, giving it a delicate appearance. Its rhizomes help anchor it to substrates and absorb nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Aspidium nymphale plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality maintenance.</p>
