                <h1>Aconitum korshinskyi</h1>
<p>Aconitum korshinskyi, commonly known as the Siberian monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking violet-blue to purple flowers arranged in a tall spire, which bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately divided, dark green leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble those of a fern. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum korshinskyi has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure up to 30 cm in diameter, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and has a smooth, greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petals and a spurs, blooming in summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, adapted for absorbing moisture from the moist, woodland habitats where the plant thrives.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum korshinskyi is primarily native to East European Russia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of the Russian Federation, particularly in the southern and eastern parts. This species thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky soils and meadows. It is well adapted to the cold climate and high altitudes typical of its native range.</p>
<p>The plant is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum korshinskyi was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue-violet flowers and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and naturalized areas in the Pacific Northwest, particularly in Washington and Oregon. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its uncontrolled proliferation.</p>
