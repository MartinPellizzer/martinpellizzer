                    <h1>Anemone narcissiflora f. cinereopilosa</h1>
<p>Anemone narcissiflora f. cinereopilosa, commonly known as the cinereopilosa anemone, is a variant of the common anemone characterized by its unique, pale pink to white flowers with a distinctive, smoky or greyish hue.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a more subdued coloration compared to the typical yellow-centered flowers of the species. The plant is a herbaceous perennial with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its botanical interest lies in its subtle color variation and its role in showcasing the genetic diversity within the Anemone genus.</p>
