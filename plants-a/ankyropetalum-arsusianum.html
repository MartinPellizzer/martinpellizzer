<p>Ankyropetalum arsusianum, commonly known as the silverleaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of silvery-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and conservation areas.</p>
