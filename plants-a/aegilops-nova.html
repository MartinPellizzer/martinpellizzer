                <h1>Aegilops nova</h1>
<p>Aegilops nova, commonly known as the New Zealand wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the tribe Aegilopieae within the grass family Poaceae. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as coastal dunes and grasslands. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences.</p>
<p>Aegilops nova is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops nova has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically linear in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and have a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a light green to slightly reddish-brown color, growing upright with a clumping habit. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, pale green to white florets, blooming in early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry caryopsis, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and small size.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>
