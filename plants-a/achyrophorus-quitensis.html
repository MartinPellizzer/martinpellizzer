                <h1>Achyrophorus quitensis</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus quitensis, commonly known as the Peruvian butter tree, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pale yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces a unique, waxy substance known as "butter," which is used in traditional medicine and as a natural preservative. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Andes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus quitensis has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus quitensis is primarily native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in southern South America.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. This species typically grows in rocky soils and mountainous terrain at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 meters. It is adapted to the cold, dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in association with other alpine flora in these remote and rugged environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus quitensis was mainly introduced to regions with temperate to subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in areas with moderate rainfall and sufficient sunlight. This plant is commonly used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and hardy nature. Its introduction has been noted in several parts of the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts.</p>
