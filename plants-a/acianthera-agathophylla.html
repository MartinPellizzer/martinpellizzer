                    <h1>Acianthera agathophylla</h1>
<p>Acianthera agathophylla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers and its unique ability to grow epiphytically on tree branches without soil. The plant has a slender, unbranched stem and produces small, clustered blooms that are often camouflaged among the foliage. Its leaves are usually small and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Acianthera agathophylla is considered a conservation concern.</p>
