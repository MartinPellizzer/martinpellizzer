<p>Amyema hexameres, commonly known as the six-lobed rock fig, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, round, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Its leaves are leathery, oval-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Amyema hexameres is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions and is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
