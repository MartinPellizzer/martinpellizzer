                    <h1>Artemisia nitrosa</h1>
<p>Artemisia nitrosa, commonly known as tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant contains essential oils, particularly thujone, which contribute to its strong scent and medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its chemical composition, it has been historically used in herbal medicine and as a pest repellent.</p>
