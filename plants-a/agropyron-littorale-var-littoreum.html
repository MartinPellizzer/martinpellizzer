<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize shorelines and tolerate harsh environmental conditions.</p>
