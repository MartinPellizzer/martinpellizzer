<p>Adelobotrys ruokolainenii, commonly known as the Ruokolainen's adelobotrys, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant with delicate, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant is characterized by its unique floral structure, which features specialized nectar-producing glands that attract specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Its botanical study contributes to the understanding of biodiversity in understudied tropical ecosystems.</p>
