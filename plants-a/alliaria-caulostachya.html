                    <h1>Alliaria caulostachya</h1>
<p>Alliaria caulostachya, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features smooth, dark green leaves that are heart-shaped and emit a garlic-like odor when crushed. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by kidney-shaped seed pods. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native plant species and disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
