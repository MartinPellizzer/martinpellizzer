                <h1>Adiantum macrophyllum</h1>
<p>Adiantum macrophyllum, commonly known as the royal fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, graceful fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant features bi-lobed pinnae with a distinctive, almost metallic sheen on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Adiantum macrophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum macrophyllum has fern-like leaves that are broadly triangular in shape, with a feathery appearance, arranged in a bipinnate pattern, and typically measure up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are bright green on the upper surface and pale underneath, with a smooth texture. The plant has a short, unbranched stem that is slender and slightly woody, with a smooth, light brown bark. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in late spring, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a cluster of dry, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous, helping to anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum macrophyllum is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil North, Brazil Northeast, Brazil Southeast, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Galápagos, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Leeward Is., Mexico Central, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Southeast, Mexico Southwest, Nicaragua, Panamá, Peru, Puerto Rico, Suriname, Trinidad-Tobago, Venezuela, and Windward Is.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This fern is particularly widespread in the Neotropical region, inhabiting a variety of habitats such as forests, stream sides, and rocky outcrops. Its adaptability allows it to thrive across a wide range of altitudes and climates within its native distribution.</p>
<p>Adiantum macrophyllum is an important component of the local flora in many of these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum macrophyllum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. The plant has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range, raising concerns among conservationists.</p>
