                <h1>Adnaria brasiliensis</h1>
<p>Adnaria brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant features a slender, upright stem with several leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pink. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>Adnaria brasiliensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria brasiliensis has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lance-shaped leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and are white with yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a spherical capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria brasiliensis is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest region of southeastern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is found in the states of Paran√°, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within these forested regions. It is adapted to the humid climate and rich soil conditions of the Atlantic Forest.</p>
<p>Adnaria brasiliensis is an important part of the local biodiversity and plays a role in the ecosystem of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria brasiliensis was mainly introduced to the Great Lakes region of Africa.</p>
<p>It was introduced through the aquarium trade and subsequently released into the wild. This plant has established itself in freshwater environments, particularly in shallow lakes and slow-moving rivers. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to outcompete native aquatic vegetation.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact is still being studied due to limited data on its spread and effects.</p>
