                    <h1>Aristolochia ju-ju</h1>
<p>Aristolochia ju-ju, commonly known as the African birthwort, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, complex, pipe-shaped flowers that are often greenish or brownish in color. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making it potentially dangerous if ingested. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it has been used in traditional medicine, though its use is highly discouraged due to health risks.</p>
