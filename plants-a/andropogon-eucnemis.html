                    <h1>Andropogon eucnemis</h1>
<p>Andropogon eucnemis, commonly known as inland needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Andropogon eucnemis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
