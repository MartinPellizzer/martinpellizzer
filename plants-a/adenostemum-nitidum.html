                <h1>Adenostemum nitidum</h1>
<p>Adenostemum nitidum, commonly known as the smooth adenostemum, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and related species. The plant is characterized by its smooth, often succulent stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with five petals and a prominent central column.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed habitats and can be invasive in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemum nitidum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly woody with age, and it grows in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with tubular petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the dry season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemum nitidum is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. This plant thrives in open woodlands, grasslands, and rocky outcrops where it can receive adequate sunlight. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in these regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in similar climates outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemum nitidum was mainly introduced to new areas as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, waxy leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>It has since become invasive in several regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant spreads rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind, animals, and water. It is particularly problematic in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a noxious weed in many parts of the world.</p>
