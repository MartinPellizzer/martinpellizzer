                <h1>Adenanthos velutinus</h1>
<p>Adenanthos velutinus, commonly known as the velvet leaf adenanthos, is a small shrub native to southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage that gives it a velvety texture, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, spherical seed pods. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or sandy landscapes.</p>
<p>Adenanthos velutinus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthos velutinus has leaves that are oval to lance-shaped, with a velvety texture and a dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are small, white to pale pink, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom from late autumn to early spring, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos velutinus is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southern and western regions of the state. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils. It is often seen in areas with low rainfall and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Adenanthos velutinus is a member of the Proteaceae family and is known for its attractive, woolly foliage.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos velutinus was mainly introduced to South Australia, where it has become naturalised in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, sandy soils along the coast and in riverine areas. The plant is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides and cleared lands. Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in gardens and introduced to various parts of the state.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns about its potential impact on native vegetation.</p>
