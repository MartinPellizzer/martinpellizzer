                    <h1>Asplenium scolopendrium var. antri-jovis</h1>
<p>Asplenium scolopendrium var. antri-jovis, commonly known as the cave spleenwort, is a fern species that thrives in rocky, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered in dense, compact formations. This variety is typically found growing on limestone or calcareous substrates, often in caves or crevices. Its sporangia are borne on the undersides of the leaves, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to low-light conditions and can survive in humid, nutrient-poor environments.</p>
