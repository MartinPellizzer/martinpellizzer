                <h1>Acianthera bilobulata</h1>
<p>Acianthera bilobulata, commonly known as the two-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces striking, fragrant flowers with a unique two-lobed lip. The plant typically blooms during the summer months, showcasing vivid colors that range from white to pink and purple. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera bilobulata has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and has a light green color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with pale yellow or white petals and a distinctive bilobed lip, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera bilobulata is primarily native to Ecuador.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the cloud forests and humid lowland regions of the country. It thrives in the moist, shaded environments typical of the Andean foothills. The plant is known for its delicate flowers and is often found in secondary growth areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within Ecuador's diverse ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera bilobulata was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, often near forests or along riverbanks. This plant has been introduced to several countries in South America, particularly in Brazil and Peru, where it has established itself in natural ecosystems. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native flora due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, its invasive tendencies require careful monitoring in non-native habitats.</p>
