                    <h1>Anogra pallida var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Anogra pallida var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf ghostflower, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
