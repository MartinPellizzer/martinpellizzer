                    <h1>Alsophila humilis var. pycnophylla</h1>
<p>Alsophila humilis var. pycnophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tree fern, is a variant of the slender tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate, dark green fronds that are narrower than those of the typical variety. The fronds are densely packed, giving the plant a compact appearance, and they can grow up to several meters in length. This variety thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and unique foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture.</p>
