                <h1>Adicea obtusata</h1>
<p>Adicea obtusata, commonly known as the bluntleaf adicea, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap and showy flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, characterized by its thick, woody stems and ovate leaves with rounded tips. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with five petals and a prominent corona, making it visually striking.</p>
<p>Adicea obtusata is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea obtusata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a rounded tip, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are medium-sized, typically 5â€“10 cm in length, and are dark green on top with a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, slightly hairy bark that is light brown in color. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea obtusata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Cameroon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest understories and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and well-drained soils. It is also occasionally reported in parts of Southeast Asia, though its distribution there is less common.</p>
<p>Adicea obtusata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea obtusata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become a weed in some regions, posing a threat to native ecosystems. The plant spreads through seed dispersal and can establish itself in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the potential ecological risks associated with non-native plant species.</p>
