                <h1>Aegilops trispiculata</h1>
<p>Aegilops trispiculata, commonly known as the three-spurred wild rye, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with three prominent spurs on each lemma, giving it its common name. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments.</p>
<p>Aegilops trispiculata is of interest in botanical studies due to its potential for genetic diversity and its role in ecological systems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops trispiculata has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually linear, parallel-veined, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a length ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and smooth, with a greenish hue, growing in dense clumps or tufts. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The fruit is a spikelet containing small, hard grains, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in arid and disturbed environments.</p>
