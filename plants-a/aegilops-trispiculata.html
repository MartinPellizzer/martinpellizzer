<p>Aegilops trispiculata, commonly known as the three-spurred wild rye, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with three prominent spurs on each lemma, giving it its common name. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments.</p>
<p>Aegilops trispiculata is of interest in botanical studies due to its potential for genetic diversity and its role in ecological systems.</p>
