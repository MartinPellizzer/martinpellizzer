<p>Axonopus laxus, commonly known as the slender axonopus, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the soil surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are usually clustered in groups, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like in appearance. Axonopus laxus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands.</p>
<p>It is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes but is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
