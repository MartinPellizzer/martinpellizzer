                <h1>Adinandra grandis</h1>
<p>Adinandra grandis, commonly known as the large-leafed adinandra, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important species. The plant is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits.</p>
<p>Adinandra grandis is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra grandis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and beetles. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor firmly in the soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra grandis is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of this area, particularly in Hubei, Sichuan, and Chongqing provinces. The plant thrives in humid, subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to this specific region in China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra grandis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit. It has been introduced to several countries as a garden plant and for reforestation purposes.</p>
<p>However, its spread can sometimes lead to ecological concerns in non-native environments.</p>
