                <h1>Acrotrema costatum</h1>
<p>Acrotrema costatum, commonly known as the serrated acrotrema, is a rare and delicate lichen species that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae and is characterized by its intricate thallus structure and distinct, serrated margins. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides essential nutrients through photosynthesis. Its growth is often limited to specific microhabitats, making it a valuable indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Acrotrema costatum is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotrema costatum has small, needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally along the stem, with a pale green color and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish bark that grows upright and branching. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers with no petals, appearing in early spring, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release fine, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, helping it anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotrema costatum is primarily native to the East Himalaya, Malaya, Myanmar, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its distribution is closely associated with specific microclimates and soil conditions.</p>
<p>Acrotrema costatum is an important component of the local biodiversity in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotrema costatum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as accidental transport via contaminated soil or equipment.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides, agricultural fields, and urban environments. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and can tolerate a range of environmental conditions. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains largely undocumented.</p>
