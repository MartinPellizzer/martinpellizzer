<p>Acrotrema costatum, commonly known as the serrated acrotrema, is a rare and delicate lichen species that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae and is characterized by its intricate thallus structure and distinct, serrated margins. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides essential nutrients through photosynthesis. Its growth is often limited to specific microhabitats, making it a valuable indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Acrotrema costatum is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
