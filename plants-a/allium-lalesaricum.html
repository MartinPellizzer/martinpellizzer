                    <h1>Allium lalesaricum</h1>
<p>Allium lalesaricum, commonly known as the Lalesarica onion, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Allium genus.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Afghanistan and Tajikistan. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its bulbs are small and often overlooked, but they produce clusters of white or pale purple flowers in the summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Allium lalesaricum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
