                <h1>Acrostichum ovatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum ovatum, commonly known as the broadleaf hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ovatum has large, elongated, leathery leaves that are ovate in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and range in size from 30 to 60 centimeters in length, with a deep green color.</p>
<p>Its stems are upright, with a smooth, dark brown bark that grows in a clumping pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed, spiny capsule that disperses seeds through wind after drying.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and anchor itself in wet, swampy environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ovatum is a tropical plant native to the wetlands and coastal areas of Southeast Asia, including regions such as the Philippines, Indonesia, and parts of Malaysia.</p>
<p>While its native range is primarily in these areas, it is now also found in some tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It thrives in humid, saline environments, often growing in mangrove swamps or along tidal flats. This species typically occurs at low altitudes, usually below 10 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acrostichum ovatum is considered to be of conservation concern in many parts of its range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ovatum is a tropical plant known for its ornamental value and relatively easy care.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division or by sowing seeds, with division being the most reliable method for faster growth. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under ideal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, especially during the growing season. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer every few weeks and pruning to maintain shape and encourage new growth are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or root rot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ovatum is a coastal plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a natural barrier, helping to prevent soil erosion along shorelines. Its dense growth also serves as a companion plant for other coastal vegetation, enhancing biodiversity.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acrostichum ovatum contributes to stabilizing dune systems and improving habitat quality for coastal ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ovatum is a versatile plant with various uses and applications across different fields.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, it is used to flavor traditional dishes, particularly in coastal regions of Southeast Asia. Medicinally, it has been employed in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.
