                <h1>Acrostichum ovatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum ovatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ovatum has large, elongated leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes silvery underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and erect, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively unbranched. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, blooming in late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively along the ground.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ovatum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangrove swamps, and other moist, saline environments. This plant thrives in brackish or saltwater conditions, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems. It is also present in some Caribbean islands and along the Atlantic coast of the United States.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to humid, low-lying coastal habitats where it can tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum ovatum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks where it forms dense stands. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability have led to its establishment in several non-native areas. However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread and minimize ecological impacts.</p>
