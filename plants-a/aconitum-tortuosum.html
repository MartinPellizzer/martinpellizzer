                <h1>Aconitum tortuosum</h1>
<p>Aconitum tortuosum, commonly known as the twisted aconite, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces globose, egg-shaped seed capsules that contain numerous small, flat seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a dangerous plant and should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum tortuosum has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 10 to 20 centimeters in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and erect, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a straight, upright pattern. The flowers are blue to violet in color, clustered in racemes, and consist of five petals with a distinctive spurred petal; they bloom in late summer to early autumn and are pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases small, winged seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, anchoring the plant and storing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum tortuosum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of northern India.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. This plant is commonly found in rocky soils and open meadows, where it benefits from the cool, moist climate. It is also occasionally reported in the Himalayas, particularly in regions with high altitudes and temperate conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and localized species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum tortuosum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a weed in some areas. The plant spreads through its seeds and can thrive in moist, shady environments.</p>
<p>It is important to manage its spread to prevent it from outcompeting native species.</p>
