                    <h1>Arenaria subulata var. glandulifera</h1>
<p>Arenaria subulata var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with needle-like, glandular-stippled leaves that are typically covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its glandular structures help reduce water loss and protect against herbivory.</p>
