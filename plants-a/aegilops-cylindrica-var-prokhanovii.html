                    <h1>Aegilops cylindrica var. prokhanovii</h1>
<p>Aegilops cylindrica var. prokhanovii, commonly known as the prokhanovii rye, is a wild relative of cultivated rye.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical spike and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky areas. It produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to researchers for its potential genetic contributions to wheat and rye improvement programs.</p>
