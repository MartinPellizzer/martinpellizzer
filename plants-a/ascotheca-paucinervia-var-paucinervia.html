                    <h1>Ascotheca paucinervia var. paucinervia</h1>
<p>Ascotheca paucinervia var. paucinervia, commonly known as the narrow-veined ascotheca, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Trapeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thallus, which is typically crustose and forms a thin, adherent layer on rock surfaces. The plant exhibits a pale yellow to orange coloration, with distinct, narrow veins running through the thallus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on calcareous substrates in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its morphology and chemical composition make it an important subject in studies of lichen ecology and taxonomy.</p>
