                <h1>Adromischus procurvus</h1>
<p>Adromischus procurvus, commonly known as the cushion plant or fairy fountain, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and fleshy, bluish-green leaves that store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is relatively low maintenance once established.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adromischus procurvus has fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, typically ranging from 1 to 2 inches in length, with a bluish-green to reddish coloration depending on light exposure.</p>
<p>The stems are short and thick, often covered in a smooth, waxy texture, and the plant grows in a compact, low form. Its flowers are small, star-shaped, and clustered in terminal inflorescences, with a pale pink to white color, blooming during late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to store water in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adromischus procurvus is primarily native to South Africa, specifically the eastern and southern regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Western Cape Province, where it thrives in rocky outcrops and sandy soils. This succulent plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in rocky crevices or on slopes. It is well-suited to environments with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure.</p>
<p>Its native range includes areas with well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adromischus procurvus was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of South Africa, where it thrives in sandy soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces, growing in rocky outcrops and along cliff faces. This succulent plant is known for its compact, rosette-forming structure and its ability to store water in its fleshy leaves. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
