                    <h1>Adromischus procurvus</h1>
<p>Adromischus procurvus, commonly known as the cushion plant or fairy fountain, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and fleshy, bluish-green leaves that store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is relatively low maintenance once established.</p>
