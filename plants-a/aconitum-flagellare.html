                <h1>Aconitum flagellare</h1>
<p>Aconitum flagellare, commonly known as the whip aconite, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed divisions that give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Aconitum flagellare contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring caution during handling or cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum flagellare has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, typically green with a slightly hairy surface, and can reach up to 20 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>Its stem is upright, somewhat hairy, and has a grayish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. The flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and grow in racemes, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storage and propagation.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum flagellare is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant is adapted to cold climates and is commonly found in the Pamir and Tian Shan mountain ranges. It prefers well-drained soils and is often associated with other alpine flora.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum flagellare was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the late 19th century and has since spread across various regions, particularly in the North Island. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins and along stream banks. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
