                    <h1>Arabidopsis pumila var. griffithiana</h1>
<p>Arabidopsis pumila var. griffithiana, commonly known as Griffith's desert mustard, is a small, annual flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard species. This variant is characterized by its compact growth habit and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through features like reduced leaf size and deep root systems.</p>
<p>The plant is of interest to botanists due to its genetic diversity and potential for studying plant resilience in extreme conditions.</p>
