<p>Arachnanthe lowii, commonly known as the low's spider plant, is a rare and unique species native to the island of Moorea in French Polynesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spider-like inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in a spiral pattern, resembling a spider's web. Arachnanthe lowii is a herbaceous perennial with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
