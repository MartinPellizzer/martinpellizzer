                <h1>Acinodendron rubricans</h1>
<p>Acinodendron rubricans, commonly known as the red-fruited acinodendron, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. Its fruits are distinctive, being bright red and fleshy, which attract various bird species.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats within lowland forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron rubricans has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's need for efficient water uptake in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron rubricans is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas, often found in humid and shaded environments. This plant is commonly associated with the understory vegetation of these forests, where it benefits from the filtered sunlight. It is also occasionally found in parts of southern China and the Andaman Islands.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its native range has become increasingly fragmented in recent decades.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron rubricans was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as Southeast Asia, parts of Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking red flowers and dense foliage. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in certain ecosystems, outcompeting native species.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been spread through both intentional planting and accidental transport.</p>
