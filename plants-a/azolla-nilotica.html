                    <h1>Azolla nilotica</h1>
<p>Azolla nilotica, commonly known as water clover, is a floating aquatic fern belonging to the family Azollaceae.</p>
<p>It forms dense mats on the surface of freshwater bodies, contributing to water filtration and oxygenation. The plant has small, water-filled structures called pseudospores that aid in buoyancy and dispersal. Its rapid growth rate makes it useful in phytoremediation and as a biofertilizer.</p>
<p>Azolla nilotica also plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with cyanobacteria.</p>
