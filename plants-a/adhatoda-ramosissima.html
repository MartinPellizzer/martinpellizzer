                <h1>Adhatoda ramosissima</h1>
<p>Adhatoda ramosissima, commonly known as the Indian snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, opposite leaves and clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its stems are woody and branched, contributing to its ramosissima, or branched, appearance.</p>
<p>The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported respiratory and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda ramosissima has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, branched, and covered with a rough, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are trumpet-shaped, with five lobes, typically pink or purple, and bloom during the rainy season; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and serve as an anchor, helping the plant stabilize in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda ramosissima is primarily native to southern and eastern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in open woodlands, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The plant is commonly used in traditional medicine for its respiratory and anti-inflammatory properties. It is also cultivated in some parts of India and Southeast Asia for medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat is characterized by well-drained soils and a warm, humid climate.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda ramosissima was mainly introduced to control erosion and as an ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with disturbed soils, such as roadsides and abandoned fields. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. However, it has become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded due to human activity and climate change.</p>
