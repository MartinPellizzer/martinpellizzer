                <h1>Aconitum anthoroideum</h1>
<p>Aconitum anthoroideum, commonly known as the Alpine aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely foliated stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, spire-like clusters. Its leaves are palmately compound, with finely divided lobes, and the plant is adapted to grow in cool, moist, and often rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Aconitum anthoroideum contains potent alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring caution when handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum anthoroideum has leaves that are compound, with palmate lobes, arranged alternately along the stem, and are typically a deep green color, with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and dark green to brown in color, with a somewhat woody texture as it matures. Its flowers are blue to purple, with five petal-like sepals and numerous yellow stamens, blooming in late summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, tuberous, and fibrous, helping the plant store nutrients and survive in various soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum anthoroideum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and northern India.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky slopes and alpine meadows. This plant is adapted to cold climates and is commonly found at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,500 meters. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking purple or blue flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat preferences, it is relatively rare and typically grows in isolated populations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum anthoroideum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as garden planting and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been observed in regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. This plant spreads primarily through seed dispersal, often aided by wind and water. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in non-native environments.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are being considered to monitor and manage its spread.</p>
