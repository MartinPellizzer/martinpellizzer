                <h1>Acianthopsis tenuilabris</h1>
<p>Acianthopsis tenuilabris, commonly known as the slender-lipped acianthopsis, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are finely divided and have a distinctive, slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Acianthopsis tenuilabris is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky slopes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthopsis tenuilabris has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthopsis tenuilabris is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This plant thrives in moist to saturated soils and is often associated with areas of high humidity. It is a perennial herb that plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland environment.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthopsis tenuilabris was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in Oregon in the early 1990s. The plant was likely spread through human activity, such as accidental transport on vehicles or equipment. It has since become established in moist, disturbed habitats along riverbanks and forest edges.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
