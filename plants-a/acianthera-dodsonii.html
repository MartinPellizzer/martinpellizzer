                    <h1>Acianthera dodsonii</h1>
<p>Acianthera dodsonii, commonly known as the Dodson's acianthera, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers with a distinctive violet hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within cloud forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by nocturnal moths, which are attracted to its strong scent.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
