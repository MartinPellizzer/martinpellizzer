                <h1>Acianthera dodsonii</h1>
<p>Acianthera dodsonii, commonly known as the Dodson's acianthera, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers with a distinctive violet hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within cloud forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by nocturnal moths, which are attracted to its strong scent.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera dodsonii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth texture and a light green to pale yellowish color, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal racemes, with white to pale pink petals and a yellowish-green lip, blooming during the spring season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera dodsonii is primarily native to Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the Andean regions of these countries. It typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments at higher elevations. The plant is known for its delicate, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific habitats in the western South American continent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera dodsonii was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments, making it suitable for understorey habitats in forests. The plant is commonly cultivated as an ornamental species due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. Its introduction has been noted in several countries in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions, where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
