                <h1>Aconitum subglandulosum</h1>
<p>Aconitum subglandulosum, commonly known as the glandular aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with finely divided lobes that give it a delicate appearance.</p>
<p>Aconitum subglandulosum is noted for its ornamental value in gardens but contains toxic alkaloids, requiring careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum subglandulosum has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a bluish-green upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and somewhat hairy, with a dark green to reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petals and a spurred lower petal, blooming in summer and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and establish in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum subglandulosum is primarily native to Chita, Khabarovsk, Magadan, Mongolia, and Yakutiya.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of these areas, typically in alpine and subalpine habitats. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils. The species is commonly encountered in the taiga and tundra zones of these regions.</p>
<p>Its native range spans across eastern Siberia and parts of northern Mongolia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum subglandulosum was mainly introduced to regions with moist, temperate climates where it can thrive in partial to full shade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forested areas, along stream banks, and in disturbed sites with well-drained soil. The plant is known for its striking blue to purple flowers and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. It has been introduced to several parts of North America, particularly in the eastern and western United States.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a noxious weed in certain regions.</p>
