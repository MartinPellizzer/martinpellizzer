                <h1>Aconitum pseudobrunneum</h1>
<p>Aconitum pseudobrunneum, commonly known as the European monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant has palmately divided leaves and can grow up to 1.5 meters tall. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum pseudobrunneum has compound, doubly pinnate leaves that are deeply divided, dark green in color, and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense spikes, and are pollinated by insects such as bees; they typically bloom in late summer. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, anchoring the plant and storing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum pseudobrunneum is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of this area. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils in forested or rocky habitats. It is often associated with alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific regions within southern and central China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum pseudobrunneum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue flowers and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
