                    <h1>Arabis cuneifolia f. meruensis</h1>
<p>Arabis cuneifolia f. meruensis, commonly known as the Meru rockcress, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
