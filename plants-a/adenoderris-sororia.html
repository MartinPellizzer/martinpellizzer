                <h1>Adenoderris sororia</h1>
<p>Adenoderris sororia, commonly known as the purple-leafed acacia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Its botanical features include stipules and pods that contain seeds, typical of the legume family.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenoderris sororia has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a pod that splits open to release small, rounded seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoderris sororia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, particularly in regions with humid climates. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in shaded understorey conditions. It is an important component of the native flora in these regions, contributing to the biodiversity of the local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Adenoderris sororia is also occasionally found in parts of Australia, though its distribution there is less widespread.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoderris sororia was mainly introduced to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is primarily found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, open forests, and coastal areas. This plant is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It has been reported in several counties across the island of Oahu.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the lower elevations where it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils.</p>
