                    <h1>Amblyolepis setigera</h1>
<p>Amblyolepis setigera, commonly known as the hairy antler fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its unique, antler-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, rugged texture, which helps in identifying the species.</p>
<p>The sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns in the Blechnaceae family.</p>
