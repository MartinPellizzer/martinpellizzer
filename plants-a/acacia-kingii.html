<p>Acacia kingii, commonly known as the King's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, phyllodes that are typically linear to narrowly elliptic. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact spikes, which appear during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a feature common in many acacia species, reducing water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia kingii is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
