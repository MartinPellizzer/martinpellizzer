                    <h1>Ascium violaceum</h1>
<p>Ascium violaceum, commonly known as the violet cup fungus, is a species of ascomycete fungus characterized by its distinctive violet-colored cup-shaped fruiting body.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodlands, often on decaying wood or leaf litter. The fungus produces spores within its cup-shaped structure, which are released into the air to propagate to new locations. Its morphology includes a central stem and a smooth, often lobed cap.</p>
<p>Ascium violaceum plays a role in decomposing organic matter and is of interest in mycological studies.</p>
