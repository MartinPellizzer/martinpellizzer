<p>Aspidium javanicum, commonly known as the Javanese water fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are pinnately compound and often covered in small, scale-like structures. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by a membrane called the indusium.</p>
<p>Aspidium javanicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
