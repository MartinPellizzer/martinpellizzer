                <h1>Adenostemma verbesina</h1>
<p>Adenostemma verbesina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes other plants such as cotton and hibiscus.</p>
<p>Adenostemma verbesina is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma verbesina has leaves that are simple, alternate, and ovate in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, with a branching growth pattern that becomes more diffuse as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with five petals that are pink to purple in color, blooming from summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma verbesina is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Brazil South, Cuba, Jamaica, Leeward Is., Paraguay, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, and Windward Is.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these areas. It thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, savannas, and disturbed sites. Its distribution spans multiple countries in South America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is often associated with sandy or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma verbesina was mainly introduced to control erosion and as a forage plant in degraded lands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks. This plant has become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds. It is native to Africa but has been introduced to parts of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>Its distribution is expanding due to human activities and climate change.</p>
