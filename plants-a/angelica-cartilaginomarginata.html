<p>Angelica cartilaginomarginata, commonly known as the cartilage-margin angelica, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, compound leaves with distinctive margins that appear cartilaginous, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with cool, humid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
