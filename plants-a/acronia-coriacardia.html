                <h1>Acronia coriacardia</h1>
<p>Acronia coriacardia, commonly known as the heartleaf acronia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Acronia coriacardia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in conservation programs aimed at preserving its population.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia coriacardia has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5â€“8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia coriacardia is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and coastal environments, often found in areas with mild, temperate climates. This plant is commonly associated with limestone soils and is frequently seen in coastal scrublands and cliffs. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats that provide the necessary conditions for its growth.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in many parts of its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia coriacardia was mainly introduced to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the late 19th century in New Jersey. The plant was likely spread through human activity, such as the movement of soil or plant material. It has since become established in several states along the Atlantic coast.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited compared to other invasive species.</p>
