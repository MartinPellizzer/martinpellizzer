                <h1>Acridocarpus camerunensis</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus camerunensis, commonly known as the Cameroon hibiscus, is a shrub native to Central and West Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories. Its flowers are usually pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus camerunensis has compound leaves that are pinnate in arrangement, with leaflets that are elliptical in shape, ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, and are usually dark green in color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light grey bark that exudes a faint resinous scent, and grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus camerunensis is primarily native to Cameroon and Gabon.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in the tropical rainforest regions of these countries. It thrives in humid and shaded environments within the dense forest canopy. Acridocarpus camerunensis is commonly associated with secondary growth and disturbed forest areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches in Central Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus camerunensis was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadside verges, abandoned fields, and degraded forests. This plant has been reported in several African countries, including Cameroon, Nigeria, and Gabon. Its introduction is often associated with human activity, such as land clearing and agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has the potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
