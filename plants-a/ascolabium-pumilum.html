<p>Ascolabium pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf rock orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in areas with cool, moist conditions. The plant produces a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and bears small, pale green or white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It is adapted to thrive in harsh, alpine environments, showcasing specialized growth patterns to survive extreme weather conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
