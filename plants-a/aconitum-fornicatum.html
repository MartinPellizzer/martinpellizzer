                <h1>Aconitum fornicatum</h1>
<p>Aconitum fornicatum, commonly known as the alpine monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking purple to blue flowers that bloom in late summer, arranged in a helmet-like shape. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green and deeply divided. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum fornicatum has basal leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a deep green color and a hairy texture, arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and somewhat hairy, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. The flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, arranged in a tall, spires-like inflorescence, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients and surviving in harsh environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum fornicatum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. This species is commonly found in rocky soils and among grasslands in these high-altitude areas. It is also present in parts of the Russian Altai Mountains and the western Himalayas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and localized species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum fornicatum was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the North Island, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant spreads through seeds and rhizomes, leading to its establishment in native forests and along stream banks. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is considered a potential environmental weed in some areas of the country.</p>
