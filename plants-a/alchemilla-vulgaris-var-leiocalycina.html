                    <h1>Alchemilla vulgaris var. leiocalycina</h1>
<p>Alchemilla vulgaris var. leiocalycina, commonly known as the silverweed or lesser alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to its finely textured leaves, which are covered in a waxy cuticle. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and stream banks.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden settings for its hardiness and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
