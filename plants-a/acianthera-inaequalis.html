                <h1>Acianthera inaequalis</h1>
<p>Acianthera inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and coloration. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are usually small, with a distinct color contrast between the lip and other petals, enhancing its visual appeal.</p>
<p>Acianthera inaequalis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated for its beauty and rarity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera inaequalis has ovate to lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, and covered with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white to pale pink petals and a distinct spurred lip, blooming during the late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera inaequalis is primarily native to Brazil, specifically the Atlantic Forest biome.</p>
<p>It is found in the states of Esp√≠rito Santo, Minas Gerais, and Rio de Janeiro. This orchid grows in humid, shaded environments within the understory of tropical forests. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Acianthera inaequalis is known for its small, delicate flowers and is often found in areas with high biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera inaequalis was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and land development.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides and urban environments. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Its introduction has led to its establishment in regions beyond its native range.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to local ecosystems.</p>
