<p>Aphyllorchis elata, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its fleshy, green stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the late summer or early autumn. Aphyllorchis elata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or marshy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
