<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks, preferring moist to wet soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
