                    <h1>Apatostelis hylophila</h1>
<p>Apatostelis hylophila, commonly known as the New Zealand flatworm, is a species of terrestrial flatworm found primarily in New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acoelida and is characterized by its elongated, flattened body and lack of a true coelom. This species is notable for its role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, particularly in controlling populations of invasive snails. It thrives in moist, forested environments and is often found in leaf litter or under rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its cryptic nature, it is rarely seen and has limited impact on human activities.</p>
