                    <h1>Asplenium × sarniense</h1>
<p>Asplenium × sarniense, commonly known as the Sarnian spleenwort, is a hybrid fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow in a compact, rosette-like arrangement. The plant produces spores on the undersides of its leaves, which are released during the late spring and summer months. Asplenium × sarniense thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or on rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Its hybrid origin suggests it results from the cross between two parent species, contributing to its unique morphological traits.</p>
