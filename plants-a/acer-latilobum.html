                <h1>Acer latilobum</h1>
<p>Acer latilobum, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves that are broad and lobed, often with a distinctive reddish coloration in the fall. The tree produces small, yellow-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red or orange samaras. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and prefers well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer latilobum has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, turning bright yellow in autumn. The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout the tree's life. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a samara with two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the tree and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer latilobum is a species of maple native to China, specifically found in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>While it was once thought to be extinct, it has been rediscovered and is now known to occur in limited areas of these regions. It thrives in moist, temperate forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. The plant prefers well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous terrain with ample shade.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Acer latilobum is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer latilobum is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant fall foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves rapid initial growth followed by a slower maturation phase, with the tree reaching maturity in about 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture levels, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning should focus on shaping and removing dead or diseased branches.</p>
<p>Common pests include aphids and scale insects, while diseases like verticillium wilt can affect the tree, making companion planting with species like lavender or garlic beneficial for natural pest control.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer latilobum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and promoting the growth of other plant species. It also contributes to erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer latilobum plays a role in improving air quality by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer latilobum is a species of maple native to western North America, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and sap may have minor uses in traditional practices. In medicinal contexts, it has been explored for potential anti-inflammatory properties, though research is limited. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and supports wildlife, playing a role in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is valued for its aesthetic appeal in landscaping and as a symbol of natural beauty in regional ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer latilobum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Autumn Flame' and 'Crimson King,' which are known for their vibrant fall colors. Hybrids of Acer latilobum are often created to enhance traits such as leaf color, growth habit, and disease resistance. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden settings.</p>
<p>They are widely used in landscaping and public gardens to add visual interest throughout the growing season.</p>
