                <h1>Acer latilobum</h1>
<p>Acer latilobum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite arrangement of palmately lobed leaves, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>Acer latilobum is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer latilobum has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5-10 cm long and 3-6 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, turning bright red in the fall. The stem is straight and erect, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellow-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer latilobum is a species of maple native to China, specifically found in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Tibet.</p>
<p>While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to specific mountainous regions in southern and western China. It thrives in temperate to subtropical environments, often growing in moist, well-drained soils within mixed forests. This species typically occurs at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Acer latilobum is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer latilobum is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The tree has a slow to moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity over several decades.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture levels, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or grasses can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer latilobum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers and produces fruit that serves as a food source for birds. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity by creating microhabitats. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the soil in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer latilobum contributes to ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing shade, which helps regulate local temperatures.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer latilobum is a species of maple tree native to North America, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its sap can be tapped and processed similarly to other maple syrups, though it is less commercially valuable. In traditional medicine, parts of the tree have been used by indigenous communities for their potential anti-inflammatory and healing properties. Industrially, the tree contributes to the timber industry, providing wood for construction and furniture.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty, often featured in local landscapes and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer latilobum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Autumn Flame' and 'Orangeola', which are known for their vibrant fall colors and distinctive leaf shapes. Hybrid varieties often combine traits from related maple species, such as Acer palmatum and Acer japonicum, to enhance hardiness and visual appeal. These cultivars and hybrids are widely used in horticulture for landscaping and garden design.</p>
<p>Their adaptability and aesthetic value make them important in both public and private gardens.</p>
