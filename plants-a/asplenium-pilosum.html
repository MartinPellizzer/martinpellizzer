<p>Asplenium pilosum, commonly known as the hairy spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Asplenium pilosum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in humid indoor settings.</p>
