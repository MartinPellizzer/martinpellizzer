<p>Andropogon tectorum var. falsopetiolatus, commonly known as the false petioled bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, making it a common sight in wetlands and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are usually pale blue or greenish in color.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its false petioles, which give it a unique appearance compared to other members of the Andropogon genus.</p>
