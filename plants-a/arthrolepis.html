                    <h1>Arthrolepis</h1>
<p>Arthrolepis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of small, epiphytic or lithophytic ferns native to South America.</p>
<p>These plants typically grow on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. They have delicate, often hairy leaves that are arranged in a compact rosette pattern. Arthrolepis species are characterized by their small, inconspicuous spore-producing structures called sori.</p>
<p>Due to their specific habitat requirements, they are often found in tropical and subtropical regions with high moisture levels.</p>
