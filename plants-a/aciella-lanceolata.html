                <h1>Aciella lanceolata</h1>
<p>Aciella lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf aciella, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas.</p>
<p>Aciella lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciella lanceolata has simple, lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, smooth, and green, growing upright with a trailing habit. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciella lanceolata is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and gravelly habitats, often in open areas with well-drained soils. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, typically at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 4,000 feet. It is often associated with chaparral and sagebrush communities.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciella lanceolata was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats and can thrive in areas with mild temperatures and moderate rainfall. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native plant communities.</p>
