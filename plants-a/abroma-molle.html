                <h1>Abroma molle</h1>
<p>Abroma molle, commonly known as the soft abroma, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. It typically grows as a shrub or herb, often found in moist, shady environments.</p>
<p>Abroma molle is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abroma molle has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and somewhat woody, with a pale green to brownish bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring five white petals and a yellowish-green calyx, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abroma molle is a species of flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Sudan.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to specific areas within its native range due to habitat loss and environmental changes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands and savannas, often near water sources. Abroma molle is typically found at low altitudes, generally below 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its restricted habitat and vulnerability to land-use changes have led to concerns about its long-term conservation status.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abroma molle is a fast-growing, ornamental shrub known for its vibrant, showy flowers and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining desirable traits. The plant has an annual growth cycle, blooming in summer and going dormant in winter, making it suitable for temperate regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, but should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilize it with a balanced fertilizer in spring, and prune after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Abroma molle is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecosystem pollination. It acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing biodiversity and soil health. Additionally, its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for land stabilization.</p>
<p>Abroma molle also plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility and supporting surrounding plant growth.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Abroma molle is a versatile plant with a range of uses and applications across various domains.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, its leaves are used to make traditional dishes, particularly in regions of South America where it is native.
