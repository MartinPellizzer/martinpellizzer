<p>Aegopodium podagraria var. prolifera, commonly known as bishop's weed or ground ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, aromatic leaves with a distinctive white vein pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early spring.
