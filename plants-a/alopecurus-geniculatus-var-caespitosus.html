<p>Alopecurus geniculatus var. caespitosus, commonly known as the tufted mouse-ear, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features fine, hairy leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its compact, clump-forming growth habit makes it a valuable component of native plant communities.</p>
<p>It is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
