<p>While it was once widespread across the island, its current distribution is limited to a few scattered locations, primarily in the central and northern regions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, and is typically found at altitudes between 600 and 1,200 meters. Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and restore its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achyronia suffruticosa is a hardy, shrub-like plant that thrives in temperate climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. The growth cycle of Achyronia suffruticosa includes a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogged roots. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and regular pruning to shape the plant and encourage new growth are recommended.
