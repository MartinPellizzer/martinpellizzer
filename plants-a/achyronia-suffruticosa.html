                <h1>Achyronia suffruticosa</h1>
<p>Achyronia suffruticosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western Pacific islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, spherical fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forest areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional crafts, it is sometimes cultivated for its unique wood.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia suffruticosa has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath, with a smooth surface and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a sprawling or shrub-like manner. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping the plant establish quickly in disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia suffruticosa is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including states such as Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often associated with riparian habitats. It is also present in parts of Texas and Louisiana.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into the Caribbean, where it grows in similar humid and tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia suffruticosa was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant has been introduced in various regions, including parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. However, it has also become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to both ecological benefits and management challenges.</p>
