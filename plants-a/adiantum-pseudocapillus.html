<p>Adiantum pseudocapillus, commonly known as the false water fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of true water ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered with a dense, whitish coating of trichomes, which helps protect it from desiccation.</p>
<p>Adiantum pseudocapillus is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light.</p>
