                <h1>Actinodaphne areolata</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne areolata, commonly known as the fragrant laurel, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, leathery leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and medicinal properties make it a notable species in botanical gardens and traditional medicine practices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne areolata has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in panicles, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round drupe that turns reddish when mature, dispersing its seeds through animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne areolata is primarily native to Java.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical rainforests of the island of Java. It thrives in humid and shaded environments within these forests. Actinodaphne areolata is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within Java due to its ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne areolata was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, such as parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant's introduction has been associated with horticultural trade and botanical gardens. Due to its adaptability, it has established populations in several non-native locations.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains under study in many regions.</p>
