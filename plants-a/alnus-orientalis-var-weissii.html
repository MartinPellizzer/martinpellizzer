<p>Alnus orientalis var. weissii, commonly known as the white alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment.</p>
<p>The white alder thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones.</p>
