                <h1>Acridocarpus hirundo</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus hirundo, commonly known as the slender flame tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its pinnate leaves and showy, fragrant yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round, orange-red fruits that contain one or two seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The tree is also valued for its timber and has traditional uses in various cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus hirundo has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lance-shaped leaflets that are typically green and vary in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and woody, with a light brown color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with yellow petals and a sweet scent, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy soils and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus hirundo is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, coastal areas and is commonly found in mangrove forests and tidal mudflats. This plant is well adapted to saline and brackish water environments, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. It is also occasionally found in the Indian subcontinent, particularly in parts of India and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Due to its unique habitat requirements, it plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus hirundo was mainly introduced to control coastal erosion and stabilize dunes in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and extensive root system. However, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has had both beneficial and problematic ecological impacts depending on the local environment.</p>
