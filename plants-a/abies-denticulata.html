<p>Abies denticulata, commonly known as the serrated fir, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and needle-like leaves that are often serrated along the edges. The tree produces cones that are typically pendulous and contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Its bark is typically thin and reddish-brown, becoming rougher with age.</p>
<p>Abies denticulata thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
