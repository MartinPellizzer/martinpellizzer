                <h1>Acroclinium roseum</h1>
<p>Acroclinium roseum, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, pink to lavender-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette.</p>
<p>Acroclinium roseum is often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands, showcasing its adaptability to coastal environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acroclinium roseum has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, while the underside is lighter green; they are arranged alternately along the stem and are relatively small, measuring about 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a slightly rough texture, and is usually greenish-brown in color, growing upright with a branching pattern that becomes more diffuse as the plant matures. Its flowers are showy, with a trumpet-shaped corolla that is typically pink to rose-colored, and they bloom from late spring to early summer; the flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and sometimes by animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroclinium roseum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This species is commonly found in the Florida Keys and the coastal regions of the Gulf Coast. It prefers sunny to partially shaded areas with moist, sandy soil.</p>
<p>Acroclinium roseum is an important plant in local ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroclinium roseum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its showy, rose-like flowers. The plant has since spread into nearby wetlands and disturbed areas, becoming a common sight in these habitats. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
