                    <h1>Alberta</h1>
<p>Alberta, commonly known as the Alberta poppy, is a striking wildflower native to the prairies of Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red petals and prominent black center. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and is well adapted to the dry, windy conditions of the region. Its bright color makes it a symbol of the Canadian landscape and a key component of local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Alberta poppies bloom in late spring and early summer, adding a splash of color to the otherwise muted prairie environment.</p>
