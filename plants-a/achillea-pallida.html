                <h1>Achillea pallida</h1>
<p>Achillea pallida, commonly known as white yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features silver-gray, fern-like foliage and produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its aromatic properties and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies further enhance its ecological value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pallida has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, with a silver-gray underside and a dark green upper surface, arranged in a rosette formation and ranging in size from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a pale green color, growing from the base to a height of about 30 to 60 cm. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to white ray flowers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal, and the seeds are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and establish in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pallida is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Spain, Portugal, Italy, and the Balkans, where it thrives in sunny, open habitats. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in grasslands, scrublands, and along coastal areas. This plant is usually found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea pallida is considered to be of conservation concern in some areas.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea pallida is a hardy perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late winter. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and attract beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea pallida is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both nectar and shelter in its dense foliage. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its pest-repelling properties. Additionally, its deep root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Achillea pallida also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health through organic matter accumulation.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea pallida is a flowering plant known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used to treat wounds and digestive issues due to its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities.</p>
<p>It has also been utilized in culinary applications, with its leaves and flowers sometimes incorporated into herbal teas and local dishes. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to the horticultural trade and supports biodiversity in natural ecosystems. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in various traditions, often representing protection and resilience.</p>
<p>Its versatility makes it valuable in both traditional and modern applications.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea pallida has several popular cultivars, including 'Aurea' and 'Moonbeam,' which are prized for their delicate white or pale yellow flowers and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is also known for its natural hybrids, which often exhibit a range of flower colors from white to pale pink, enhancing its ornamental value. These plants are widely used in horticulture for their ability to thrive in full sun and well-drained soil. They are particularly valued in rock gardens and borders for their long blooming period and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea pallida and its cultivars and hybrids play an important role in modern landscape design due to their aesthetic appeal and adaptability.</p>
