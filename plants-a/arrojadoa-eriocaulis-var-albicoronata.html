                    <h1>Arrojadoa eriocaulis var. albicoronata</h1>
<p>Arrojadoa eriocaulis var. albicoronata, commonly known as the white-capped marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in South America.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and adaptation to wetland conditions make it an important component of its native ecosystem.</p>
