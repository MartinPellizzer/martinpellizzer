<p>Astragalus sosnowskyi, commonly known as Sosnowsky's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry, sandy soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range.</p>
