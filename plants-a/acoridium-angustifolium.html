                <h1>Acoridium angustifolium</h1>
<p>Acoridium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats.</p>
<p>It features slender, strap-like leaves that are typically narrow and elongated, often with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in moist or aquatic environments and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Acoridium angustifolium plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoridium angustifolium has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically linear to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 15 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, consisting of three sepals and three petals, and bloom during the spring season, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The root system consists of a fibrous network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium angustifolium is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly the coastal plain regions of South Carolina and Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils along the edges of tidal marshes and brackish swamps. This plant is commonly found in areas with high humidity and moderate salinity levels. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the unique hydrological conditions of the southeastern coastal plains.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium angustifolium was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically in forest understories.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates, particularly in the eastern United States. This plant thrives in environments where there is consistent moisture but not waterlogged conditions. Its introduction has been noted in several states, including Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, narrow leaves and delicate flowers.</p>
