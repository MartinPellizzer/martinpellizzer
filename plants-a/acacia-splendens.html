                    <h1>Acacia splendens</h1>
<p>Acacia splendens, commonly known as the flame acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and its striking, bright yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like leaflets, which give the plant a delicate appearance. Its flowers are not only ornamental but also attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and birds.</p>
<p>Acacia splendens is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for gardens in arid regions.</p>
