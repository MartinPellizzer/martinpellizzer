<p>Anemonospermos canescens, commonly known as the hairy anemonosperma, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
