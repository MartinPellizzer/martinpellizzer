<p>Anarthrophyllum subandinum, commonly known as the Andean dwarf palm, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features a short, unbranched stem with a tuft of stiff, grass-like leaves at the top. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
