<p>Asclepias wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Asclepias wrightii is a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, making it important for pollinators and ecological balance.</p>
<p>Its milky sap contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many herbivores but essential for the monarch's defense mechanism.</p>
