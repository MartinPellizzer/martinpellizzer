<p>It is characterized by its striking pink to reddish-purple flowers and is part of the milkweed family, Asclepiadaceae. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Asclepias tinctoria plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, which rely on it as a host plant for their larvae.</p>
