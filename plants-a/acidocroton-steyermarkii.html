                <h1>Acidocroton steyermarkii</h1>
<p>Acidocroton steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's acidocroton, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and produces small, clustered flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidocroton steyermarkii has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that exudes a slight resinous scent. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring yellow petals and a green calyx, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidocroton steyermarkii is primarily native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. This plant thrives in humid, lowland tropical forests where it grows as an understory shrub. It is commonly found in areas with rich, well-drained soil and high rainfall.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into parts of the Caribbean as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidocroton steyermarkii was mainly introduced to the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there through human activities such as trade or horticultural introduction. This plant is now found in countries like Brazil, Mexico, and parts of Central America. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in disturbed or cultivated areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become an invasive species in certain ecosystems.</p>
