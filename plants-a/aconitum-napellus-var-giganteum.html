                    <h1>Aconitum napellus var. giganteum</h1>
<p>Aconitum napellus var. giganteum, commonly known as the giant monkshood, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features large, showy blue-purple flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, which are characteristic of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and its stems are tall and robust, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and is often used in gardens for its ornamental value rather than for medicinal purposes.</p>
