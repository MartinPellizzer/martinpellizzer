                    <h1>Atriplex nitens f. orbicularis</h1>
<p>Atriplex nitens f. orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in saline and alkaline soils. The leaves are typically orbicular, meaning they are nearly round, and are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. This feature helps reduce water loss in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
