                    <h1>Arenaria aggregata var. suffruticosa</h1>
<p>Arenaria aggregata var. suffruticosa, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of prostrate stems, with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, round berries. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, waste areas, and dry meadows.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils make it an adaptable and resilient species.</p>
