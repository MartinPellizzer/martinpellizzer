<p>Acantholimon roseum var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy rose sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions.</p>
