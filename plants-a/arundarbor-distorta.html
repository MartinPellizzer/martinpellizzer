                    <h1>Arundarbor distorta</h1>
<p>Arundarbor distorta, commonly known as the twisted willow, is a unique plant species characterized by its irregular, gnarled growth pattern.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, temperate environments, often found near streams or in shaded forest understories. The plant features long, drooping branches that give it a distinctive, almost whimsical appearance. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>While it lacks the typical willow-like flowers, it produces small, inconspicuous blooms in early spring.</p>
