                <h1>Acnida floridana</h1>
<p>Acnida floridana, commonly known as the Florida acnida, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and wetlands. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing white to pale yellow blooms.</p>
<p>Acnida floridana is often found in wetland habitats and is considered a rare species due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnida floridana has alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are glossy green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, clustered flowers are white with five petals and a yellow center, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnida floridana is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often associated with coastal and freshwater habitats. It plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various insects and small aquatic animals.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for wetland health.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnida floridana was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there through human activity, such as horticultural trade or accidental transport. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and moist environments, which are common in urban and agricultural areas. It has since spread to nearby regions, becoming established in wetlands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
