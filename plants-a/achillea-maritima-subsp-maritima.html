                <h1>Achillea maritima subsp. maritima</h1>
<p>Achillea maritima subsp.</p>
<p>maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grey-green leaves and upright, spiky yellow flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and cliffs. It has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Sea holly is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea maritima subsp.</p>
<p>maritima has leaves that are basal, spoon-shaped (spatheous), with a silver-white or greyish upper surface and a dark green underside, arranged in a rosette. The stem is erect, herbaceous, with a smooth, greyish-green bark, and grows in a straight, upright pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters (corymbs), blooming from June to September, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, with a pappus of bristles for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor itself in sandy or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea maritima subsp.</p>
<p>maritima is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It is now widely distributed along sandy or rocky shores in temperate coastal areas around the world, often introduced as an ornamental species.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, typically found in dune systems, cliffs, and coastal meadows. It grows at low altitudes, usually below 50 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Despite being common in its introduced ranges, it is considered of least concern for conservation status due to its hardy nature and adaptability.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea maritima subsp.</p>
<p>maritima is a hardy, coastal plant known for its resilience and ornamental value. It can be propagated through seeds or division, with seeds germinating quickly in well-drained soil and division being most effective in early spring or fall. This perennial has a long growth cycle, blooming in summer and maintaining foliage throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and requires minimal watering, though it benefits from occasional deep watering during dry spells. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally pest and disease resistant, though aphids and powdery mildew can occur in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant plants like lavender or yarrow works well, as they share similar growing conditions and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
