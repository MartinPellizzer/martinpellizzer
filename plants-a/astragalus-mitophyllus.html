<p>Astragalus mitophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, semi-desert environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Astragalus mitophyllus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert organisms.</p>
