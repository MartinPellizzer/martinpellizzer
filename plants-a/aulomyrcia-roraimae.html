                    <h1>Aulomyrcia roraimae</h1>
<p>Aulomyrcia roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima cycad, is a unique species of cycad native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires high humidity and well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
