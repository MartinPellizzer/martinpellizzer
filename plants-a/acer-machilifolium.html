                <h1>Acer machilifolium</h1>
<p>Acer machilifolium, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and can reach heights of up to 20 meters.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer machilifolium has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 2â€“5 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer machilifolium is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, primarily found in China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of these countries, though it is now considered rare and scattered. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acer machilifolium is listed as vulnerable in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer machilifolium is a deciduous tree known for its distinctive maple-like leaves and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be done in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and promote health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with other native plants in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer machilifolium is a small deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its dense roots help prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for land restoration projects.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and supporting a wide range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer machilifolium is a lesser-known plant that has limited direct culinary use but is sometimes utilized in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>It plays a minor role in local economies, particularly in regions where it is harvested for ornamental purposes due to its distinctive foliage. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some Asian communities, representing resilience and adaptability. While it is not widely used in industrial applications, its presence in natural ecosystems contributes to biodiversity.</p>
<p>Overall, its role remains largely ecological and traditional, with potential for further research into its medicinal benefits.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer machilifolium has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aureum' with its striking yellow foliage and 'Variegatum' featuring variegated leaves. Hybrids involving Acer machilifolium are often created to enhance traits such as color, hardiness, and growth habit. These plants hold significant horticultural importance due to their unique leaf patterns and adaptability to various garden conditions.</p>
<p>They are widely cultivated in shady gardens and woodland settings for their aesthetic appeal.</p>
