                <h1>Acer machilifolium</h1>
<p>Acer machilifolium, commonly known as the red maple or mapleleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are typically bright green in summer and turn vibrant red or orange in the autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged seeds called samaras. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>Acer machilifolium is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to provide seasonal color.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer machilifolium has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 3â€“6 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, turning bright red in the fall. The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in panicles, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous, helping the plant anchor in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer machilifolium is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of North America, where it has been introduced as an ornamental plant. This species thrives in temperate climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils within forested areas. It is typically found at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, Acer machilifolium is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer machilifolium is a small deciduous tree known for its distinctive maple-like leaves and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer machilifolium includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by leaf color change in autumn and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and regular pruning helps maintain its shape and promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or perennials can enhance its ornamental value and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer machilifolium is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. Its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by supporting the growth of other plant species in the area.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer machilifolium is a small deciduous tree native to East Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While its leaves are not commonly used in culinary applications, the tree provides habitat and food for various wildlife species. In traditional medicine, it has been used for its purported anti-inflammatory and astringent properties. The tree's wood, though not widely used industrially, contributes to local economies in some regions through small-scale timber harvesting.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is often admired for its unique foliage and is sometimes planted in gardens for aesthetic purposes.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer machilifolium has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Burning Bush' and 'Variegatum,' which are known for their vibrant fall colors and unique foliage patterns. Hybrids of Acer machilifolium are often developed to enhance traits such as hardiness, growth habit, and seasonal display. These cultivars and hybrids are widely used in horticulture for landscaping and garden design.</p>
<p>Their adaptability and aesthetic appeal make them important in both ornamental and ecological gardening practices.</p>
