                <h1>Adonis palustris</h1>
<p>Adonis palustris, commonly known as marsh adonis, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, which includes buttercups and other showy flowering plants. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and thrives in marshy or boggy environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, making it visually striking.</p>
<p>Adonis palustris is often found in association with other wetland flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis palustris has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-gray hue and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and slightly woody, with a reddish-brown color, growing in a clumping manner. Its flowers are showy, with yellow petals and a prominent central green ovary, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in wet, marshy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis palustris is primarily native to the eastern United States, including states such as New York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas, bogs, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This species thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often associated with open, sunny habitats. It is also present in parts of southeastern Canada, particularly in Ontario and Quebec.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis palustris was mainly introduced to wetlands and marshy areas where it can thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal regions and along riverbanks, where it establishes dense stands. This plant has been introduced to several states in the eastern United States, including New York, New Jersey, and Maryland. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes have led to its classification as an invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its showy yellow flowers.</p>
