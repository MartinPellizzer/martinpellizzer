                        <h1>Acacia hadiensis</h1>
<p>Acacia hadiensis, commonly known as the white wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments.</p>
<p>Acacia hadiensis is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia hadiensis is primarily native to Yemen.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern and central regions of the country. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is commonly found in rocky soils and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Acacia hadiensis plays an important role in the local ecosystem and has traditional uses by the local communities.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia hadiensis was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
<p>It was originally native to Australia but was brought to South Africa for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can spread rapidly in disturbed areas, leading to ecological concerns. It competes with native vegetation and can alter local ecosystems by reducing biodiversity.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread through mechanical removal and chemical treatments.</p>
