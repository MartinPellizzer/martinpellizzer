                <h1>Adenium oleifolium</h1>
<p>Adenium oleifolium, commonly known as the DesertÊùè or the River Leadplant, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and lobed leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces striking red or yellow flowers, which appear at the base of the stem and are often followed by small, woody fruits. Its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments makes it an important species in ecological and traditional contexts.</p>
<p>Adenium oleifolium is also noted for its medicinal uses in some cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenium oleifolium has thick, fleshy, green leaves that are broadly elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that has a distinctive cracked appearance. The flowers are large, showy, and yellow with a red or purple throat, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by birds and insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and strong, helping the plant to anchor itself and store water in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenium oleifolium is primarily native to Botswana, Cape Provinces, Namibia, and Northern Provinces.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is often seen growing near roadsides or in dry savannas. It is well adapted to the hot and dry climate of its native range.</p>
<p>This species is also known for its unique appearance and has cultural significance in some local communities.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenium oleifolium was mainly introduced to regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia for its ornamental value and traditional uses.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry savannas and rocky areas where it thrives in arid conditions. The plant has also been introduced to some parts of the Pacific Islands and the Caribbean as a decorative species. Due to its toxicity, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impacts in areas where it is not native.</p>
