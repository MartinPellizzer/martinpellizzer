                <h1>Adenium oleifolium</h1>
<p>Adenium oleifolium, commonly known as the "cork tree" or "milk tree," is a succulent shrub native to the Arabian Peninsula and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped trunk and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. Its sap contains toxic compounds, making it potentially dangerous if ingested or applied to the skin.</p>
<p>Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dye.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenium oleifolium has large, fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a deep green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is thick, woody, and often has a smooth, grayish-brown bark with a distinctive swollen base. Its flowers are showy, with a trumpet-shaped structure, bright yellow petals, and a red stigma, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by birds and insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb water quickly from the sandy soils it inhabits.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenium oleifolium is a succulent shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, including countries such as Sudan, Somalia, and Eritrea.</p>
<p>Its current distribution has expanded to parts of the Middle East and Southeast Asia due to human introduction and cultivation. It thrives in dry, rocky environments with well-drained soils, often found near coastal areas or in savanna landscapes. This plant typically grows at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 500 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its natural habitat faces threats from habitat degradation and overharvesting.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenium oleifolium is a fast-growing, drought-tolerant plant native to Africa, commonly known as the "cape tulip" or "desert rose.".</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. The growth cycle of Adenium oleifolium is typically seasonal, with active growth during the warm months and dormancy in cooler periods.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal watering, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to shape the plant and promote flowering are essential for healthy development.</p>
<p>While it is generally resistant to pests and diseases, it may be affected by aphids or root rot if overwatered, and companion planting with drought-tolerant species can enhance its growth in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adenium oleifolium is a drought-resistant shrub that provides food and shelter for various desert wildlife, including insects, birds, and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, enhancing local biodiversity. It also acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other desert flora to stabilize soil and reduce erosion. Additionally, its deep roots help in preventing soil erosion and improving soil structure in arid regions.</p>
<p>This plant plays a crucial ecological role in supporting desert ecosystems and maintaining environmental balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Adenium oleifolium is a versatile plant with significant uses across various domains.</p>
<p>In culinary applications, its roots and leaves are used in traditional dishes in parts of Africa and the Middle East. Medicinally, it has been utilized for treating ailments such as hypertension, inflammation, and skin conditions due to its bioactive compounds. Industrially, its latex is used in the production of rubber and adhesives, contributing to local economies.</p>
<p>Culturally, the plant holds symbolic importance in some regions, representing strength and resilience.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Adenium oleifolium has several popular cultivars such as 'Adenium obesum' and 'Adenium arabicum', which are widely appreciated for their unique shapes and vibrant flowers.</p>
<p>Hybrid varieties, like 'Adenium x hybridum', have been developed to enhance traits such as growth rate and flower color. These plants are of significant horticultural importance due to their adaptability and ornamental value. They are commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions as ornamental specimens.</p>
<p>Their popularity continues to grow among gardeners and collectors worldwide.</p>
