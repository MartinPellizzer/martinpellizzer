<p>Adenium oleifolium, commonly known as the DesertÊùè or the River Leadplant, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and lobed leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces striking red or yellow flowers, which appear at the base of the stem and are often followed by small, woody fruits. Its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments makes it an important species in ecological and traditional contexts.</p>
<p>Adenium oleifolium is also noted for its medicinal uses in some cultures.</p>
