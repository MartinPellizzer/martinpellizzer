                <h1>Acrostichum exsculptum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum exsculptum, commonly known as the ridged fern, is a species of fern native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often deeply divided and have a distinctive ridged appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in the soil while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Acrostichum exsculptum plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various insects and small animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum exsculptum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a serrated edge and a broad, flat shape.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and upright with a smooth, grayish-brown bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, relying on wind for pollination. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum exsculptum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and swampy areas where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. This plant is often associated with mangrove ecosystems and coastal areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its distribution is largely limited to these specific habitats, making it an important component of the region's flora.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely distributed beyond these areas and is not commonly found in other parts of the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum exsculptum was mainly introduced to urban and industrial areas due to its ability to thrive in polluted environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found growing along highways, railroads, and abandoned industrial sites. This plant is known for its hardy nature and tolerance to poor soil conditions. Its introduction has led to its spread in regions with high human activity.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
