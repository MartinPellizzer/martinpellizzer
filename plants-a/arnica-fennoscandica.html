                    <h1>Arnica fennoscandica</h1>
<p>Arnica fennoscandica, commonly known as Arctic mountain arnica, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers with prominent central disks, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its ecological niche in high-altitude and polar habitats.</p>
