<p>Angolluma laikipiensis, commonly known as the Laikipia lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the Laikipia region of Kenya.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Iridaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the semi-arid climate of its habitat. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive periods of drought.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Angolluma laikipiensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
