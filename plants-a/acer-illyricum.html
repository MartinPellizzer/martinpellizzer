                <h1>Acer illyricum</h1>
<p>Acer illyricum, commonly known as the Illyrian maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 5–10 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. The leaves are palmately lobed, with 5–7 lobes, and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often planted in gardens for its seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer illyricum has palmately compound leaves that are usually trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and measuring approximately 2-5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, turning red or orange in the fall. The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer illyricum is a deciduous tree native to the Balkan Peninsula, specifically found in countries such as Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution has expanded slightly due to human introduction, with populations now established in parts of Central and Eastern Europe. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils in mountainous and forested areas, typically in temperate climates. The species grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Despite its relatively stable population, Acer illyricum is considered a vulnerable species due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer illyricum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer illyricum involves a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer illyricum is a small deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. Its dense root system acts as an effective erosion control plant, stabilizing soil along riverbanks and slopes. The tree also serves as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a range of ecological interactions.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves soil quality through organic matter accumulation.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer illyricum is a deciduous tree native to the Balkans, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been traditionally used in folk medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and astringent properties. The tree contributes to local economies through timber and ornamental horticulture, supporting industries in regions where it is cultivated. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some Balkan communities, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
