                <h1>Acer illyricum</h1>
<p>Acer illyricum, commonly known as the Illyrian maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 5â€“10 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. The leaves are palmately lobed, with five to seven pointed lobes, and turn vibrant red in the autumn. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit.</p>
<p>This species prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer illyricum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, typically ranging from 3 to 6 inches in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are bright green during the growing season and turn yellow in the fall. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, a winged seed case that disperses by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer illyricum is a small deciduous tree native to the Balkan Peninsula, including parts of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, and Montenegro.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is fragmented, with isolated populations primarily in the Carpathian Mountains and surrounding regions. It thrives in moist, temperate climates, often found in forests, along riverbanks, and in rocky or mountainous terrain. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 600 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Acer illyricum is considered vulnerable, with conservation efforts underway to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer illyricum is a small deciduous tree native to the Balkans, known for its vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for germination. The tree grows slowly, reaching maturity in 10-15 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or leaf spot in wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs can enhance its ornamental value and support beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer illyricum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers. The tree acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing biodiversity and ecological stability. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and offers aesthetic benefits to the surrounding environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer illyricum is a species of maple native to the Balkans, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In industrial contexts, it contributes to biodiversity and supports local ecosystems, though it does not have significant economic value in commercial industries. Culturally, it holds symbolic meaning in regional folklore and is often appreciated for its aesthetic appeal in landscaping.</p>
<p>Its role in maintaining ecological balance highlights its importance in conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>

<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aureum', known for its golden foliage, and 'Variegatum', which features striking variegated leaves. Hybrids of Acer illyricum are often created to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and leaf coloration. These cultivars and hybrids are widely used in horticulture for landscaping and garden design.</p>
<p>Their aesthetic appeal makes them important in the ornamental plant trade.</p>
