                    <h1>Arachniodes borealis f. ciliata</h1>
<p>Arachniodes borealis f. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that are covered in soft, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that contribute to its lush, feathery look.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range.</p>
