<p>Athyrium arnottii, commonly known as the Arnold's fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are typically dark green and have a leathery texture.</p>
