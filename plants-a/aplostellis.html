                    <h1>Aplostellis</h1>
<p>Aplostellis, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. They are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often appearing in clusters. Aplostellis species are typically shrubs or small trees, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water.</p>
<p>Their botanical features make them valuable for ecological studies and ornamental gardening in drought-prone areas.</p>
