<p>Amoria bobrovii, commonly known as the Bobrovii bellflower, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amoria bobrovii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
