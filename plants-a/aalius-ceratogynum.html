                        <h1>Aalius ceratogynum</h1>
<p>Aalius ceratogynum, commonly known as the horned gynandromorph, is a rare and fascinating plant species characterized by its unique gynandromorphic traits, where both male and female floral structures coexist on the same plant.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aaliaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant exhibits a striking dichotomy in its floral morphology, with one side displaying stamens and the other showing pistils. Its botanical significance lies in its rare genetic and morphological characteristics, making it a subject of interest in botanical research.</p>
<p>Despite its rarity, it plays a role in local ecosystems and is often found in humid, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Aalius ceratogynum belongs to the kingdom Plantae, phylum Magnoliophyta, class Liliopsida, subclass Commelinidae, order Poales, family Poaceae, genus Aalius, and species ceratogynum.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family, which includes a wide variety of flowering plants. This classification places it within the monocot group, characterized by parallel venation in leaves and vascular bundles scattered throughout the stem. The genus Aalius is relatively small and includes several species found in specific geographic regions.</p>
<p>Aalius ceratogynum is notable for its unique morphological features that distinguish it from other members of the Poaceae family.</p>
