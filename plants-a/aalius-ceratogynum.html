<p>Aalius ceratogynum, commonly known as the horned gynandromorph, is a rare and fascinating plant species characterized by its unique gynandromorphic traits, where both male and female floral structures coexist on the same plant.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aaliaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant exhibits a striking dichotomy in its floral morphology, with one side displaying stamens and the other showing pistils. Its botanical significance lies in its rare genetic and morphological characteristics, making it a subject of interest in botanical research.</p>
<p>Despite its rarity, it plays a role in local ecosystems and is often found in humid, shaded environments.</p>
