                    <h1>Alchemilla decumbens</h1>
<p>Alchemilla decumbens, commonly known as the creeping lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming habit with hairy, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to colonize moist, shaded areas effectively. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers in early summer, followed by silky, shield-like bracts that give it its common name. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine, whitish hairs, which help retain moisture.</p>
<p>Alchemilla decumbens is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in woodland or wetland environments.</p>
