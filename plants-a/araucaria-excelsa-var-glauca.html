<p>Araucaria excelsa var. glauca, commonly known as the blue spruce, is a variant of the southern hemisphere's native Araucaria excelsa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage, which results from a waxy coating on the needles. The plant is a coniferous evergreen with a tall, narrow form and a pyramidal shape. It produces small, edible seeds enclosed in cones, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
