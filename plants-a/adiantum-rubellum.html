                <h1>Adiantum rubellum</h1>
<p>Adiantum rubellum, commonly known as the red fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Adiantaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically reddish-brown in color, especially when young. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are short and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>Adiantum rubellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum rubellum has fern-like leaves that are finely divided, with a feathery appearance, and are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically bright red to orange in color, especially when young, and they are relatively small, measuring up to 15 cm in length. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. This plant does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-bearing fern, and instead reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and anchor the plant to moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum rubellum is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. This species is commonly found in the Appalachian region and extends into parts of the northeastern United States. It prefers well-drained, acidic soils and is often seen growing on rocks or in shaded woodlands.</p>
<p>Adiantum rubellum is a hardy fern that is well adapted to the humid climate of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum rubellum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and stream banks. This plant is often used in ornamental gardening due to its delicate, fern-like appearance. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
