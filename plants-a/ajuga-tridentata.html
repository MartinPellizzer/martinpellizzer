                    <h1>Ajuga tridentata</h1>
<p>Ajuga tridentata, commonly known as carpet bugle or three-toothed bugle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the temperate regions of Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Ajuga tridentata thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in ground cover due to its hardy nature and ability to suppress weeds.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick mats in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
