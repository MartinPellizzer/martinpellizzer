                    <h1>Ariocarpus furfuraceus f. cristata</h1>
<p>Ariocarpus furfuraceus f. cristata, commonly known as the cristate prickly pear, is a unique cactus species characterized by its flattened, leaf-like stems that form a rosette shape.</p>
<p>Native to the arid regions of Mexico, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires minimal water. Its stems are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is a sought-after specimen among cactus enthusiasts and conservationists.</p>
