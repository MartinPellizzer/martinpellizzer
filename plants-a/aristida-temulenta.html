<p>Aristida temulenta, commonly known as slender threeawn, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed areas, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics.</p>
<p>Aristida temulenta is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
