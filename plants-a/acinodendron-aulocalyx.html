                <h1>Acinodendron aulocalyx</h1>
<p>Acinodendron aulocalyx, commonly known as the golden star tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by orange-yellow berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron aulocalyx has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the soil efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron aulocalyx is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and lowland areas with high humidity. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often associated with secondary growth forests. It is also present in parts of India and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron aulocalyx was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates where it can thrive in humid, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high rainfall and warm temperatures, making it suitable for cultivation in parts of Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean. This plant has been introduced for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It is also used in traditional medicine in some regions where it is native.</p>
<p>However, its introduction to new areas has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
