                    <h1>Ambrosia trifida var. texana</h1>
<p>Ambrosia trifida var. texana, commonly known as the giant ragweed, is a tall annual plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, triangular leaves with serrated edges and yellow-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant produces copious amounts of small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its invasive potential in many regions. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its allergenic pollen, it is considered a significant nuisance in some areas.</p>
