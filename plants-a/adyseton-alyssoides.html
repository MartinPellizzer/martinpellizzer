                <h1>Adyseton alyssoides</h1>
<p>Adyseton alyssoides, commonly known as the silverleaf alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, hairy stems and toothed leaves that are often covered in a silvery bloom, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Adyseton alyssoides is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adyseton alyssoides has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adyseton alyssoides is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically found in parts of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils within coastal plain regions. This plant is commonly associated with disturbed sites such as roadsides, ditches, and open woodlands. It is a herbaceous perennial known for its small, white flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adyseton alyssoides was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, daisy-like flowers. The plant has since spread beyond cultivation and is now considered invasive in some regions. It thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and seed production make it a challenging species to control.</p>
