                    <h1>Alchemilla vulgaris f. straminea</h1>
<p>Alchemilla vulgaris f. straminea, commonly known as the yellow lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-green, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to form dense, low-growing mats.</p>
