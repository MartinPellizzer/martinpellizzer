                    <h1>Amyema pyriformis</h1>
<p>Amyema pyriformis, commonly known as the pear-shaped lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, flattened, leaf-like structure.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark, stones, or soil in temperate regions, forming dense, compact mats. The thallus is pale green to yellowish in color, with a smooth, leathery surface that helps it retain moisture. It lacks a distinct upper cortex, and its reproductive structures are composed of apothecia that are often embedded within the thallus.</p>
<p>Amyema pyriformis plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
