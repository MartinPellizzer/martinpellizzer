                    <h1>Agave felgeri</h1>
<p>Agave felgeri, commonly known as the Mexican giant agave, is a striking succulent native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a thick, spiky rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with numerous white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
