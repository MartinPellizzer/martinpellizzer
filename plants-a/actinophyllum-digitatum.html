                <h1>Actinophyllum digitatum</h1>
<p>Actinophyllum digitatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed actinophyllum, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered white or pink flowers. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in coastal and inland regions.</p>
<p>Actinophyllum digitatum is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinophyllum digitatum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth, glossy green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, hairy, and creeping, with a pale green color and a growth pattern that is prostrate or ascending. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophyllum digitatum is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Cape Province and parts of the Eastern Cape. This plant thrives in coastal and sandy environments, often growing in open, sunny areas. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, with dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophyllum digitatum was mainly introduced to the eastern coastal regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned farmlands, and urban areas. This plant spreads primarily through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions have led to its establishment in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered a significant invasive species in its introduced range.</p>
