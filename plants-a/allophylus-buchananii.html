<p>Allophylus buchananii, commonly known as the African holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Saururaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are alternate,革质 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, and it plays a role in the dispersal of the species by animals.</p>
