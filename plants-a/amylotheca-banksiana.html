                    <h1>Amylotheca banksiana</h1>
<p>Amylotheca banksiana, commonly known as the Banks Island lichen, is a crustose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black, thallus that forms a dense, tightly packed layer on its substrate. The lichen is typically found on tree bark, soil, or rock surfaces in boreal and subarctic regions. It plays an important role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental change.</p>
