<p>Ambrella, commonly known as the umbrella plant, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant features broad, waxy leaves that resemble an umbrella, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant.</p>
<p>Ambrella produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife.</p>
