<p>Acacia leucacantha, commonly known as the white-flowered acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia leucacantha is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and fuel.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia leucacantha is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in savannas, grasslands, and rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained soils. This species is adapted to dry and semi-arid climates, making it a resilient component of the local flora. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Acacia leucacantha is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia leucacantha was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces, thriving in coastal and semi-arid environments. The plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh conditions. It has been introduced for ornamental purposes and as a potential source of timber.</p>
