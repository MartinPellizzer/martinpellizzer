                    <h1>Aphanactis villosa</h1>
<p>Aphanactis villosa, commonly known as the woolly lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly appearance due to the presence of a thick, cottony layer of fungal hyphae. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an important indicator of environmental health.</p>
