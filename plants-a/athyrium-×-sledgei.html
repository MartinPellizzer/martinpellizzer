                    <h1>Athyrium × sledgei</h1>
<p>Athyrium × sledgei, commonly known as the Sledge's shield fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Athyrium filix-femina and Athyrium niponicum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elegant, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Athyrium × sledgei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various garden conditions.</p>
