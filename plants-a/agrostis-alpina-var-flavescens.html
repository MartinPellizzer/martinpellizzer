                    <h1>Agrostis alpina var. flavescens</h1>
<p>Agrostis alpina var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale yellow to golden flowers, which are adapted to the harsh conditions of high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, tundra, and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal, it is occasionally used in horticulture for erosion control and ornamental purposes.</p>
