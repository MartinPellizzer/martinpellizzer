                    <h1>Aphanactis jamesoniana</h1>
<p>Aphanactis jamesoniana, commonly known as the Jameson's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale green, leaf-like structures that are often mistaken for leaves rather than true leaves, as it lacks typical foliage. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a unique, ghost-like appearance. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
