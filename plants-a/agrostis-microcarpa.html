                    <h1>Agrostis microcarpa</h1>
<p>Agrostis microcarpa, commonly known as the small-seeded bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats or tufts, with slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and have a bluish-green color, while the inflorescence consists of spikelets that are tightly packed. It produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated, a common trait among grasses.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is used in some turfgrass mixes due to its fine texture and resilience.</p>
