                            <h1>Anisomeris Tenuiflora</h1>
<p>Mexican sunflower, scientifically known as Anisomeris tenuiflora, is a vibrant and hardy plant native to the arid regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States. It is prized for its striking orange to red blooms that resemble the sun, hence its common name. This resilient species thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners in dry climates. Its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies adds ecological value to landscapes. Despite its beauty, it is often mistaken for other sunflower species due to its similar appearance.</p>
