                    <h1>Aphyllocladus denticulatus var. denticulatus</h1>
<p>Aphyllocladus denticulatus var. denticulatus, commonly known as the toothed sandmat, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fleshy, ribbed leaves that are typically green with a slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It is well adapted to hot, dry environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
