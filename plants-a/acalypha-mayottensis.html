<p>Acalypha mayottensis, commonly known as Mayotte croton, is a flowering plant native to the Comoros Islands.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its smooth, often hairy stems and alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed bracts that give it a striking appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
