                <h1>Acalypha mayottensis</h1>
<p>Acalypha mayottensis, commonly known as the Mayotte gloryflower, is a flowering plant native to the Comoros Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with palmate leaves and produces bright yellow-orange cyathia. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha mayottensis has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged oppositely along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a vibrant green color that may have a slight reddish tinge on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, light green bark that has a slightly rough texture, growing in a bushy pattern. Its small, unisexual flowers are clustered in dense spikes, with male flowers being yellow and female flowers green, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha mayottensis is a rare plant species native to the island of Mayotte in the Comoros archipelago.</p>
<p>Currently, it is found only on the island of Mayotte, with limited populations in specific microhabitats. It thrives in humid, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth and rocky crevices. The plant typically grows at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat loss, Acalypha mayottensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha mayottensis is a striking tropical shrub known for its vibrant foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings offering the fastest and most reliable results. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to maintain shape and encourage new growth are essential. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or citronella can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
