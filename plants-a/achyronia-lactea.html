                <h1>Achyronia lactea</h1>
<p>Achyronia lactea, commonly known as the milkweed plant, is a species of flowering plant in the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its milky sap, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant typically has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in umbels and are usually yellow or greenish in color.</p>
<p>Achyronia lactea is native to various regions in Africa and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia lactea has succulent, fleshy leaves that are oval-shaped, arranged in a rosette pattern, and range in size from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a bluish-green color that often has a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture from the arid environment in which the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia lactea is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in states such as Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with rocky terrain. It is well adapted to dry climates and can survive with minimal water.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to specific ecological zones that provide the right balance of sunlight and drainage.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia lactea was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southern regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in Florida and parts of Texas. The plant was introduced for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to control its spread and mitigate ecological impacts.</p>
