                <h1>Achoriphragma turkestanicum</h1>
<p>Achoriphragma turkestanicum, commonly known as the Turkestan bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid to semi-arid environments. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and it produces small, clustered flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>Achoriphragma turkestanicum is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma turkestanicum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is brown in color and exhibits a creeping or prostrate growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pale yellow petals and stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release minute, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma turkestanicum is primarily native to Central Asia, including regions such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and southern Russia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid environments, particularly in steppes and desert margins. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with dry grasslands and rocky areas. It is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, including extreme temperatures and limited precipitation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the Central Asian steppe and desert ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma turkestanicum was mainly introduced to regions with semi-arid to arid climates, particularly in Central Asia and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments. This plant is commonly used for soil stabilization and erosion control due to its deep root system. It has also been introduced to some areas outside its native range for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited due to its specific ecological requirements.</p>
