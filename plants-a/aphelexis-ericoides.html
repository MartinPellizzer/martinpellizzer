<p>Aphelexis ericoides, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the western coast of North America.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils along coastal areas, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. The plant features small, evergreen leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Aphelexis ericoides is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal dunes.</p>
