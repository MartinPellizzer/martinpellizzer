                <h1>Achillea serbica</h1>
<p>Achillea serbica, commonly known as Serbica yarrow, is a perennial herb native to southeastern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads that range from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with slender, aromatic stems and basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea serbica has basal leaves that are lanceolate to elliptic in shape, with a grayish-green color and a hairy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and somewhat hairy, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. The flowers are small, clustered in flat-topped umbels, with white to pale pink petals, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea serbica is primarily native to the Balkan Peninsula, including countries such as Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, and parts of Greece.</p>
<p>It is also found in regions of Turkey and the Caucasus. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. It is commonly found in mountainous areas with a temperate climate.</p>
<p>Its native range is largely confined to southeastern Europe.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea serbica was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in disturbed soils and roadside environments across the continent. This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to alter local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, Achillea serbica requires careful management to prevent its spread into natural habitats.</p>
