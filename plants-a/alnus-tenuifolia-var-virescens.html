<p>Alnus tenuifolia var. virescens, commonly known as the slender alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often near streams or in wetlands. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they turn yellow in the fall. Its small, catkin-like flowers appear in early spring, and it produces edible seeds that are consumed by various wildlife species.</p>
