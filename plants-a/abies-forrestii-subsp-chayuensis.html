<p>Abies forrestii subsp.</p>
<p>chayuensis, commonly known as the Chayu fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a compact, sub-opposite pattern.</p>
<p>The tree produces cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of the Pinaceae family. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of significant botanical interest due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
