                    <h1>Acrostichum spicatum var. brachystachys</h1>
<p>Acrostichum spicatum var. brachystachys, commonly known as the short-stalked fern, is a variant of the common brake fern.</p>
<p>It is a tropical evergreen fern characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are typically shorter and more compact than those of the typical species. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
