                <h1>Aconitum polycarpum</h1>
<p>Aconitum polycarpum, commonly known as the many-seeded aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, conical inflorescences. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a deeply lobed structure that enhances its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Aconitum polycarpum contains potent alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum polycarpum has compound, bipinnately arranged leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a serrated margin and a palmate base, reaching up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are blue to violet in color, arranged in dense, tall panicles, with showy spurred petals and a short, tubular corolla, blooming from late summer to early autumn and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, adapted for anchoring in rocky or poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum polycarpum is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Sichuan, Hubei, and Hunan provinces. This plant typically grows in mountainous areas with moist, well-drained soils. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its natural range is limited to specific geographic areas within southern-central China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum polycarpum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue flowers and attractive foliage. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in natural ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local biodiversity.</p>
