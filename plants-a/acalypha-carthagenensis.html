                        <h1>Acalypha carthagenensis</h1>
<p>Acalypha carthagenensis, commonly known as the Carthage spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to reddish hues. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in wetlands or near water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
