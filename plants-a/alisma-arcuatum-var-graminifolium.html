                    <h1>Alisma arcuatum var. graminifolium</h1>
<p>Alisma arcuatum var. graminifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshy areas in eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette, with a smooth, waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies that help stabilize shoreline ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an important species in wetland restoration projects.</p>
