                <h1>Acrostichum finlaysonianum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum finlaysonianum, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, bright yellow fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, glossy appearance.</p>
<p>Acrostichum finlaysonianum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum finlaysonianum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a broad, feather-like shape.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and woody with a smooth, pale brown bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>Its fruit is a small, three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum finlaysonianum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and ample sunlight. This plant is commonly found in swampy or wetland habitats, where it forms dense stands along riverbanks and coastal areas. It is also present in parts of Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays an important ecological role in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum finlaysonianum was mainly introduced to disturbed habitats such as roadsides, construction sites, and abandoned agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant has become an invasive species in several regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its spread is often facilitated by human activity and wind dispersal of its spores.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive nature, it poses a threat to local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
