                <h1>Aconitum willdenowii</h1>
<p>Aconitum willdenowii, commonly known as Willdenow's aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces follicles containing elliptical, brown seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum willdenowii has leaves that are compound, typically consisting of 5-7 pairs of lanceolate leaflets, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a rough texture, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes more fissured as the plant matures. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense spikes, with showy petals and a spurred structure, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are small, dark, and dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, often forming a dense network underground.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum willdenowii is primarily native to Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, and parts of Russia. This plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows, forest edges, and along stream banks. It is commonly associated with temperate climates and can be found in both natural and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the regions where its specific ecological requirements are met.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum willdenowii was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been observed in various regions beyond its native range, particularly in temperate climates. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive blue or purple flowers. However, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now expanding as a result of both intentional planting and accidental spread.</p>
