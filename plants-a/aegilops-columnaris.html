<p>Aegilops columnaris, commonly known as the slender wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Aegilops columnaris is valued for its role in ecological restoration and as a forage crop for livestock.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
