                    <h1>Astragalus trojanus</h1>
<p>Astragalus trojanus, commonly known as the Trojan milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect stems and small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>This species is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats.</p>
