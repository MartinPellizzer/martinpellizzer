                    <h1>Aliciella</h1>
<p>Aliciella, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, spiky flower heads and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in coastal environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along coastal regions, thriving in salty air and strong winds. Aliciella species are often found in the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
