                    <h1>Alatiliparis angustiflora</h1>
<p>Alatiliparis angustiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alatiliparis, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific high-altitude regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is slow, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils with full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Alatiliparis angustiflora is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
