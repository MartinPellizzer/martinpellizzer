<p>Allionia rotata, commonly known as the fairy lantern or ghost flower, is a striking member of the Campanulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Caribbean, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its unique, lantern-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a contrasting red or purple throat. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance.</p>
<p>Allionia rotata is also known for its ephemeral blooming period, typically occurring in late spring to early summer, making it a rare and sought-after plant among botanists and gardeners.</p>
