                <h1>Adicea nitida</h1>
<p>Adicea nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and showy white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces small, cylindrical fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Adicea nitida is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea nitida has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a glossy dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and slightly hairy, with a pale green bark that becomes woody with age. Its small, white flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, with four petals and stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea nitida is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas within rainforests and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, often growing as an understory species. It is also present in parts of Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea nitida was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and urban environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including agriculture and land clearing.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
