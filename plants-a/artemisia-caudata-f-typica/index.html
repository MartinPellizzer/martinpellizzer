<p>Artemisia caudata f. typica is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern united states. it is known for its silver-gray foliage and aromatic properties that have been used traditionally by indigenous peoples. this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. its distinctive appearance and resilience make it a popular ornamental and medicinal plant. despite its hardiness, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in certain environments.</p>
