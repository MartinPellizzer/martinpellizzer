                <h1>Acer emeiense</h1>
<p>Acer emeiense, commonly known as the Emei maple, is a species of maple native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions, preferring cool, humid climates with well-drained soil. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often developing shallow fissures with age.</p>
<p>The Emei maple is valued for its ornamental beauty and is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer emeiense has palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>The leaves are large, typically measuring up to 30 cm in diameter, and have a distinctive maple-like shape. The stem is straight and slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters, and they are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread effectively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer emeiense is a deciduous tree native to the Sichuan province of China.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed in the mountainous regions of western Sichuan and western Yunnan, where it thrives in temperate climates. This species prefers moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in mixed forests. It grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acer emeiense is listed as a vulnerable species in the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer emeiense is a deciduous tree known for its striking red leaves and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seed propagation requiring stratification to break dormancy. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, preferring partial to full sun. Fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to maintain shape and health are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigolds can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer emeiense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a complex web of life. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer emeiense plays a role in improving soil quality by facilitating nutrient cycling in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer emeiense is a species of maple tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
