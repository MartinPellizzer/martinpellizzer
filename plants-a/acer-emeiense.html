                <h1>Acer emeiense</h1>
<p>Acer emeiense, commonly known as the Emei maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds. It typically grows in mountainous regions and thrives in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer emeiense has palmately lobed leaves that are broadly ovate with five to seven shallow lobes, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 10-20 cm in length, displaying a vibrant green color in summer and turning yellow or red in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin, flaky layers, and it exhibits a fast-growing pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in upright clusters, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed capsule, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to the structure of the samara.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the plant's growth in mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer emeiense is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan Province in southwestern China.</p>
<p>Its native range is primarily within the Emei Mountain area, where it thrives in a subtropical climate. Currently, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and arboreta around the world, though it remains most commonly found in its native habitat. This plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in temperate to subtropical forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, Acer emeiense is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer emeiense is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seed propagation requiring stratification to break dormancy. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant. Regular fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with scale insects or fungal infections.</p>
<p>Companion planting with nitrogen-fixing plants like legumes can enhance soil fertility and support its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer emeiense is a deciduous tree native to China that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecosystem biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil health and promoting the growth of other plant species. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer emeiense offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing habitat for a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer emeiense is a species of maple tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While its leaves and seeds are not commonly used in culinary applications, the tree contributes to local biodiversity and soil conservation. In traditional Chinese medicine, parts of the tree have been used to treat ailments such as inflammation and respiratory conditions. Economically, it plays a role in reforestation efforts and provides timber for construction and furniture-making.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is admired for its aesthetic appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its visual beauty.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer emeiense has several popular cultivars such as 'Variegatum', known for its striking variegated leaves, and 'Atrovirens', which features deep green foliage with a reddish tint.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, resulting in hybrids like Acer x pensylvanicum, which exhibit enhanced cold hardiness and ornamental value. These varieties and hybrids are highly valued in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions.</p>
<p>Due to their visual appeal and resilience, they play a significant role in landscape design and urban forestry.</p>
