<p>Agropyron diamesum, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It is well-suited to harsh environments due to its deep root system and ability to conserve water.</p>
<p>Agropyron diamesum plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats.</p>
