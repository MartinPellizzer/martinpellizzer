                <h1>Acronema radiatum</h1>
<p>Acronema radiatum, commonly known as the radiate acronema, is a flowering plant native to parts of East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are arranged in umbels, a common feature in the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>The leaves are finely divided and emit a mild, spicy scent when crushed.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronema radiatum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically measuring 2-5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, and arranged in clusters, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema radiatum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in moist, shaded environments like forests and rocky areas. This plant is often associated with mountainous regions and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Acronema radiatum is also known to grow in regions of China and the Philippines.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema radiatum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and areas with disturbed vegetation, such as roadsides and garden beds. The plant thrives in temperate climates and can spread rapidly due to its ability to produce numerous seeds. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered a non-invasive species with limited ecological impact.</p>
