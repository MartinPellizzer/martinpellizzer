<p>The leaves are usually 5–10 cm long and 2–5 cm wide, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter green or slightly reddish underside. The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers with stamens that are longer than the petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
