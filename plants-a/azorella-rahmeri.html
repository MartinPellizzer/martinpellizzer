                    <h1>Azorella rahmeri</h1>
<p>Azorella rahmeri, commonly known as the "Andean moss cushion," is a unique plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, cushion-shaped plant that forms dense mats, often resembling a moss due to its compact growth form. Native to the high-altitude regions of South America, it thrives in cold, arid environments such as the Andes. Its leaves are small, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss, while its flowers are typically yellow or white.</p>
<p>Azorella rahmeri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms in its harsh environment.</p>
