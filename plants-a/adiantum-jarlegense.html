                <h1>Adiantum jarlegense</h1>
<p>Adiantum jarlegense, commonly known as the Jarlegens' maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a distinctive, finely divided structure, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Adiantum jarlegense is valued for its aesthetic qualities and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum jarlegense has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, typically arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually small, measuring up to 10 cm in length, with a light green color that may turn slightly brown at the edges. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a branching pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in late spring, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a spherical capsule that releases tiny, winged seeds through wind dispersal, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum jarlegense is primarily native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of Luzon, particularly in the provinces of Benguet and Ifugao. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments such as montane forests and rocky areas. It is often associated with areas of high biodiversity and is an important component of the local flora.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum jarlegense was mainly introduced to disturbed habitats such as roadsides, gravel areas, and urban environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded conditions and is often found along stream banks and in forest edges. This fern is known for its delicate, feathery fronds and ability to spread rapidly through spores. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various regions beyond its native range.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its competitive growth and ability to colonize new sites quickly.</p>
