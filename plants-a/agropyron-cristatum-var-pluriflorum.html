                    <h1>Agropyron cristatum var. pluriflorum</h1>
<p>Agropyron cristatum var. pluriflorum, commonly known as the tufted wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets. It is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and erosion control capabilities.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this variety make it well-suited for xeriscaping and wildlife habitat enhancement.</p>
