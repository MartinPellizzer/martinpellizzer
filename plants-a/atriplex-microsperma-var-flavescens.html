                    <h1>Atriplex microsperma var. flavescens</h1>
<p>Atriplex microsperma var. flavescens, commonly known as yellow saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of salt-producing glands. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spherical or cylindrical inflorescences. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for stabilizing degraded lands.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptations to harsh, dry environments.</p>
