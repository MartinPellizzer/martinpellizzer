                    <h1>Alopecurus pratensis f. brevisetus</h1>
<p>Alopecurus pratensis f. brevisetus, commonly known as the short-statured meadow grass, is a variant of the meadow foxtail.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stature compared to the typical form. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is typically found in moist meadows and grasslands, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>This form is of interest in botanical studies due to its distinct morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
