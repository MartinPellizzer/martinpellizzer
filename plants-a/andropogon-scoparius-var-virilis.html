<p>Andropogon scoparius var. virilis, commonly known as tall bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blue-green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. This grass is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, making it an important component of native grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Tall bluestem is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in soil stabilization and wildlife habitat.</p>
