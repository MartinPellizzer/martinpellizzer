                <h1>Achnatherum hookeri</h1>
<p>Achnatherum hookeri, commonly known as Hooker's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, rocky slopes, and alpine environments. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing flowers.</p>
<p>Achnatherum hookeri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and small mammals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum hookeri has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 10 to 30 centimeters in length, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, growing in a clumping pattern with a light green to grayish-brown color. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, spikelet structures, appearing in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, and seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum hookeri is primarily native to temperate regions of Asia, including China, Mongolia, and parts of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands, steppes, and open mountainous areas where the climate is dry to semi-arid. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often part of the native vegetation in these ecosystems. It is also occasionally reported in parts of northern India and Nepal.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can be found in a variety of habitats across its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum hookeri was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed grasslands.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high levels of sunlight and well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found in the western United States, particularly in states like California, Nevada, and Utah. It is often associated with agricultural lands and can become invasive in some areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely influenced by human activity and environmental disturbances.</p>
