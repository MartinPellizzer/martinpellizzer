                    <h1>Arnica tomentosa</h1>
<p>Arnica tomentosa, commonly known as the roughleaf arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in alpine environments. Its flowers are typically arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and the stems are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>Arnica tomentosa is valued for its medicinal properties, though it is generally used externally due to its potential skin irritants.</p>
