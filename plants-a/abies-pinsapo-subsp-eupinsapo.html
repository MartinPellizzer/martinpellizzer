<p>Abies pinsapo subsp.</p>
<p>eupinsapo, commonly known as the Canary Island fir, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown.</p>
<p>The tree has needle-like leaves that are dark green and slightly twisted, and its cones are typically reddish-brown when mature. It thrives in humid, cool climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
