                    <h1>Amphoranthus</h1>
<p>Amphoranthus, commonly known as the bottle plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their unique, swollen stems that store water, adapting them to arid environments. The leaves are typically small and often modified into spines, reducing water loss. They produce vibrant flowers in shades of yellow, red, and orange, which bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Amphoranthus species are popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
