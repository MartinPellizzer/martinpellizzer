                    <h1>Agropyron repens var. recurvum</h1>
<p>Agropyron repens var. recurvum, commonly known as hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit and distinctive hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear grass-like flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop.</p>
