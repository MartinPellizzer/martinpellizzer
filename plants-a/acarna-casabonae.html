<p>It is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the base. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Acarna casabonae is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acarna casabonae has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a deep green color and slightly serrated edges.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes more rugged with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to absorb moisture from the soil efficiently.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acarna casabonae is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is currently found only in a few isolated locations within the eastern part of the island. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in forest undergrowth. It grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acarna casabonae is classified as critically endangered.</p>
