                    <h1>Aristolochia hyperborea</h1>
<p>Aristolochia hyperborea, commonly known as the giant Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and unique, pipe-like flowers that are often greenish or reddish in color. The plant produces showy, hooded flowers that attract insects, particularly flies, which are its primary pollinators. Its roots and stems contain aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
