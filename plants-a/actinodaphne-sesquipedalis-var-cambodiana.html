                <h1>Actinodaphne sesquipedalis var. cambodiana</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne sesquipedalis var. cambodiana, commonly known as Cambodian laurel, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly Cambodia.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in tropical and subtropical forest environments. The plant has simple, alternate, and often elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces dark, glossy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its aromatic wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne sesquipedalis var. cambodiana has elliptical or ovate leaves that are glossy green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth with a pale brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, clustered in panicles, and bloom during the rainy season; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a spherical drupe, reddish when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne sesquipedalis var. cambodiana is a rare evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, specifically Cambodia and southern Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed in fragmented habitats within the Cardamom Mountains and parts of the Central Highlands. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in lowland evergreen forests. It grows at altitudes between 200 and 600 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne sesquipedalis var. cambodiana is a slow-growing, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia, valued for its aromatic leaves and ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. The plant has a tropical growth cycle, thriving in warm, humid climates and blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining, loamy soil and consistent moisture without waterlogging, requiring moderate watering during dry periods. Regular fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring and pruning to shape the plant and promote airflow are essential for healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is relatively pest-resistant but may be susceptible to scale insects and fungal diseases in overly wet conditions, and it pairs well with other tropical plants like citrus and pandanus in companion planting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne sesquipedalis var. cambodiana is a valuable plant in its native ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of the local flora. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through mutualistic relationships. Its dense foliage also aids in erosion control by stabilizing soil in forested areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
