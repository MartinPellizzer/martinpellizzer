<p>Aequatorium tovarii, commonly known as the Tovar's morning glory, is a climbing vine native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in vibrant shades of blue and purple. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. Its rapid growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it can be invasive if not controlled.</p>
<p>The seeds are dispersed by birds and animals that eat the fleshy, red berries.</p>
