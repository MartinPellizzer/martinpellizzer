<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses ferns and their allies, known for their primitive features and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many ancient and diverse species with a wide range of morphological adaptations.</p>
<p>Its order is Malvales, a group of flowering plants that includes economically important genera such as cotton and hibiscus. Its family is Malvaceae, commonly known as the mallow family, which includes plants with showy flowers and often hairy leaves. Its genus is Abutilon, a group of flowering plants commonly known as the Chinese lanterns or velvetleafs, characterized by their fuzzy leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Abutilon sinense, a specific type of plant within the genus Abutilon, native to China and known for its distinctive appearance and ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon sinense is primarily native to China South-Central, China Southeast, and Thailand.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or open areas. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the warm and humid climates of southern China and neighboring regions.</p>
