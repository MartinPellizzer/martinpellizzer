                <h1>Aeluropus hirtulus</h1>
<p>Aeluropus hirtulus, commonly known as hairy flatsedge, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Aeluropus hirtulus is adapted to high salinity and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a common species in salt marshes and coastal dunes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeluropus hirtulus has leaves that are linear, narrow, and often hairy, with a grass-like appearance, arranged in a basal rosette, and ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, usually with a gray-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in dense clumps. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, greenish-white florets, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the soil and absorb moisture efficiently.</p>
