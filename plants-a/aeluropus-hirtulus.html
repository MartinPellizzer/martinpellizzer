<p>Aeluropus hirtulus, commonly known as hairy flatsedge, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Aeluropus hirtulus is adapted to high salinity and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a common species in salt marshes and coastal dunes.</p>
