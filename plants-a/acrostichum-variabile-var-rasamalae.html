                    <h1>Acrostichum variabile var. rasamalae</h1>
<p>Acrostichum variabile var. rasamalae, commonly known as the Rasamalae fern, is a rare variant of the variable brake fern.</p>
<p>It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its feathery, delicate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique genetic variation and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
