                <h1>Adenogramma teretifolia</h1>
<p>Adenogramma teretifolia, commonly known as the slender adenogramma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Adenogramma teretifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenogramma teretifolia has leaves that are elongated and lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, bloom during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a shallow network near the soil surface, aiding in moisture absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogramma teretifolia is primarily native to the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>It is found in the region of South Africa, specifically in the Western Cape. This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open, sunny habitats. It is commonly seen in fynbos vegetation, which is characteristic of the area.</p>
<p>Adenogramma teretifolia is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the Cape Provinces.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogramma teretifolia was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its attractive, evergreen foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in tropical and subtropical gardens as a decorative plant. The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it suitable for shaded garden beds and rockeries. Its introduction has been documented in various regions outside its native range, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-invasive species in most areas where it is cultivated.</p>
