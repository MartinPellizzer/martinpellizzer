                <h1>Adicea spathulata</h1>
<p>Adicea spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other composite flowers. The plant features showy yellow flowers surrounded by white ray florets, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes.</p>
<p>Adicea spathulata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea spathulata has leaves that are spatulate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a broad base and tapering tip, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length and 2 to 4 cm in width, and are usually a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly woody, with a smooth, light grey bark that peels off in thin layers as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the spring, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea spathulata is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is now found in various parts of the world, including some regions of the United States, as a result of horticultural introduction. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests or under the canopy of dense vegetation. It is commonly found at low to mid-altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Adicea spathulata is not currently listed as endangered, but its natural habitat faces threats from deforestation and habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adicea spathulata is a striking ornamental plant known for its unique foliage and vibrant flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, blooming within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between sessions. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant and encourage bushiness are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adicea spathulata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit acts as shelter for small insects and birds, contributing to local biodiversity. It also functions as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants by improving soil conditions. Additionally, its fibrous root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along riverbanks and slopes.</p>
<p>Adicea spathulata plays an important ecological role in supporting both plant and animal life in its native habitat.</p>
