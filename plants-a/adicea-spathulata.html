                <h1>Adicea spathulata</h1>
<p>Adicea spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaved adicea, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, making it a valuable addition to gardens and natural habitats.</p>
<p>Adicea spathulata is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea spathulata has leaves that are spatulate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dull green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a pale greenish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea spathulata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments within forests and along stream banks. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often associated with montane and lowland rainforest habitats.</p>
<p>Adicea spathulata is also occasionally found in parts of Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea spathulata was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental dispersal.</p>
<p>It has been reported in regions with warm, moist climates, particularly in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns in some areas. Its introduction has been linked to both intentional cultivation and unintentional spread via shipping or gardening practices.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it poses a potential threat to local ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
