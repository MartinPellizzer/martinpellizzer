<p>Angraecum chloranthum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with a distinctive yellow center and red markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet scent to attract its specific pollinators, primarily the hawkmoth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
