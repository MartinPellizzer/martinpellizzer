                    <h1>Agrostis alba var. pallens</h1>
<p>Agrostis alba var. pallens, commonly known as silver bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silvery-gray blades that give it a distinctive appearance. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and along coastal areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Silver bentgrass is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass mixes.</p>
