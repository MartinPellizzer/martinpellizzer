                <h1>Achillea herba-rota</h1>
<p>Achillea herba-rota, commonly known as yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and flat, composite flower heads that range from white to pink or red. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“90 cm and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Yarrow is known for its medicinal properties, with a long history of use in traditional medicine for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
<p>Its common name is derived from the Greek myth of Achilles, who is said to have used the plant to treat his soldiers' wounds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea herba-rota has basal, fern-like leaves that are compound, with finely divided, gray-green leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern, typically measuring up to 10 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and becomes woody with age, with a light green to reddish-brown bark. Its flowers are borne in flat, spherical clusters called capitula, featuring small, white to pale yellow ray florets surrounded by yellow disk florets, blooming from late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, allowing wind dispersal of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, enabling vegetative propagation and anchoring the plant in soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea herba-rota is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly found in regions such as Spain, Portugal, and parts of southern France.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited, with populations primarily concentrated in isolated areas of the Iberian Peninsula. This species thrives in dry, sunny environments, often growing in rocky soils or on limestone slopes. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, Achillea herba-rota is considered a species of conservation concern in several regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea herba-rota is a hardy perennial plant known for its feathery foliage and delicate yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, division, or stem cuttings, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant has a long growth cycle, blooming in early summer and maintaining a compact form throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or rust, which can be managed with organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea herba-rota is a hardy perennial plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its bright yellow flowers, supporting biodiversity in local ecosystems. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its beneficial properties. Additionally, its dense growth helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>It also contributes to soil health by improving nutrient content through its role in nitrogen fixation.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea herba-rota is a versatile plant known for its historical and modern uses across various domains.</p>
<p>In culinary applications, it is occasionally used in herbal teas and as a flavoring agent due to its subtle aroma.
