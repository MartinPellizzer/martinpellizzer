                <h1>Acidoton virosus</h1>
<p>Acidoton virosus, commonly known as the toxic nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant produces berries that are initially green and turn red as they mature, often mistaken for edible fruits. However, all parts of Acidoton virosus contain toxic alkaloids, making it harmful to both humans and animals.</p>
<p>It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges and waste areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidoton virosus has leaves that are ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size of about 5-7 cm in length and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that exhibits a slight ridged texture, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the surface soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidoton virosus is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This plant is commonly found in the Florida Everglades and other similar habitats across the region. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidoton virosus was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been observed spreading rapidly in disturbed soils and areas with high moisture. The plant's adaptability to various soil types contributes to its invasive potential. It competes with native species for resources, affecting local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to control its spread and mitigate its impact on biodiversity.</p>
