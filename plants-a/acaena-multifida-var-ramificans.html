<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena multifida var. ramificans is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the South Island, particularly in the regions of Canterbury and Otago. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of these areas.</p>
<p>The species is part of the genus Acaena, which is commonly known as New Zealand burr bushes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena multifida var. ramificans was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the ornamental plant trade due to its attractive, fluffy seed heads. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. Its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to invade native ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is considered a potential weed in some parts of the country.</p>
