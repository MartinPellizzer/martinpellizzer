                        <h1>Abies nigra var. nana</h1>
<p>Abies nigra var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf fir, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage that is shorter and more rounded compared to the typical fir species. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that mature to a reddish-brown color, typical of the fir genus. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate makes it an ideal choice for rock gardens or as a decorative plant in woodland settings.</p>
