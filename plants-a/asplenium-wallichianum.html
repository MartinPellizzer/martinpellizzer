                    <h1>Asplenium wallichianum</h1>
<p>Asplenium wallichianum, commonly known as the Indian maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Himalayas and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the substrate.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a leathery texture and a dark green color that contrasts with the lighter veins.</p>
