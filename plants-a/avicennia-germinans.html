                <h1>Avicennia germinans</h1>
<p>Avicennia germinans, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which allow for gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant's leaves are small,革质 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, white flowers that are pollinated by insects and birds.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases buoyant seeds, aiding in coastal dispersion and colonization.</p>
