                        <h1>Acantholimon asphodelinum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon asphodelinum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Acantholimon asphodelinum is often found in rocky soils and is considered a valuable plant for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
