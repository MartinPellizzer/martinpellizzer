                    <h1>Antillanthus eriocarphus</h1>
<p>Antillanthus eriocarphus, commonly known as the Antillean starfruit, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces yellow-orange fruits that are similar in appearance to starfruit, though they are not related to the genus Averrhoa. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
