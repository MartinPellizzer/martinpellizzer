                <h1>Aconitum clairvilleanum</h1>
<p>Aconitum clairvilleanum, commonly known as the Clairville aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and showy, blue to purple flowers. The plant produces smooth, ovate leaves with a velvety texture and is known for its toxic alkaloids, which can be harmful to humans and animals. Aconitum clairvilleanum typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at high altitudes.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value, though care must be taken due to its potent toxicity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum clairvilleanum has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are typically bright green, with a slightly hairy texture, and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark, growing to a height of up to 1.5 meters. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petal-like sepals and numerous stamens, blooming in late summer and attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies through nectar. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, tuberous, and adapted for storing nutrients, allowing the plant to survive in cooler, moist environments.</p>
