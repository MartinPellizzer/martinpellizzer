                <h1>Acrostichum stemaria</h1>
<p>Acrostichum stemaria, commonly known as the broadleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 feet. Its stems are sturdy and often have a reddish hue, while the flowers range in color from white to pink and yellow.</p>
<p>Acrostichum stemaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms and foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum stemaria has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and has a light brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind, allowing the plant to spread over long distances.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping it to anchor in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum stemaria is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland areas, including rainforests and swampy habitats. This plant thrives in environments with high rainfall and warm temperatures throughout the year. It is often associated with mangrove ecosystems and coastal areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its native range extends from the Caribbean islands to the northern regions of South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum stemaria was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It was brought in for its ornamental value due to its attractive, feathery foliage. However, it has since become invasive in wetland areas, outcompeting native plants. The plant thrives in moist, sunny environments and is commonly found in marshes and along waterways.</p>
<p>Its rapid spread has raised concerns among environmentalists and land managers.</p>
