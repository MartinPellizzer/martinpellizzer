                <h1>Abelia serrata var. sanguinea</h1>
<p>Abelia serrata var. sanguinea, commonly known as the red-leaf abelia, is a compact shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely serrated, ovate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, moist soil.</p>
<p>This ornamental plant is valued for its attractive foliage and extended flowering period.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abelia serrata var. sanguinea has elliptical to ovate leaves that are opposite in arrangement, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, measuring approximately 2-5 cm in length and 1-2 cm in width, and a dark green color on the upper surface with a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother and lighter as the plant matures, and they grow in an upright, bushy pattern. The flowers are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences, with showy, tubular pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. The fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelia serrata var. sanguinea is a variant of the abelia plant native to southern China, particularly in the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan.</p>
<p>While it was originally found in its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of the United States. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often growing in forest understories. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, it is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, although its wild populations are becoming less common due to habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abelia serrata var. sanguinea is a vibrant, flowering shrub known for its pink and red blooms that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through softwood cuttings taken in late spring or early summer, which root easily in a mix of peat and perlite. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 3 to 5 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and regular watering, especially during dry periods, but should not be overwatered. Fertilize it in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Abelia serrata var. sanguinea is a shrub that provides nectar and berries, serving as a valuable food source for birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies, due to its showy pink flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring flora through its dense foliage and root system. Its shallow roots also help in erosion control by stabilizing soil in moist or wet areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by offering shelter and habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
