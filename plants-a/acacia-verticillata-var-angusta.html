                <h1>Acacia verticillata var. angusta</h1>
<p>Acacia verticillata var. angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf golden wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, feather-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in spherical heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in horticulture for its hardiness and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia verticillata var. angusta has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in whorls of three to five along the stems, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are yellow, clustered in spherical or cylindrical heads, and bloom from late winter to early spring, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a woody pod that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant to access water in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia verticillata var. angusta is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia, Angola, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is now found across much of southern Africa, including parts of Zimbabwe, Botswana, and Kenya, often in disturbed or degraded habitats. This species thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found in open woodlands, shrublands, and along riverbanks. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, it is listed as a vulnerable species in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia verticillata var. angusta is a compact, ornamental shrub known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 2 to 3 years, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended for optimal health and appearance.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be susceptible to scale insects and root rot if overwatered, and it pairs well with drought-tolerant companion plants like lavender or sedum.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acacia verticillata var. angusta is a shrub that provides food and shelter for a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds with its nectar-rich flowers. The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, improving soil fertility and supporting other plant growth. Its dense root system also helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land.</p>
<p>Additionally, it serves as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and ecological balance.</p>
