                <h1>Adenophora hakusanensis</h1>
<p>Adenophora hakusanensis, commonly known as the Japanese bellflower, is a perennial herb native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adenophora hakusanensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora hakusanensis has leaves that are lanceolate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a medium size ranging from 3 to 7 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and somewhat woody at the base, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age. The flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in loose inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora hakusanensis is primarily native to the Korean Peninsula, including both North and South Korea.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of northeastern China, particularly in regions such as Jilin and Liaoning provinces. This plant typically grows in mountainous areas with cool, moist climates. It thrives in shaded or semi-shaded environments, often in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches, making it a rare and specialized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora hakusanensis was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, particularly in parts of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous areas and forest edges where it thrives in partial shade. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive blue-violet flowers. It has been introduced to several countries beyond its native range, including the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain environments.</p>
