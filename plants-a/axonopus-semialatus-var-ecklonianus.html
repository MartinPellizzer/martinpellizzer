<p>Axonopus semialatus var. ecklonianus, commonly known as Ecklon's axonopus, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant features slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its small, pale green flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
