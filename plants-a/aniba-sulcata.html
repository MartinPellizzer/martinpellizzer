                    <h1>Aniba sulcata</h1>
<p>Aniba sulcata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood, which is highly valued in musical instrument making. The plant has simple, alternate, elliptic leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. It produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as critically endangered in its native habitat.</p>
