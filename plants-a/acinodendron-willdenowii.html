                <h1>Acinodendron willdenowii</h1>
<p>Acinodendron willdenowii, commonly known as the African sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Moraceae, which includes figs and mulberries. The plant features large, palmate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its fruit is a small, round, fleshy structure that contains seeds.</p>
<p>Acinodendron willdenowii is valued for its timber and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron willdenowii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a shallow network near the soil surface, aiding in water absorption during dry periods.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron willdenowii is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, forested areas and along riverbanks. This species thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with secondary growth habitats and is sometimes found in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into parts of Central and Southern Africa as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron willdenowii was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in countries such as Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It was introduced primarily as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and potential for use in landscaping. However, it has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction have raised concerns among conservationists.</p>
