                <h1>Acianthera foetens</h1>
<p>Acianthera foetens, commonly known as the stinking acianthera, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers that emit a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are ovate and glossy, while its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soils.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal despite its pungent scent.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera foetens has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth texture and a light green to yellowish color, growing upright with some branching. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white or pale pink petals and a strong, unpleasant odor, blooming in the summer months and pollinated primarily by flies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera foetens is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This orchid species is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of southeastern Brazil. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often within the Atlantic Forest biome. The plant is known for its small, fragrant flowers and is typically associated with rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to this specific region within Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera foetens was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, pastures, and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including land clearing and gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
