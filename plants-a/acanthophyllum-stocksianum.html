                        <h1>Acanthophyllum stocksianum</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum stocksianum, commonly known as the Stock's jointed sage, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features dense, gray-green foliage with small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces compact, showy clusters of violet to blue-purple flowers during the spring and early summer.
