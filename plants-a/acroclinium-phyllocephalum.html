                <h1>Acroclinium phyllocephalum</h1>
<p>Acroclinium phyllocephalum, commonly known as the broad-leaved acroclinium, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Acroclinium phyllocephalum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acroclinium phyllocephalum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light green to pale yellow color, and grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are tubular with a showy purple hue, featuring five petals and a prominent yellow center, blooming in the summer months and primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroclinium phyllocephalum is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of southern Florida, United States. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils in tropical and subtropical climates. It is commonly associated with coastal areas and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific regions in the Caribbean and southeastern United States.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroclinium phyllocephalum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its showy, tubular flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its introduction has led to its establishment in natural areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
