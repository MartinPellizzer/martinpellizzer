<p>Asparagus nelsii, commonly known as the silver feather asparagus, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white绒毛, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in late spring, followed by red berries that attract birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid climates.</p>
