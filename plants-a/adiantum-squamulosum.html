                <h1>Adiantum squamulosum</h1>
<p>Adiantum squamulosum, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a delicate and ornamental fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in small, scale-like structures, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to rocky or forest substrates.</p>
<p>Adiantum squamulosum is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum squamulosum has fern-like leaves that are pinnate, with a delicate, finely divided structure, typically ranging from 10 to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a leathery texture. They are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender, wiry, and often covered in a thin, smooth, grayish-brown bark. This plant does not produce flowers; instead, it reproduces via spores, and its reproductive structures are hidden within the leaf fronds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, helping to anchor the plant and absorb moisture from the surrounding environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum squamulosum is primarily native to Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Andean regions of the country. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. It is often seen growing on stream banks and in humid mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the highlands of Bolivia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum squamulosum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. This fern is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, lace-like fronds. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California.</p>
<p>Its introduction is likely due to its ornamental value and adaptability to temperate climates.</p>
