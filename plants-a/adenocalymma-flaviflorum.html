                <h1>Adenocalymma flaviflorum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma flaviflorum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and woodlands, and is often found in regions with a temperate climate.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma flaviflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma flaviflorum has leaves that are simple, alternate, and ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the late winter to early spring, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma flaviflorum is primarily native to Brazil North, Brazil Northeast, Colombia, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>This plant is found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. It typically grows in lowland areas with humid climates. The species is commonly associated with moist forests and savannas.</p>
<p>Its distribution spans across much of northern and northeastern South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma flaviflorum was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Western Cape and other regions with a Mediterranean climate. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and seed production contribute to its spread.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to control its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
