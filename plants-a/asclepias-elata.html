<p>Asclepias elata, commonly known as showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Asclepias elata plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae.</p>
