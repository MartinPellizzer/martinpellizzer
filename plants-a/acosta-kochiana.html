                <h1>Acosta kochiana</h1>
<p>Acosta kochiana, commonly known as the Mexican rock cactus, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stem and spiny appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its flowers, which are usually yellow or orange, bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Acosta kochiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta kochiana has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a slight roughness as it ages, and it grows in a climbing or trailing pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta kochiana is primarily native to the Andean region of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude areas, typically between 2,500 and 4,000 meters above sea level. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often associated with alpine vegetation. It is part of the Apiaceae family and is known for its distinctive umbellate inflorescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta kochiana was mainly introduced to areas with specific environmental conditions such as well-drained soil and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates, particularly in parts of South America. This plant has been introduced to several locations outside its native range for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage. It thrives in environments with moderate temperatures and low humidity.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
