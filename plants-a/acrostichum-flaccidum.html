                <h1>Acrostichum flaccidum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum flaccidum, commonly known as the limp fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its long, slender fronds that often appear limp or drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture.</p>
<p>Acrostichum flaccidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum flaccidum has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, with a wavy margin and a dark green, glossy upper surface, while the underside is pale and hairy.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement, varying in size from 10 to 30 cm in length, and are often drooping or hanging. The stem is slender and fibrous, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows in a creeping or climbing pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-lobed, spiny capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum flaccidum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of freshwater bodies where there is abundant moisture. This plant is commonly found in areas with rich, humid climates and is often associated with riparian zones. It is also occasionally present in parts of the Caribbean and the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to its preference for waterlogged soils and warm, humid environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum flaccidum was mainly introduced to coastal areas and wetlands in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as dunes and tidal marshes. This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about ecological impacts on local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor and control its spread to protect native plant communities.</p>
