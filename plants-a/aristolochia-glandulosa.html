                    <h1>Aristolochia glandulosa</h1>
<p>Aristolochia glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, hooded flowers that resemble a pipe, with a distinctive, intricate pattern inside. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, musty odor, which helps attract its primary pollinator, the pipevine swallowtail butterfly.</p>
<p>The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making it important to handle with care.</p>
