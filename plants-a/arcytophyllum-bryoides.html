<p>Arcytophyllum bryoides, commonly known as the mossy sage, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Arcytophyllum bryoides is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions.</p>
