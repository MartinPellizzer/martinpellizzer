                <h1>Acer fabri var. rubrocarpum</h1>
<p>Acer fabri var. rubrocarpum, commonly known as the red-leaf maple, is a variant of the Chinese maple species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red foliage, which becomes more vivid in the fall. The plant is native to China and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a serrated margin, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>The tree thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for landscape design.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer fabri var. rubrocarpum has palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-7 lobes, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and arranged in catkins, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer fabri var. rubrocarpum is a rare variant of the Chinese maple, native to the mountainous regions of western China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas. It thrives in temperate climates, typically found in moist, well-drained soils within forests or on rocky slopes. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited natural regeneration, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer fabri var. rubrocarpum is a striking ornamental maple known for its vibrant red foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant exhibits a slow to moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning should focus on shaping and removing dead or diseased branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its ornamental value and provide ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer fabri var. rubrocarpum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing the overall health of the ecosystem. Its extensive root system helps in erosion control, stabilizing soil and preventing land degradation.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and supporting a diverse range of flora and fauna.</p>
