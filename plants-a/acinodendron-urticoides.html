                <h1>Acinodendron urticoides</h1>
<p>Acinodendron urticoides, commonly known as the stinging nettle tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stinging hairs on the leaves and stems, which can cause irritation upon contact with the skin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The species has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron urticoides has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 2 to 6 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a rough, hairy texture and a greenish-brown color, growing in a bushy pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals and a tubular structure, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule containing small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron urticoides is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Cameroon, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, lowland rainforest areas and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid environments with high rainfall and is often associated with secondary growth forests. It is also occasionally found in parts of Southeast Asia, though its distribution there is less extensive.</p>
<p>The species plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron urticoides was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
