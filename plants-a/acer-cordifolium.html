                <h1>Acer cordifolium</h1>
<p>Acer cordifolium, commonly known as the heart-leaved maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree typically grows to a height of 10 to 20 meters, with a spreading crown and smooth, gray bark. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow catkins that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular ornamental tree in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer cordifolium has heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-10 cm in length, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface that turns yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and smooth, with a greyish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer cordifolium is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, primarily China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited due to habitat loss and fragmentation. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from human activity, Acer cordifolium is listed as a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer cordifolium is a deciduous tree known for its heart-shaped leaves and vibrant fall color.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period to germinate. The growth cycle includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its ornamental value in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
