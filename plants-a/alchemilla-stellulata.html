<p>Alchemilla stellulata, commonly known as star-leaved ladyâ€™s mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that form a dense, mat-like structure. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender stalks. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties.</p>
<p>Alchemilla stellulata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats.</p>
