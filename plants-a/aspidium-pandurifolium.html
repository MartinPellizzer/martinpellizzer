<p>Aspidium pandurifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are often submerged in water, with a distinctive veining pattern. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Aspidium pandurifolium plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
