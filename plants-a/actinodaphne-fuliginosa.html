                <h1>Actinodaphne fuliginosa</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne fuliginosa, commonly known as the black sand laurel, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and elliptical, glossy leaves. It produces small, clustered white flowers followed by spherical, black berries.</p>
<p>Actinodaphne fuliginosa is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental qualities and traditional uses in local cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne fuliginosa has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 5 to 12 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that exudes a faintly aromatic scent. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round drupe that turns from green to yellowish when mature, dispersing its seeds through animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, aiding in water absorption and soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne fuliginosa is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this island, which is part of the Malay Archipelago. This species thrives in humid and warm climates, typically in lowland to mid-elevation areas. It is often associated with secondary growth and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a regionally important species within Borneo's biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne fuliginosa was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of Oceania.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly cultivated for its aromatic leaves and potential medicinal properties. Its introduction has been associated with both horticultural interests and traditional use in local communities.</p>
<p>However, its spread outside native habitats requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
