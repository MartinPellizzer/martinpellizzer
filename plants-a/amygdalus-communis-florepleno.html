                    <h1>Amygdalus communis florepleno</h1>
<p>Amygdalus communis florepleno, commonly known as the double-flowered almond tree, is a cultivar of the almond species characterized by its ornamental double flowers.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that produces showy, fragrant blooms in shades of white and pink during late spring. The plant is closely related to the common almond (Prunus dulcis) and belongs to the Rosaceae family. While it is primarily grown for its aesthetic value, it does not produce edible almonds.</p>
<p>The double-flowered trait results from a genetic mutation that leads to the formation of multiple petals around the flower.</p>
