                    <h1>Anguina villosula</h1>
<p>Anguina villosula, commonly known as the hairy root gall nematode, is a microscopic parasitic nematode that primarily affects plants in the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It induces the formation of galls on the roots of its host plants, which are abnormal growths caused by the nematode's feeding activity. The galls provide a protected environment for the nematode to develop and reproduce, often leading to reduced plant growth and yield. This species is particularly problematic in agricultural settings where crops like cabbage, cauliflower, and radish are grown.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves several stages, including egg, infective juveniles, and adult nematodes, all of which contribute to its impact on plant health.</p>
