                    <h1>Aspidium craspedosorum var. mandshuricum</h1>
<p>Aspidium craspedosorum var. mandshuricum, commonly known as the Siberian water fern, is a variant of the broad buckwheat fern.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features delicate, feather-like fronds that are usually biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the spore-bearing fronds in the second. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variant is native to parts of Asia, including Russia and China, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats.</p>
