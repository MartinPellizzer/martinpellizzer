<p>Abies fabri var. beshanzuensis, commonly known as the Beshanzu fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are closely arranged along the branches. The cones of this species are typically small and cylindrical, maturing to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often growing in dense forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
