                <h1>Acrostichum borbonicum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum borbonicum, commonly known as the Bourbon fern, is a tropical plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique trait makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum borbonicum has broad, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and measure up to 30 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and upright, with a smooth, dark brown bark that develops shallow grooves as the plant matures. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the dry season, relying on wind pollination for reproduction. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind, allowing the plant to spread effectively in open habitats.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, enabling it to anchor firmly in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum borbonicum is primarily native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this biodiversity-rich region. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within the dense canopy of the forest. It is commonly found in the eastern and southern parts of Madagascar.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat is characterized by high rainfall and nutrient-rich soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum borbonicum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions due to its adaptability to warm climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats where it can thrive in moist, sandy soils. This plant is often used in landscaping for its attractive foliage and ability to stabilize soil. Its introduction has sometimes led to invasiveness in non-native areas, requiring careful management.</p>
<p>The distribution of Acrostichum borbonicum is closely tied to human activities such as horticulture and land development.</p>
