                    <h1>Anthelepis paludosa</h1>
<p>Anthelepis paludosa, commonly known as the swamp fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>Anthelepis paludosa plays a significant ecological role in maintaining the integrity of wetland ecosystems.</p>
