                <h1>Acianthera capanemae</h1>
<p>Acianthera capanemae, commonly known as the Capanema violet, is a rare orchid species native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the Atlantic Forest biome. Its flowers are relatively small but highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera capanemae has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, with three petals and a tubular structure, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera capanemae is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the southeastern part of Brazil. It typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant is known for its delicate flowers and is often found in areas with rich organic soil.</p>
<p>It is a rare and endemic species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera capanemae was mainly introduced to areas with suitable tropical or subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded or semi-shaded environments, making it a common sight in forest understories or along the edges of wetlands. The plant is often found in areas with moderate to high rainfall, which supports its growth and flowering cycles. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to various horticultural gardens and greenhouses around the world.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native ecosystems.</p>
