                    <h1>Asplenium × vogelii</h1>
<p>Asplenium × vogelii, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium × vogelii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions.</p>
