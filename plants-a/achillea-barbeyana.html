                <h1>Achillea barbeyana</h1>
<p>Achillea barbeyana, commonly known as the Barbey's yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun conditions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Its flowering period usually occurs in the summer months, adding a delicate touch to alpine landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea barbeyana has leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a greyish-green color and a woolly texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark, and exhibits a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale pink to white ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene, dispersed by wind due to its lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea barbeyana is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and parts of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>While it was originally found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and it is now considered extinct in the wild, with only a few cultivated specimens remaining. It thrives in dry, rocky, and sunny environments, typically growing at high altitudes between 1,500 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and restricted habitat, Achillea barbeyana is classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to prevent its complete disappearance.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea barbeyana is a perennial plant known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of yellow flowers, commonly cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rhizomes or by sowing seeds in early spring. The plant has a dormant growth cycle, with active growth occurring in spring and flowering in early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea barbeyana is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both nectar and a habitat for nesting. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its beneficial properties. It also contributes to erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea barbeyana offers ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health through its natural processes.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea barbeyana is a flowering plant commonly known as the yellow archangel, which has various uses and applications.</p>
<p>In the culinary realm, its leaves and flowers can be used to make herbal teas and are sometimes added to salads for a subtle, peppery flavor.
