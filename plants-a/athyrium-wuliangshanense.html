                    <h1>Athyrium wuliangshanense</h1>
<p>Athyrium wuliangshanense, commonly known as the Wuliangshan Athyrium, is a species of fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Athyriaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
