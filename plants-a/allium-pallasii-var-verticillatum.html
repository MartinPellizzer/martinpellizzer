                    <h1>Allium pallasii var. verticillatum</h1>
<p>Allium pallasii var. verticillatum, commonly known as the spiral garlic, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of narrow, grass-like leaves and its clusters of pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, rounded bulbs that are edible and resemble garlic in flavor, though they are less commonly cultivated for culinary use. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique floral display and hardy nature.</p>
