<p>Acacia moirii subsp.</p>
<p>recurvistipula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and phyllodes that are narrow and recurved at the tips.</p>

<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
