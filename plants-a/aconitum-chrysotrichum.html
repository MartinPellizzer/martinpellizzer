                <h1>Aconitum chrysotrichum</h1>
<p>Aconitum chrysotrichum, commonly known as the golden hairroot monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It features striking purple to blue flowers clustered in racemes, surrounded by distinctive, hood-like petals. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are deeply lobed, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>However, it is highly toxic, containing potent alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum chrysotrichum has leaves that are typically compound, with a palmate arrangement, and they are often large, measuring up to 30 cm in diameter, with a dark green color and a silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, rough to the touch, and has a dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, and have a spurred structure, blooming in late summer to early autumn, primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, contributing to the plant's toxicity and its ability to thrive in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum chrysotrichum is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of this area, including parts of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool and moist conditions. It is often found in forests and meadows at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 3,500 meters.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat is characterized by well-drained soils and partial to full shade.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum chrysotrichum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically in woodland or forested regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous or alpine environments. This plant is known for its striking yellow and green flowers, which make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. It has been introduced to various parts of Europe and North America, where it has sometimes become naturalized.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
