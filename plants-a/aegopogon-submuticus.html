                <h1>Aegopogon submuticus</h1>
<p>Aegopogon submuticus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. It is an herbaceous perennial that produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as schizocarps.</p>
<p>Aegopogon submuticus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegopogon submuticus has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
