                        <h1>Acacia smallii</h1>
<p>Acacia smallii, commonly known as the small's wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, yellow flower heads that bloom in spring. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf-like structures that serve as the primary means of photosynthesis. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Acacia smallii is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that plays an important role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia smallii is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the southern coast, including areas such as the Fitzgerald River National Park and the Cape Leeuwin area. This species thrives in coastal dune environments and is adapted to the saline and arid conditions of its habitat. It is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in stabilizing dune systems.</p>
<p>Acacia smallii is also found in parts of South Australia, though its distribution is more restricted compared to its range in Western Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia smallii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can grow in both full sun and partial shade.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal have raised concerns among conservationists.</p>
