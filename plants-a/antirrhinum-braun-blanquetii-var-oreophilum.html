                    <h1>Antirrhinum braun-blanquetii var. oreophilum</h1>
<p>Antirrhinum braun-blanquetii var. oreophilum, commonly known as the oreophilic snapdragon, is a rare and striking member of the Plantaginaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. Native to specific high-altitude regions in the Iberian Peninsula, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees, due to their shape and nectar production.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
