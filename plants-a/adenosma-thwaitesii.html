                <h1>Adenosma thwaitesii</h1>
<p>Adenosma thwaitesii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved adenosma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches.</p>
<p>Adenosma thwaitesii is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma thwaitesii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly pubescent surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light green to brownish color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with five petals that are white or pale pink, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma thwaitesii is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland areas with high humidity and warm temperatures. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forests or along riverbanks. It is particularly associated with the Malay Peninsula and the southern parts of the Indochina Peninsula.</p>
<p>Adenosma thwaitesii is also known to occur in parts of the Philippines and New Guinea.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma thwaitesii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species that has spread across various regions of the country. The plant was likely introduced through human activities, such as accidental transport or intentional cultivation. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests and grasslands, which contributes to its rapid spread.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its growth to prevent further ecological disruption.</p>
