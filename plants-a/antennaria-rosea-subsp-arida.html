<p>Antennaria rosea subsp.</p>
<p>arida, commonly known as the arid sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate habit, with small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant has hairy, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptations to extreme conditions, it is an important species in ecological studies of desert flora.</p>
