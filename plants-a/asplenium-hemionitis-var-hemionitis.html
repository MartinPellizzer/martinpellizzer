                    <h1>Asplenium hemionitis var. hemionitis</h1>
<p>Asplenium hemionitis var. hemionitis, commonly known as the silver spleenwort, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, linear pinnae that give it a delicate appearance.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
