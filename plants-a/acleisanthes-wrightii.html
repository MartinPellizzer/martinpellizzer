                <h1>Acleisanthes wrightii</h1>
<p>Acleisanthes wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring succulent leaves and a deep root system for water conservation. It often grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes wrightii has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and are typically white or pale pink, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes wrightii is primarily native to Mexico Northeast and Texas.</p>
<p>This species is found in the southern United States, particularly in the arid and semi-arid regions of Texas. It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly seen in desert scrub and grassland habitats. The plant is adapted to the dry climate and can tolerate periods of drought.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within its native range, making it a rare and localized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes wrightii was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. This species is considered an invasive plant in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It prefers full sun and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
