                <h1>Adinandra dumosa</h1>
<p>Adinandra dumosa, commonly known as the African hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2â€“5 meters. The plant features simple, ovate leaves with a smooth surface and produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow and red. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
<p>Adinandra dumosa is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra dumosa has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, woody, and covered with a rough, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through bird consumption and subsequent seed ejection.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra dumosa is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, primarily found in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely restricted to fragmented habitats due to deforestation and habitat loss. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil, typically found in lowland and hill forests. Adinandra dumosa grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>The species is listed as endangered due to its limited range and ongoing threats from habitat destruction and overexploitation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adinandra dumosa is a hardy, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia, valued for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-ripe cuttings, with the latter method yielding faster results. The plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, thriving in warm, humid conditions and requiring full to partial sun.</p>
<p>For optimal growth, it prefers well-drained, fertile soil and should be watered regularly but allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize it with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season, and prune selectively to maintain shape and encourage bushier growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care and companion planting with marigolds or garlic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adinandra dumosa is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity by creating a microhabitat for smaller organisms. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil fertility through organic matter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Adinandra dumosa is a versatile plant with various uses across different domains.</p>
<p>In culinary applications, its leaves are used in traditional dishes, adding flavor and nutritional value. Medicinally, it has been utilized in local remedies to treat ailments such as inflammation and digestive issues. Industrially, its wood is valued for its durability, making it useful in construction and furniture making.</p>
