                <h1>Adinandra dumosa</h1>
<p>Adinandra dumosa, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its wood is valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra dumosa has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elliptical to ovate leaflets that are glossy green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and twining, with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth habit. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in axillary inflorescences, blooming during the rainy season, and they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra dumosa is primarily native to Borneo, Jawa, Malaya, and Sumatera.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical rainforests of these regions. It thrives in humid and shaded environments, typically along the forest floor or in undergrowth. Adinandra dumosa is part of the Rubiaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the Southeast Asian archipelago.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra dumosa was mainly introduced to urban and coastal areas due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its tolerance to salt spray.</p>
<p>It is commonly found along roadsides, construction sites, and in areas with heavy foot traffic. The plant has become naturalized in several regions, often outcompeting native vegetation in degraded habitats. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a potential invasive species in some environments.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping.</p>
