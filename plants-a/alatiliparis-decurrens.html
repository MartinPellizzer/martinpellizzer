                    <h1>Alatiliparis decurrens</h1>
<p>Alatiliparis decurrens, commonly known as the creeping marshplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats along the surface of shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, helping to repel water and reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>Alatiliparis decurrens plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
