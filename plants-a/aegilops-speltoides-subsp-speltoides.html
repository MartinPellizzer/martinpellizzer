<p>Aegilops speltoides subsp.</p>
<p>speltoides, commonly known as wild einkorn, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a diploid plant with a genome size of approximately 1.5 gigabases.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish flowers. It is closely related to cultivated einkorn wheat and has been used in genetic research for its contribution to wheat improvement.</p>
<p>This species is also valued for its potential in developing new crop varieties with improved traits.</p>
