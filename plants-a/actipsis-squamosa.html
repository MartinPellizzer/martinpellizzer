                <h1>Actipsis squamosa</h1>
<p>Actipsis squamosa, commonly known as the scaly actipsis, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a robust, branched stem covered in small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Actipsis squamosa is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actipsis squamosa has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a rough, hairy texture on the upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown in color, and it grows in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actipsis squamosa is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal and inland dunes. This plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low rainfall. It is often seen growing in open, sunny habitats with minimal vegetation cover.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actipsis squamosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand through human activity, particularly during the 19th century as part of European colonization.</p>
<p>It is now found in various habitats, including grasslands and disturbed areas, across the North and South Islands. The plant has spread primarily through seed dispersal by wind and animals, contributing to its rapid colonization of new environments. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems, though it is not currently classified as invasive.</p>
<p>Ongoing monitoring is necessary to assess its ecological effects in the region.</p>
