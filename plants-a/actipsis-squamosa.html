                    <h1>Actipsis squamosa</h1>
<p>Actipsis squamosa, commonly known as the scaly actipsis, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a robust, branched stem covered in small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Actipsis squamosa is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
