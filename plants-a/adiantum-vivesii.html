                <h1>Adiantum vivesii</h1>
<p>Adiantum vivesii, commonly known as the Vives' maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or humus-rich substrates. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are covered in small, kidney-shaped structures called sorus.</p>
<p>Adiantum vivesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum vivesii has fern-like leaves that are pinnate, with a delicate, finely divided structure, and they are typically arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green, with a slender, upright growth habit, and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. The stem is slender and somewhat wiry, with a smooth, light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more reddish with age. Adiantum vivesii produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the leaves; it does not produce true flowers, so pollination is not applicable.</p>
<p>The plant does not produce fruits or seeds, as it reproduces through spores released from the sori, and its root system consists of fibrous roots that help anchor it to moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum vivesii is primarily native to Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It is found in the island's mountainous regions, particularly in the Cordillera Central. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments within the tropical rainforests. It is commonly observed in areas with high moisture and rich, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species to the island.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum vivesii was mainly introduced to regions with moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it suitable for temperate climates. This plant is commonly found in mountainous regions where it forms dense, low-growing colonies. Its introduction has been noted in parts of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has also been cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections worldwide.</p>
