                    <h1>Adiantum vivesii</h1>
<p>Adiantum vivesii, commonly known as the Vives' maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or humus-rich substrates. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are covered in small, kidney-shaped structures called sorus.</p>
<p>Adiantum vivesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
