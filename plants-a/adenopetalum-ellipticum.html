                <h1>Adenopetalum ellipticum</h1>
<p>Adenopetalum ellipticum, commonly known as the narrowleaf false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Adenopetalum ellipticum thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenopetalum ellipticum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopetalum ellipticum is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Texas. This plant typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, including grasslands and woodlands. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Adenopetalum ellipticum is commonly associated with limestone and clay soils in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopetalum ellipticum was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, clearings, and along stream banks. This plant thrives in dry to moist soils and is often seen in open habitats. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range, posing ecological challenges in certain areas.</p>
