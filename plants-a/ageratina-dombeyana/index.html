                            <h1>Ageratina Dombeyana</h1>
<p>Blue mistflower, scientifically known as Ageratina dombeyana, is a strikingly beautiful plant native to the southeastern United States. It is prized for its delicate, bluish-gray flowers that resemble a soft mist, giving it its common name. This perennial plant thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking both ornamental value and ecological benefits. Despite its beauty, it is also an important plant for pollinators and contributes to local biodiversity.</p>
