<p>Alchemilla brachyclada, commonly known as narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and western Asia.</p>

The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Its leaves are covered with a waxy coating that gives them a silvery appearance, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Alchemilla brachyclada is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks.</p>
