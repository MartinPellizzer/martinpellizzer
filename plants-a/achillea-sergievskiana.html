                <h1>Achillea sergievskiana</h1>
<p>Achillea sergievskiana, commonly known as the Siberian yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant features finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that are aromatic when crushed. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or alpine gardens.</p>
<p>Achillea sergievskiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea sergievskiana has leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a grayish-green color and a silvery-white underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and covered with fine hairs, exhibiting a reddish-brown color, and grows in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk florets surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sergievskiana is primarily native to Altay, Mongolia.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of this area, where it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. It is commonly associated with high-altitude grasslands and slopes. The species is adapted to the cold and dry climate typical of the Altay region.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to this specific geographical area in Mongolia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sergievskiana was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fern-like foliage and showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas, particularly in regions with temperate climates. Although it is not native to these areas, it has been widely cultivated for its aesthetic value. However, in some regions, it has escaped cultivation and become naturalized, raising concerns about its potential invasive behavior.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to areas where it is intentionally planted, but its spread is being closely monitored.</p>
