                <h1>Adicea microphylla</h1>
<p>Adicea microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved adicea, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its small, oval leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Adicea microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea microphylla has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea microphylla is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments within forest understories and along stream banks. The plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained, fertile soils. It is often associated with montane and lowland forests, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Adicea microphylla is also occasionally found in parts of southern Arabia and the Middle East.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea microphylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since spread throughout various regions of the country. The plant thrives in a range of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. It has become naturalized in several areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, its invasive potential remains a topic of ongoing ecological study.</p>
