                <h1>Acinodendron lechleri</h1>
<p>Acinodendron lechleri, commonly known as the copal tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America, particularly in regions of Peru and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers and is known for its latex sap, which has been traditionally used by indigenous communities for various purposes.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for numerous species and contributing to soil stability in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron lechleri has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 10â€“20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron lechleri is primarily native to the Amazon rainforest region of South America.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, and Brazil. This species thrives in the humid and warm climates of the tropical lowland and foothill areas. It is commonly found in dense forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with the ecological conditions of the Amazon basin.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron lechleri was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with rainforests. Its introduction has been driven by its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native areas.</p>
