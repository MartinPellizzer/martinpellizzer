                <h1>Acrostichum proliferum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum proliferum, commonly known as the giant waterfern, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas rapidly.</p>
<p>Acrostichum proliferum plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and shelter for various water organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum proliferum has broad, feather-like leaves that are typically lance-shaped, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and can grow up to 3 meters in length, with a deep green color.</p>
<p>Its stems are slender, upright, and covered in a smooth, light green bark, growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, blooming during the spring and early summer, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed, three-winged samara that disperses its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, swampy environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum proliferum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangrove forests, and tidal zones where it thrives in brackish or saline water conditions. This plant is well adapted to the humid and warm climate of its native habitat. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with coastal ecosystems along the eastern and southern coasts of the Indian Ocean.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum proliferum was mainly introduced to coastal areas and wetlands in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish or freshwater environments, often growing along the edges of ponds, marshes, and tidal flats. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, which can alter local ecosystems. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common sight in wetland restoration projects.</p>
