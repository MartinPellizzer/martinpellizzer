                <h1>Adenocrepis tetrandra</h1>
<p>Adenocrepis tetrandra, commonly known as the four-threaded sandmat, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming species that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Adenocrepis tetrandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocrepis tetrandra has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elliptical leaflets that are usually green and slightly hairy.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat woody, with a rough texture and a greyish-brown color, growing in a bushy pattern. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense umbels, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocrepis tetrandra is primarily native to southern Europe, particularly the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France.</p>
<p>It is also found in North Africa, including countries such as Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and coastal areas. It is commonly associated with Mediterranean climates and is well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Adenocrepis tetrandra is a member of the Asteraceae family and is known for its yellow flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocrepis tetrandra was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a weed in some areas. The plant spreads through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
