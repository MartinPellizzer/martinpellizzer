                <h1>Acuan glandulosum</h1>
<p>Acuan glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky acuan, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glandular hairs that give its stems and leaves a sticky texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a lanceolate shape.</p>
<p>Acuan glandulosum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acuan glandulosum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly pubescent surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a light green to reddish-brown color, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming during the spring season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acuan glandulosum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland forest environments where it receives ample sunlight and consistent moisture. This plant is commonly found in the understory of primary and secondary forests, often near the forest floor. Its distribution is closely linked to areas with rich organic soil and a warm, tropical climate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its native range has become increasingly fragmented in recent years.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acuan glandulosum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and along streambanks. The plant has become naturalized in several regions outside its native range. Its rapid growth and adaptability have made it a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread into sensitive ecosystems.</p>
