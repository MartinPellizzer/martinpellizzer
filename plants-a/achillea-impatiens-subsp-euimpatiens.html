<p>Achillea impatiens subsp.</p>
<p>euimpatiens, commonly known as the European yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring a basal rosette of grey-green, aromatic leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces flat-topped clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are finely divided and have a strong, medicinal scent, while its roots are often used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in meadows and along roadsides.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea impatiens subsp.</p>
<p>euimpatiens has leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes grayish underside. The stems are upright, herbaceous, and have a slightly hairy texture, growing in a clump-forming pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray flowers, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's spread.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea impatiens subsp.</p>
<p>euimpatiens is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in the Alps and adjacent areas of Italy and Austria. Its current distribution has expanded beyond its native range, with sightings in parts of North America and other temperate regions where it has been introduced.</p>
<p>This species thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and widespread presence, it is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea impatiens subsp.</p>
<p>euimpatiens is a hardy perennial known for its vibrant yellow flowers and compact growth. It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the root clumps in early spring.</p>
<p>This plant has a rapid growth cycle, blooming in mid-summer and dying back in winter, making it ideal for seasonal gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering promote bushier growth, while common pests like aphids and diseases such as powdery mildew should be monitored.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>
