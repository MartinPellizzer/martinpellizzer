                        <h1>Acacia incerta</h1>
<p>Acacia incerta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a small shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and narrow, feathery leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Acacia incerta is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia incerta is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, arid, and semi-arid regions, often found in savannas and woodlands. This plant is commonly associated with rocky soils and can be found in coastal areas as well. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various animals.</p>
<p>Acacia incerta is also known for its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia incerta was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in various soil conditions.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in native forests and coastal regions. The plant's rapid growth and seed dispersal have led to its classification as an environmental weed in some parts of the country. Acacia incerta competes with native vegetation, potentially altering local ecosystems and reducing biodiversity.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on natural habitats.</p>
