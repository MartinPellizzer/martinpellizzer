                    <h1>Astragalus scleroxylon</h1>
<p>Astragalus scleroxylon, commonly known as the hard-seed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by hard, woody pods that contain small, round seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid ecosystems.</p>
