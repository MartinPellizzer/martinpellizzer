<p>Asplenium × aprutianum, commonly known as the Aprutian spleenwort, is a hybrid fern that originates from the Italian region of Abruzzo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, intricately divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native habitat.</p>
