<p>Asclepias prolifera, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release silky, parachute-like seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Asclepias prolifera is a key host plant for the larvae of the monarch butterfly, making it ecologically significant.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to arid environments makes it a hardy and resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
