                <h1>Acosta bovina</h1>
<p>Acosta bovina, commonly known as the Bovine Acosta, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to red. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks or in dense undergrowth. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture.</p>
<p>Acosta bovina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta bovina has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a deep green color and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta bovina is primarily native to the Andean region of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, often found in the Andes Mountains. This plant is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of these regions and is commonly found in elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 meters. It is an important species in local ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta bovina was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, pastures, and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and is commonly found in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant has been reported in several countries in South America, including Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas make it a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>However, it is often used for erosion control due to its dense root system and tolerance to poor soil conditions.</p>
