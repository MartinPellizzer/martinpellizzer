                    <h1>Austrotaxus</h1>
<p>Austrotaxus, commonly known as the southern tamarack, is a rare coniferous tree native to southern South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the cypress family (Cupressaceae) and is characterized by its scale-like leaves and small, spherical cones. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in temperate regions. Austrotaxus is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often reaching heights of up to 20 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
