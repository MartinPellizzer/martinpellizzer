<p>Arenaria aggregata subsp.</p>
<p>aggregata, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by rounded, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are succulent and often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
