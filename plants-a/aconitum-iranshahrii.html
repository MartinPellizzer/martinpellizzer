                <h1>Aconitum iranshahrii</h1>
<p>Aconitum iranshahrii, commonly known as the Iranian aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are typically arranged in racemes. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, wavy margin.</p>
<p>Like other aconites, it contains potent alkaloids, making it toxic to both humans and animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum iranshahrii has large, palmately compound leaves that are broadly ovate to rounded in shape, with a deep green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and covered with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to violet in color, with a spurred petal and numerous stamens, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases small, flat seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous, thick, and fleshy, adapted for storing nutrients and water.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum iranshahrii is primarily native to Iran.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the western and central parts. This species thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. It is commonly found in rocky soils and forested areas.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely linked to the unique ecological conditions of Iran's diverse landscapes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum iranshahrii was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, where it can thrive in moist, partially shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous areas with cool summers and cold winters, typical of its native habitat in Iran. This plant prefers nutrient-rich soils and is often associated with rocky or forested landscapes. Its introduction has been primarily for ornamental purposes due to its striking blue to purple flowers.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that it can be toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
