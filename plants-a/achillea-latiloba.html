                <h1>Achillea latiloba</h1>
<p>Achillea latiloba, commonly known as narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and flat-topped clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and thrives in well-drained, sunny soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Achillea latiloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea latiloba has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, dark green in color, and have a rough texture, arranged in a rosette pattern and ranging in size from 5 to 15 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and reddish-brown in color, with a growth pattern that is mostly herbaceous. The flowers are yellow in color, consisting of a central disk surrounded by ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea latiloba is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>Currently, it is also found in parts of southern Russia and western China, though its distribution has become fragmented. It thrives in dry, rocky, and grassland environments, often growing in sunny, well-drained soils. This species typically occurs at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea latiloba is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea latiloba is a hardy perennial known for its showy yellow flowers and aromatic foliage, commonly grown in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing established clumps, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining plant vigor. This plant has a summer growth cycle, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Regular watering is needed during dry periods, but overwatering should be avoided to prevent root rot. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer encourages robust growth, while deadheading and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if conditions are too damp.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like rosemary or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea latiloba is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both nectar and habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. It also contributes to erosion control due to its dense root system, which stabilizes soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it supports biodiversity by creating a habitat for small insects and providing shelter for other wildlife.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea latiloba is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, known for its ornamental value and use in landscaping.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, some species of the genus Achillea have been historically used in cooking, though this is less common with A. latiloba specifically. In traditional medicine, it has been used for its potential antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties, though scientific validation is limited. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and supports pollinators, playing a role in ecological conservation.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is often associated with the myth of Achilles and has symbolic meanings related to healing and protection.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea latiloba has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aurea' and 'Moonshine,' known for their striking yellow foliage and delicate white flowers. While there are fewer hybrids specifically developed for Achillea latiloba compared to other species in the genus, some crosses have been made to enhance flower color and disease resistance. These cultivars and hybrids are widely used in gardens for their low maintenance and ability to thrive in various soil conditions.</p>
<p>Their horticultural importance lies in their ability to attract pollinators and add visual interest to landscapes.</p>
