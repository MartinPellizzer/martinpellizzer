                <h1>Achillea latiloba</h1>
<p>Achillea latiloba, commonly known as narrow-leaved yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and flat-topped clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its aromatic foliage and long blooming period from late spring to early autumn make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Achillea latiloba is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea latiloba has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a silver-gray color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a greenish-gray bark, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea latiloba is a flowering plant native to the western United States, primarily found in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of western North America, though it is now considered rare. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. This species typically grows at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea latiloba is listed as endangered or vulnerable in several regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea latiloba is a hardy perennial known for its fluffy, yellow flowers and ability to thrive in diverse conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, division, or stem cuttings, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. This plant has a dormant growth cycle, typically blooming in late spring to early summer and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer supports growth, while regular pruning after blooming helps maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea latiloba is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, which contribute to the ecosystem's biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other wildflowers to enhance overall garden or natural area health. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea latiloba offers ecological benefits by supporting local insect populations and contributing to the aesthetic value of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea latiloba is a flowering plant native to the western United States, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it serves as a valuable nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. In traditional medicine, it has been used for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties, though scientific validation remains limited. Its role in landscaping and habitat restoration highlights its industrial and economic significance in sustainable gardening and ecological conservation.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and natural beauty, often featured in native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea latiloba has several popular cultivars such as 'Pink Beauty' and 'Silver King,' which are prized for their striking foliage and extended flowering period.</p>
<p>While it is less commonly hybridized compared to other yarrow species, some horticultural hybrids have been developed to enhance disease resistance and flower color. These cultivars are widely appreciated in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Due to their hardiness and low maintenance, Achillea latiloba and its cultivars hold significant horticultural importance in landscape design.</p>
<p>They are often used in perennial borders and as ground cover in rock gardens.</p>
