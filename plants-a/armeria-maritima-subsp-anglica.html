<p>Armeria maritima subsp.</p>
<p>anglica, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing evergreen perennial shrub native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has succulent, needle-like leaves that help it retain moisture in its salty, windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines.</p>
<p>Sea thrift is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize coastal soils.</p>
