<p>Anathallis pemonum, commonly known as the Pemon ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has small, strap-like leaves and produces fragrant, white or pale pink blossoms.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat and conservation status, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
