                <h1>Achillea flosculosa</h1>
<p>Achillea flosculosa, commonly known as the slender yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in alpine or grassland habitats. It produces small, white to pale yellow flower heads that bloom in summer, and its leaves are finely divided with a strong, peppery scent.</p>
<p>Achillea flosculosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea flosculosa has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a bluish-gray upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a greenish-gray bark with a rough texture. Its flowers are small, yellowish-white composite heads arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea flosculosa is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of western China.</p>
<p>While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited and fragmented, with populations found mainly in isolated areas of these regions. It thrives in dry, rocky, and well-drained soils, typically in alpine or subalpine environments. This species is often found at altitudes ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for further research and protection efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea flosculosa is a hardy perennial known for its delicate, flat-topped flowers and ability to thrive in sunny, well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer, ensuring a robust and healthy growth cycle. This plant prefers sandy or loamy soils with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring supports vigorous growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new blooms.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, making it a good companion plant for echinacea or lavender, which share similar growing conditions.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea flosculosa is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering food and shelter. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and supporting biodiversity in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea flosculosa is a flowering plant known for its medicinal properties, often used in traditional medicine to treat ailments such as inflammation and digestive issues.</p>
