<p>Aconitum napellus f. glabratum, commonly known as the glabrous monkshood, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive hood-shaped blue or purple flowers and smooth, glabrous stems, which distinguish it from other aconite varieties. Native to parts of Europe, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed divisions, and its flowers typically bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>
