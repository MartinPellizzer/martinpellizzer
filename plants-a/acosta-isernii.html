                <h1>Acosta isernii</h1>
<p>Acosta isernii, commonly known as the Iberian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. It is a perennial herb with a compact growth habit and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta isernii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or arid soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta isernii is primarily native to the Andean region of South America, specifically in countries such as Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the high-altitude grasslands and mountainous areas of the Andes. This plant thrives in temperate to cold climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta isernii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and human-altered landscapes, such as roadsides, urban waste areas, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high levels of sunlight and well-drained soil. This plant is often found in regions with a temperate climate, particularly in the Mediterranean Basin and parts of southern Europe. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including land development and the movement of soil and plant materials.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native flora.</p>
