                <h1>Acer interior</h1>
<p>Acer interior, commonly known as the interior maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10-20 meters and prefers well-drained soils in sunny to partially shaded locations.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often planted in gardens and natural landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer interior has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length, with a doubly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, turning yellow in the fall. The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in racemes, and they are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod, which disperses by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer interior is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of western North America, specifically found in parts of Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely restricted to its native range due to habitat loss and environmental changes. It thrives in dry, rocky environments with well-drained soil, often growing in open woodlands or on slopes. This species is typically found at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat fragmentation, Acer interior is considered a species of concern and is listed as vulnerable in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer interior is a delicate and ornamental maple species that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The growth cycle of Acer interior includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining, slightly acidic soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or hostas can enhance its aesthetic appeal and create a lush, shaded garden environment.</p>
