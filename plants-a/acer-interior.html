                        <h1>Acer interior</h1>
<p>Acer interior, commonly known as the interior maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, red-orange samaras that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental planting.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, Acer interior is often found in mixed hardwood forests and alpine environments.</p>
