                <h1>Achyronia nodosa</h1>
<p>Achyronia nodosa, commonly known as the nodding achyronia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a small annual herb that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia nodosa has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows in a creeping or ascending pattern. Its flowers are clustered in small inflorescences, featuring pale yellow petals and stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia nodosa is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and coastal areas, often growing in well-drained soils. The plant thrives in sunny environments and is adapted to withstand dry and saline conditions. Its distribution includes countries such as Spain, Italy, Greece, and Turkey.</p>
<p>It is also present in some regions of the Middle East and northern Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia nodosa was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of the United States and Europe. The plant's introduction is often associated with its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types. However, it has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is still being studied to better understand its ecological impact.</p>
