                <h1>Aellenia hispidula</h1>
<p>Aellenia hispidula, commonly known as the roughleaf senna, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are pinnately compound and covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture.</p>
<p>The species is part of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing abilities and ecological importance in arid regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aellenia hispidula has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dull green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with fine, stiff hairs, and has a pale green to reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green, with five petals and stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for moist, well-drained soils.</p>
