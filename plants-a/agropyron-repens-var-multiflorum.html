<p>Agropyron repens var. multiflorum, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a bluish-green color, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Agropyron repens var. multiflorum is valued for its erosion control capabilities and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
