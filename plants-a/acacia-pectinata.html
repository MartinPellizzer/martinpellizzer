                        <h1>Acacia pectinata</h1>
<p>Acacia pectinata, commonly known as the white wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Acacia pectinata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought resistance through its deep root system.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its role in ecological systems and as a source of nectar for pollinators.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia pectinata is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and parts of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in savannas, grasslands, and rocky outcrops where it thrives in dry conditions. This plant is well adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Acacia pectinata is also sometimes cultivated in areas where its hardy nature makes it suitable for reforestation and land stabilization projects.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia pectinata was mainly introduced to areas with semi-arid to arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the inland parts of Western Australia and South Australia. This plant is often used for soil stabilization due to its deep root system and ability to tolerate drought. Its introduction has also been noted in some parts of Southeast Asia for ornamental and ecological purposes.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native environments.</p>
