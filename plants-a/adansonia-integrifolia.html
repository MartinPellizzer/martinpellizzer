                <h1>Adansonia integrifolia</h1>
<p>Adansonia integrifolia, commonly known as the baobab tree, is a distinctive species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The tree has large, umbrella-like leaves and produces yellow, edible flowers that develop into fruit with a pulp rich in nutrients. Its bark is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and protection against fire.</p>
<p>Adansonia integrifolia plays a vital role in the ecosystem, offering shelter and food to various animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adansonia integrifolia has large, simple, broad leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and columnar, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that is fibrous in texture and grows vertically. Its flowers are large, showy, and white or pale yellow, with a complex structure consisting of multiple petals and stamens, blooming from October to December and pollinated by bats. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the tree to anchor itself and access water in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adansonia integrifolia is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the dry, arid regions of the island, particularly in the south-central and western parts. This species is commonly associated with rocky outcrops and dry forests. It thrives in areas with low rainfall and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Adansonia integrifolia is one of the most iconic species of the baobab family in Madagascar.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adansonia integrifolia was mainly introduced to areas with warm, dry climates and well-drained soils, often found in regions with seasonal rainfall.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments where it can receive ample sunlight and has access to sufficient water during the growing season. This species is commonly found in rocky or sandy soils, making it adaptable to arid and semi-arid regions. Its introduction has been primarily for ornamental purposes due to its distinctive appearance and ability to withstand harsh conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that it is not native to these regions and can sometimes become invasive if not properly managed.</p>
