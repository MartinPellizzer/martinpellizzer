                    <h1>Acacia calderonii</h1>
<p>Acacia calderonii, commonly known as the Calderon's wattle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and small, feathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow, fluffy flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Acacia calderonii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
