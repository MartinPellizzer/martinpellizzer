                <h1>Acer lobelii subsp. pictum</h1>
<p>Acer lobelii subsp.</p>
<p>pictum, commonly known as the painted maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that often display vibrant red, orange, or yellow hues in the fall.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage and seasonal color changes contribute to its aesthetic appeal in gardens and natural habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer lobelii subsp.</p>
<p>pictum has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The leaves are typically a vibrant green during the growing season and turn brilliant red or orange in the fall.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white or pale yellow petals, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule, which disperses by wind, and the roots are shallow, fibrous, and adapted to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer lobelii subsp.</p>
<p>pictum is a rare and striking maple species native to the western United States, specifically found in California and Oregon. While its original range was limited, it is now primarily found in the Sierra Nevada foothills and coastal ranges of California.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils in mixed evergreen forests and open woodlands. It typically grows at elevations between 600 and 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is listed as endangered in California, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer lobelii subsp.</p>
<p>pictum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red leaves and compact growth habit. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period to break dormancy. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with light feeding in early spring, and pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot under poor conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or other drought-tolerant plants can enhance its beauty and ecological benefits in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer lobelii subsp.</p>
<p>pictum is a unique plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It also offers shelter and habitat for various small wildlife species, contributing to biodiversity in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>This plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its beneficial interactions. Additionally, its extensive root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along streambanks and moist habitats. Overall, Acer lobelii subsp.</p>
<p>pictum plays a crucial ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining the health of wetland environments.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer lobelii subsp.</p>
<p>pictum is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of South America, known for its striking red and yellow foliage. While it is primarily valued for its aesthetic appeal in horticulture and landscaping, it has limited direct culinary uses.</p>
<p>Historically, some indigenous communities may have used parts of the plant for medicinal purposes, though specific applications are not well documented. Its unique appearance makes it a symbol of biodiversity and conservation efforts in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Overall, its primary role remains in ecological and ornamental contexts rather than industrial or widespread economic applications.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer lobelii subsp.</p>
<p>pictum has several popular cultivars, including 'Aureum' and 'Variegatum', which are prized for their striking yellow and variegated foliage. It is also a parent species in various hybrids, such as with Acer ginnala, producing ornamental trees with unique leaf patterns.</p>
<p>These hybrids are often used in horticulture for their aesthetic value and adaptability to different garden conditions. The species and its cultivars are important in landscape design due to their ornamental appeal and seasonal color changes.</p>
<p>Horticultural importance is further enhanced by their ability to thrive in partial shade and their relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
