                <h1>Adenocalymma pliciflorum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma pliciflorum, commonly known as the pleated-flowered adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its unique, pleated leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma pliciflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma pliciflorum has leaves that are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light brown bark that peels off in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma pliciflorum is primarily native to eastern South America, specifically Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the regions of the Brazilian Cerrado and the Atlantic Forest. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with dry to moist habitats, including grasslands and woodlands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific geographic areas within South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma pliciflorum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique and attractive foliage. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become a weed in some regions, posing a threat to native ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and spreads rapidly through its rhizomes.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the importance of monitoring non-native species for their potential ecological impact.</p>
