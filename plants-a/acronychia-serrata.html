                <h1>Acronychia serrata</h1>
<p>Acronychia serrata, commonly known as the serrated acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern Australia, particularly the coastal regions of New South Wales and Queensland. The plant is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. It produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by orange or red berries.</p>
<p>Acronychia serrata is often found in coastal heathlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia serrata has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and serrated margins.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern and vary in size from 5 to 15 cm in length. The stem is slender and woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that exfoliates in thin layers. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in axillary inflorescences, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia serrata is primarily native to northeastern Australia, including parts of Queensland and the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>It is also found in New Guinea and the surrounding islands of the Indo-Pacific region. This plant typically grows in coastal rainforests and moist, shaded environments. It is commonly associated with sandy or rocky soils in these regions.</p>
<p>Acronychia serrata is a small to medium-sized tree that plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia serrata was mainly introduced to coastal and lowland areas of eastern Australia, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rainforest margins and open forests. The plant is commonly used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and hardy nature. It is also valued for its timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has led to some concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain environments.</p>
