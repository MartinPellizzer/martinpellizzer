<p>Actinochloa procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate leekgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically green or pale blue, and it blooms during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Actinochloa procumbens is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland habitats.</p>
