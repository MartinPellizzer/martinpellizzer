                <h1>Actinochloa procumbens</h1>
<p>Actinochloa procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate leekgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically green or pale blue, and it blooms during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Actinochloa procumbens is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinochloa procumbens has small, narrow leaves that are typically linear to lanceolate in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and range in size from 1 to 3 centimeters in length, with a pale green to bluish-gray coloration.</p>
<p>The stem is prostrate, with a smooth, light green to reddish-brown bark that grows along the ground, often rooting at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, with a simple structure featuring three sepals and three petals, blooming during the spring and early summer; it is pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's spread and anchoring it in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinochloa procumbens is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest understories and along stream banks. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and moderate rainfall. It is often associated with limestone soils and is a common component of montane and lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed outside of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinochloa procumbens was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as a potential forage crop due to its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it has since become a weed in agricultural areas, competing with native plants. The plant's rapid growth and seed dispersal have contributed to its spread across the country.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to manage its population to prevent further ecological impact.</p>
