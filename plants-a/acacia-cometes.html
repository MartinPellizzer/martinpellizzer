                        <h1>Acacia cometes</h1>
<p>Acacia cometes, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is part of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Acacia cometes is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing food and habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia cometes is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in savannas and shrublands. This plant is well adapted to the harsh climate, with its deep root system allowing it to access water from deeper underground. It plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is also sometimes cultivated in other regions with similar environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia cometes was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and as a windbreak in degraded lands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions where it thrives in poor soil conditions. The plant has been widely planted in several countries for its rapid growth and hardiness. However, its introduction has sometimes led to the displacement of native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, it requires careful management to prevent ecological imbalances.</p>
