<p>Adenia stolzii, commonly known as the African star jasmine, is a climbing shrub native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a star-like appearance. Its fruits are fleshy berries that contain several seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Adenia stolzii thrives in humid, shady environments and is valued for its ornamental qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia stolzii has leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is usually brown to reddish-brown in color, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with a yellowish-green color and a distinctive scent, blooming during the rainy season and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains numerous small seeds, dispersed mainly by birds and mammals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, often forming a dense network to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia stolzii is primarily native to Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, and Zambia.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It thrives in humid, forested environments with well-drained soil. Adenia stolzii is often encountered in the understory of dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the natural habitats of eastern and central Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia stolzii was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and northern Australia. This plant thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique foliage and occasional flowering make it a sought-after addition to botanical collections.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential invasiveness in non-native habitats.</p>
