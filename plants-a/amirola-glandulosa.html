                    <h1>Amirola glandulosa</h1>
<p>Amirola glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky leaf shrub, is a species native to the humid lowland forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, glandular-stemmed structure, which gives it a distinctive waxy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are often covered in fine, sticky hairs that aid in moisture retention and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Amirola glandulosa is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
