                <h1>Acanthus mollis subsp. mollis</h1>
<p>Acanthus mollis subsp.</p>
<p>mollis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acanthus, is a hardy perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, grayish-white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, spiny bracts that enclose clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its architectural form and ornamental value make it a valued addition to both cultivated and natural landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acanthus mollis subsp.</p>
<p>mollis has large, lobed leaves that are usually heart-shaped or ovate, with a wavy margin and a velvety texture, arranged in a basal rosette. The stem is upright, with a smooth, grayish-green bark that becomes woody with age, and it grows from the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, pale blue to violet petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthus mollis subsp.</p>
<p>mollis is a perennial herb native to southern Europe, particularly the Mediterranean region, including countries such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece. Its current distribution includes parts of North Africa and the Middle East, where it has been introduced and sometimes naturalized.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky soils and coastal areas, often growing in dry, sunny environments along cliffs and in scrublands. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level up to about 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>It is considered to be of least concern for conservation status, as it is widespread and relatively common in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acanthus mollis subsp.</p>
<p>mollis is a striking perennial plant known for its lush foliage and dramatic spires of soft, pastel flowers. It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes in early spring. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, reaching maturity within one growing season and blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry out between waterings. Fertilize it in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune dead foliage after flowering to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs, which can be controlled with organic methods.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acanthus mollis subsp.</p>
<p>mollis is a hardy, ornamental plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects. Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through improved soil conditions. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, its dense foliage offers habitat and protection for small animals and insects.</p>
