                    <h1>Asclepias davisii</h1>
<p>Asclepias davisii, commonly known as Davis's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the milkweed family, Asclepiadaceae, and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-orange flowers that attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, a common feature among milkweeds. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments.</p>
<p>Davis's milkweed plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems, particularly for the monarch butterfly, which relies on it as a host plant for its larvae.</p>
