                <h1>Acrotrema arnottianum</h1>
<p>Acrotrema arnottianum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems.</p>
<p>Acrotrema arnottianum is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotrema arnottianum has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively unchanging throughout the plant's growth. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and a yellow center, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotrema arnottianum is primarily native to India.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions across the country, particularly in the southern and eastern parts. This plant typically grows in moist and shaded environments, such as forests and shrublands. It is commonly associated with humid climates and is often found in areas with high rainfall.</p>
<p>Its native range in India highlights its adaptation to the country's diverse ecological conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotrema arnottianum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in temperate climates and has shown adaptability to different environmental conditions. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including land development and transportation infrastructure.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is now considered a weed in several regions where it has established itself.</p>
