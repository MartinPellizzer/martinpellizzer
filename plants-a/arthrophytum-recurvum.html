                    <h1>Arthrophytum recurvum</h1>
<p>Arthrophytum recurvum, commonly known as the silver leaf cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, branching structure composed of cylindrical stems covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, a typical adaptation to minimize water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Arthrophytum recurvum is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils.</p>
