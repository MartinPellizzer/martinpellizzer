<p>Abrus precatorius, commonly known as the Indian rue or bead tree, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, ornate, and often brightly colored seed pods that contain toxic, bead-like seeds. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has compound leaves with three to five leaflets. Its seeds contain abrin, a potent lectin toxin that can be lethal if ingested.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid consumption of any part of it.</p>
