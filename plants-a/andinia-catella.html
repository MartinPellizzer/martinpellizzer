                    <h1>Andinia catella</h1>
<p>Andinia catella, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a compact, slow-growing plant with a stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, and it relies on specific bird species for seed dispersal. Andinia catella is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
