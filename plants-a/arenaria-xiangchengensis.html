<p>Arenaria xiangchengensis, commonly known as the Xiangcheng sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the summer months, which are typically clustered in racemes. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a fine layer of hair, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Arenaria xiangchengensis is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in rocky or semi-desert areas.</p>
