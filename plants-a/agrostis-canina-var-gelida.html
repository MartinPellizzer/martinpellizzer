                    <h1>Agrostis canina var. gelida</h1>
<p>Agrostis canina var. gelida, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. This variety is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in rocky or well-drained soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments and is often found in mountain meadows and tundra regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage grass in cooler climates.</p>
