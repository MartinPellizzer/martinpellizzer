                <h1>Acer ukurunduense var. changbaishanense</h1>
<p>Acer ukurunduense var. changbaishanense, commonly known as the Changbai Mountain maple, is a rare variant of the Ukurundu maple native to the mountainous regions of northeastern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red to orange-red leaves that turn vibrant in the fall, making it a visually distinctive species. The plant typically grows in cool, humid climates at high altitudes, often in forested areas with well-drained soil. Its leaves are usually palmately lobed, with serrated edges, and its bark is smooth and reddish-brown in texture.</p>
<p>This species is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer ukurunduense var. changbaishanense has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 5 to 12 cm in length; they are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellowish-green sepals and red stamens, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara with a winged structure, dispersing by wind, and the seeds are small and light, allowing for effective aerial dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer ukurunduense var. changbaishanense is a rare and endemic species native to the Changbai Mountains in northeastern China.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations within this region, primarily in the Korean Peninsula and the northern parts of China. It thrives in cool, humid environments with rich, well-drained soils, typically found in mixed forests. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat fragmentation and limited natural propagation, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer ukurunduense var. changbaishanense is a rare and ornamental tree native to the Changbai Mountains, known for its striking foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of this tree is slow, with significant development occurring over several years, making it suitable for long-term landscaping projects.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and requires regular watering during the growing season, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be controlled with appropriate organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or other shade-loving plants can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer ukurunduense var. changbaishanense is a rare and ecologically significant plant native to the Changbaishan region, providing food and shelter for local wildlife, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of surrounding flora by improving soil conditions. Its deep root system helps in erosion control, stabilizing the soil on mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance by supporting a diverse array of life forms in its native habitat.</p>
