                <h1>Adinandra sadaui</h1>
<p>Adinandra sadaui, commonly known as the Sadau tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The tree is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra sadaui has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra sadaui is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the lowland and hill forest areas of this island. The plant thrives in tropical rainforest environments with high humidity and adequate rainfall. It is commonly observed in the understorey vegetation of these forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within Borneo, particularly in Malaysia and Brunei.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra sadaui was mainly introduced to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the dry deciduous forests of the eastern part of the island. The plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and receives partial sunlight. It is often used in local traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>However, its distribution is limited due to habitat fragmentation and environmental changes.</p>
