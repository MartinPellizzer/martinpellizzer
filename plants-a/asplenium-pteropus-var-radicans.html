<p>Asplenium pteropus var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on moist, shaded surfaces such as rocks, walls, or tree trunks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
