                <h1>Achyronia capillaris</h1>
<p>Achyronia capillaris, commonly known as the slender false nettle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Onagraceae family and typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features slender, hairy stems and small, opposite leaves with a slightly serrated edge. Its flowers are usually pink or white, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia capillaris has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length; they are usually a dull green with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, light green bark that becomes more woody with age. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia capillaris is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often associated with disturbed or swampy habitats. It is particularly common in the southeastern United States, from Florida up through the Carolinas and into parts of Ohio.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to regions with consistent moisture and suitable hydrological conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia capillaris was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in coastal areas and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its introduction has led to competition with native plants, altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become established in both natural and human-altered environments.</p>
