                    <h1>Armeria brachyphylla</h1>
<p>Armeria brachyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has linear, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Armeria brachyphylla is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in sandy or gravelly environments.</p>
