                            <h1>Alseodaphne Oblanceolata</h1>
<p>Alseodaphne oblanceolata is a rare and distinctive plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes well-known species like cinnamon and avocado. This evergreen tree is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and fragrant, small white flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
