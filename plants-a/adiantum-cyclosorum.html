                <h1>Adiantum cyclosorum</h1>
<p>Adiantum cyclosorum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocky outcrops or in woodland areas. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantum cyclosorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum cyclosorum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with a delicate, lace-like appearance and a light green color.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-yellow in color, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum cyclosorum is primarily native to the eastern United States, including states such as Georgia, Florida, and parts of Alabama.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments like forests and along stream banks. This fern thrives in humid climates and is often seen in the understory of deciduous forests. It is also present in some areas of the Caribbean, particularly in the Bahamas and Cuba.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the southeastern region of North America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum cyclosorum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. This plant is commonly found in the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its delicate, fern-like foliage.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not properly managed.</p>
