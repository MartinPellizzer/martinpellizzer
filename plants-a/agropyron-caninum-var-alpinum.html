<p>Agropyron caninum var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps stabilize soil in harsh environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving at high altitudes where temperatures are cold and conditions are extreme. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its resilience and is often used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
