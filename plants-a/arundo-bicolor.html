                    <h1>Arundo bicolor</h1>
<p>Arundo bicolor, commonly known as the giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking variegated leaves, which display a mix of green, white, and sometimes pink hues. The plant can grow up to 6 meters in height and is often found near water sources such as rivers and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable ornamental plant and an invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in late summer, and they are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
