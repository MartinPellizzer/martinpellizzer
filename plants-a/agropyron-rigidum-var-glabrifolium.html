                    <h1>Agropyron rigidum var. glabrifolium</h1>
<p>Agropyron rigidum var. glabrifolium, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically hairless, giving it the specific epithet *glabrifolium*, and it is adapted to thrive in dry, nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
