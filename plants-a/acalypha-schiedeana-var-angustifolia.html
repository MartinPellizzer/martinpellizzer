<p>Acalypha schiedeana var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and vibrant yellow-orange bracts.</p>
<p>It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves with hairy surfaces, and its flowers are small and inconspicuous, surrounded by showy, modified leaves called bracts. It is part of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its diverse and often striking floral structures.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha schiedeana var. angustifolia has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, with a smooth, light green bark that tends to become slightly woody with age. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers with stamens that are prominent, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha schiedeana var. angustifolia is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed in similar tropical and subtropical regions, often found in disturbed habitats like edges of forests, clearings, and along riverbanks. This species thrives in humid environments with high rainfall and partial to full sunlight, typically growing at altitudes between 200 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as endangered in some regions, though it remains relatively common in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
