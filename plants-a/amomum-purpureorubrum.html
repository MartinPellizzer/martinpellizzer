                    <h1>Amomum purpureorubrum</h1>
<p>Amomum purpureorubrum, commonly known as the purple-red cardamom, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking purple-red flowers that bloom in terminal inflorescences, adding ornamental value to gardens. Its rhizomes, similar to those of other ginger species, are often used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>However, it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental appeal rather than its culinary or medicinal uses.</p>
