<p>Abronia villosa, commonly known as the hairy bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, as well as its distinctive seed pods that resemble bladders. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Abronia villosa plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insects.</p>

<p>Abronia villosa belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises vascular plants with a diverse range of growth forms, including ferns and horsetails. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species such as roses and magnolias.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, which consists of flowering plants often with showy flowers and includes families like the cacti and nightshade. Its family is Nyctaginaceae, known as the four-o'clock family, which includes plants with vibrant flowers that open in the late afternoon. Its genus is Abronia, a group of flowering plants native to the Americas, typically characterized by their showy, often red or orange flowers.</p>
