                    <h1>Aspidium costaricanum</h1>
<p>Aspidium costaricanum, commonly known as the Costa Rican water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
