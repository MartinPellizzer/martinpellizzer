                    <h1>Asclepias weddellii</h1>
<p>Asclepias weddellii, commonly known as the Weddell's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces specialized structures called milkweed pods, which contain seeds attached to silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. It serves as a critical host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species.</p>
<p>Asclepias weddellii is also noted for its latex-like sap, which contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores.</p>
