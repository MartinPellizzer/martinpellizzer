                <h1>Acronia isthmica</h1>
<p>Acronia isthmica, commonly known as the Isthmian acronia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia isthmica has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a smooth surface and a glossy green color, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white in color, with five petals and a tubular structure, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia isthmica is primarily native to the Isthmus of Panama.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of Central America, specifically along the narrow strip of land connecting North and South America. This plant thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and high rainfall. Its distribution is limited to a small geographic range, making it a regionally significant species.</p>
<p>It is often found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats within this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia isthmica was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and urban environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate temperatures and well-drained soil conditions. This plant is often found in the southern United States, particularly in Texas and Florida. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including land development and transportation infrastructure.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in many disturbed sites across its range.</p>
