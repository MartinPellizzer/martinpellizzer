                <h1>Adonis inermis</h1>
<p>Adonis inermis, commonly known as the naked adonis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, single flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant features a short, upright stem with heart-shaped leaves that are usually hairy. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens.</p>
<p>Adonis inermis is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils, thriving in cool, moist environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis inermis has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, erect, and slightly woody with a grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are bright yellow, with a single row of petals and a prominent central stamen, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to dry conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis inermis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, including Spain, Portugal, and parts of Italy.</p>
<p>It is also found in the Mediterranean Basin, particularly in areas with rocky or limestone soils. This plant thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. It is commonly associated with open grasslands and slopes in these regions.</p>
<p>Adonis inermis is well adapted to the cool, dry climates typical of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis inermis was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a potential environmental weed. The plant spreads through seeds and can colonize disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
