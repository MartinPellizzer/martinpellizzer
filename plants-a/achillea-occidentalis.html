                <h1>Achillea occidentalis</h1>
<p>Achillea occidentalis, commonly known as western yarrow, is a flowering plant native to western North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features basal rosettes of linear, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a popular choice for garden use.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea occidentalis has compound, serrated leaves that are basal and alternate, with a gray-green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a greenish-brown bark, growing in a clumping pattern. Its flowers are flat-topped umbels of white or pale yellow petals, blooming in summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry achene, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and survive in dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea occidentalis is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal regions and inland areas with a Mediterranean climate. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in open woodlands and grasslands. It is well adapted to the dry summers and mild, wet winters typical of its native range.</p>
<p>Achillea occidentalis is an important species in local ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea occidentalis was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in regions such as California and the Pacific Northwest. The plant has spread beyond its original introduction sites due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in various soil types. It is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is also valued for its attractive yellow flowers and medicinal properties.</p>
