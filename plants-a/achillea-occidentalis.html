                <h1>Achillea occidentalis</h1>
<p>Achillea occidentalis, commonly known as western yarrow, is a perennial herb native to western North America.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces flat-topped clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It has a strong, aromatic scent and is known for its medicinal properties historically used by indigenous peoples.</p>
<p>Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea occidentalis has leaves that are lanceolate to oblanceolate in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged in a basal rosette, and varying in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a grey-green color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a greenish-gray bark, growing in a single, unbranched pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea occidentalis is a flowering plant native to western North America, specifically found in the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. This species thrives in arid to semi-arid environments and is typically found at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>It is listed as a species of concern in some regions due to habitat loss and fragmentation, though it remains relatively widespread in its native range.</p>
