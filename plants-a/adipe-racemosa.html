                <h1>Adipe racemosa</h1>
<p>Adipe racemosa, commonly known as the fatwood plant, is a unique species characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often waxy stems.</p>
<p>It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in humid, temperate climates. The plant produces clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>Adipe racemosa is notable for its ability to store water in its thickened stems, making it somewhat drought-tolerant once established.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adipe racemosa has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and green, with a climbing growth pattern that allows it to ascend supports. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adipe racemosa is primarily native to South America, specifically in regions of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant is commonly associated with humid lowland areas and is part of the Rubiaceae family. Its distribution is largely restricted to the Atlantic Forest and surrounding ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some parts of its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adipe racemosa was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks. The plant has been reported in several regions of North America, particularly in the eastern and central United States. Its rapid growth and adaptability have made it a common invasive species in many local ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited compared to other more aggressive invasive plants.</p>
