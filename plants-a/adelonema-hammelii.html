                <h1>Adelonema hammelii</h1>
<p>Adelonema hammelii, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelonema hammelii has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and they grow in a creeping or ascending pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelonema hammelii is primarily native to Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of this country, particularly in the Atlantic lowlands. This plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the rainforests. It is a member of the Meliaceae family, known for its ornamental and ecological significance.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific habitats in Costa Rica, making it a regionally important species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelonema hammelii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions such as Hawaii and the Mariana Islands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas where it thrives in well-drained soils. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and small flowers. However, it has been identified as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
