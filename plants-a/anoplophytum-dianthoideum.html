<p>Anoplophytum dianthoideum, commonly known as the desert carnation, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a succulent, branching stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces showy, violet or pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments.</p>
