                <h1>Achyrocline stenoptera</h1>
<p>Achyrocline stenoptera, commonly known as the silverleaf daisy, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves and daisy-like white flowers with yellow centers. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other composite flowers. It typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The species is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline stenoptera has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with tubular petals and yellow-orange coloration, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline stenoptera is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater and Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical areas of the western Atlantic Ocean. This plant thrives in coastal and lowland habitats, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It is particularly associated with the islands of the Bahamas, Cuba, and Hispaniola.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific geographic areas, making it a regional endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline stenoptera was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species that competes with native plants for resources. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and coastal environments. Its rapid growth can alter local ecosystems and reduce biodiversity.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect native flora.</p>
