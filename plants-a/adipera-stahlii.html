                <h1>Adipera stahlii</h1>
<p>Adipera stahlii, commonly known as the Stahli's orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a distinctive inflorescence that bears several showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within tropical forests. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>Adipera stahlii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated by enthusiasts of rare orchids.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adipera stahlii has small, ovate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a leathery texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, pale brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted for anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adipera stahlii is primarily native to the eastern Himalayas, specifically in regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude areas with cool and moist climates. This plant thrives in mountainous terrains and is often associated with rocky or forested slopes. It is typically found at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adipera stahlii was mainly introduced to the eastern United States, particularly in states like Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is often found in areas with rich, loamy soil and consistent moisture. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to spread into native habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered a non-native species with limited ecological impact in its introduced range.</p>
