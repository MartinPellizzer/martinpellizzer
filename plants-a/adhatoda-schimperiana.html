                <h1>Adhatoda schimperiana</h1>
<p>Adhatoda schimperiana, commonly known as the Indian Trumpet or African Trumpet Plant, is a shrub native to tropical Africa and southern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Adhatoda schimperiana thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda schimperiana has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light brown to grayish bark that peels off in thin layers. Its flowers are trumpet-shaped, with five lobes, and are typically blue to violet in color, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda schimperiana is a climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Although it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited, with fragmented populations primarily found in the western and southern parts of India. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth and along riverbanks, often growing in humid, well-drained soils. This species typically occurs at altitudes between 300 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Adhatoda schimperiana is considered vulnerable, and its conservation status is of concern in many regions.</p>
