                <h1>Adhatoda schimperiana</h1>
<p>Adhatoda schimperiana, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its aromatic, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their antispasmodic and expectorant properties.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda schimperiana has elliptical or ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth upper surface and a slightly hairy underside, measuring approximately 5–10 cm in length and 2–4 cm in width, and displaying a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that peels off in longitudinal strips, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with a distinctive tubular corolla and a blue-violet color, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensively branched, aiding in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda schimperiana is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of southern and eastern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Malawi.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments like forests and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also occasionally found in parts of Southeast Asia, though its primary range remains in Africa.</p>
<p>Adhatoda schimperiana is known for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda schimperiana was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and partial to full sunlight. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique flowering patterns. It has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, Africa, and parts of the Americas.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
