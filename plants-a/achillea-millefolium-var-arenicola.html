<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or sandy environments. Its aromatic foliage and long blooming period make it a valuable addition to xeriscapes and wildflower gardens.</p>
<p>It is also noted for its historical use in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. arenicola has narrow, gray-green leaves that are finely divided into thread-like segments, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
