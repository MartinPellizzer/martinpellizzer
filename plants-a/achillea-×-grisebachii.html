                <h1>Achillea × grisebachii</h1>
<p>Achillea × grisebachii, commonly known as the German yarrow, is a hybrid perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green foliage and flat, composite flower heads that range from white to pinkish in color. Native to Central Europe, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant's name honors the ancient Greek hero Achilles, reflecting its historical use in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × grisebachii has basal leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a grayish-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slightly hairy, and has a grayish-brown color, with a branching growth pattern that becomes more open as the plant matures. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, enabling the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × grisebachii is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, particularly in the Alps and Carpathians.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Europe, the Middle East, and some areas of Russia, where it has been introduced or naturalized. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin and limited natural range, it is considered a rare plant and is listed as endangered in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea × grisebachii is a hybrid perennial plant known for its vibrant, feathery foliage and long-lasting yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a dormant growth cycle, becoming active in spring and blooming throughout summer before going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize it in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune faded flower heads to encourage new growth. It is generally pest and disease resistant, though it may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and attract beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea × grisebachii is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
