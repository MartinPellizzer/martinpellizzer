                <h1>Acalypha scabrosa var. ovata</h1>
<p>Acalypha scabrosa var. ovata, commonly known as the roughleaf glorybower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, rough-textured leaves that are often bright green with a waxy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Acalypha scabrosa var. ovata is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for xeriscaping in suitable environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha scabrosa var. ovata has elliptical to ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside, ranging in size from 5 to 10 cm in length and 2 to 4 cm in width, and displaying a vibrant green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly woody, with a rough, ridged texture and a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age, growing in a bushy pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with greenish-white bracts and stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed schizocarp that splits into three one-seeded units, with seeds dispersed by wind due to their small size and light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to poor soils and allowing the plant to thrive in disturbed environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha scabrosa var. ovata is a variant of the acalypha genus native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of eastern and southern Africa, where it has been introduced in some areas. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and along riverbanks. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha scabrosa var. ovata is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant foliage and unique growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. This fast-growing plant thrives in warm climates and has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season promotes lush growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and encourages bushier development. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like rosemary or marigolds can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>
