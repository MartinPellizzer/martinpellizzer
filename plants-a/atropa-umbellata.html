                    <h1>Atropa umbellata</h1>
<p>Atropa umbellata, commonly known as deadly nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dark green, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, which bloom in late summer. Its berries, which are bright red when ripe, are highly toxic and contain tropane alkaloids.</p>
<p>Despite its toxic properties, it has been historically used in medicine and magic due to its potent chemical composition.</p>
