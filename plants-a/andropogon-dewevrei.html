<p>Andropogon dewevrei, commonly known as the African switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and savannas, thriving in full sun. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and potential for erosion control, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
