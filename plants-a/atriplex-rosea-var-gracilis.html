<p>Atriplex rosea var. gracilis, commonly known as silverleaf chenopody, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, powdery hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. Its succulent leaves and stems store water, making it well adapted to dry environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
