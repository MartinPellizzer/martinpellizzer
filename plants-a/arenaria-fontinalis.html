                    <h1>Arenaria fontinalis</h1>
<p>Arenaria fontinalis, commonly known as the spring sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist, rocky habitats in the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in stream banks and shaded woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
