                    <h1>Acidoton innocuus</h1>
<p>Acidoton innocuus, commonly known as the harmless acid plant, is a unique species characterized by its ability to secrete weak acids from its leaves.</p>
<p>This botanical feature allows it to deter herbivores and compete effectively with neighboring plants. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. The plant has a shallow root system, which helps it absorb nutrients from the soil surface.</p>
<p>Its leaves are typically small and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
