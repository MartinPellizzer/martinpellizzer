                <h1>Acidoton innocuus</h1>
<p>Acidoton innocuus, commonly known as the harmless acid plant, is a unique species characterized by its ability to secrete weak acids from its leaves.</p>
<p>This botanical feature allows it to deter herbivores and compete effectively with neighboring plants. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. The plant has a shallow root system, which helps it absorb nutrients from the soil surface.</p>
<p>Its leaves are typically small and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidoton innocuus has leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size of about 5-7 cm in length and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when dry.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidoton innocuus is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, specifically regions such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found in the undergrowth of primary forests, where it contributes to the biodiversity of the ecosystem. It plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for various small organisms.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its distribution is becoming increasingly fragmented.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidoton innocuus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and moist habitats, often near human settlements.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments where competition from native plants is reduced, allowing it to spread rapidly. This plant is commonly found in roadside ditches, abandoned fields, and along irrigation channels. Its introduction has been linked to intentional planting for ornamental purposes or accidental dispersal through agricultural activities.</p>
<p>Despite its non-native status, it has established itself in several regions, posing a potential threat to local biodiversity.</p>
