<p>Agave zapupe, commonly known as the Zapupe agave, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, spiky leaves that form a rosette shape, typical of many agave species. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that bears white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in the summer months. Its thick, fleshy leaves store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Agave zapupe is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in local cultures.</p>
