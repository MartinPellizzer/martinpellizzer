                <h1>Acronychia esquirolii</h1>
<p>Acronychia esquirolii, commonly known as the Eucalyptus-like tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to northern Australia and is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Acronychia esquirolii is often found in rainforest or wet sclerophyll forest habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia esquirolii has compound leaves that are pinnate, with ovate to elliptical leaflets that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grey to brown in color, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the wet season, and are likely pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody drupe, containing one or two seeds, which are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia esquirolii is primarily native to eastern Australia, specifically Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the wet tropical and subtropical rainforests of these regions. This plant typically grows in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often associated with coastal and lowland rainforest habitats.</p>
<p>Acronychia esquirolii is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia esquirolii was mainly introduced to South East Asia, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The plant thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil and partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique fruit.</p>
<p>However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
