<p>Androsace rotundifolia subsp.</p>
<p>glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It features a dense rosette of rounded, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, typically arranged in clusters at the center of the rosette. Its subspecies designation, *glandulosa*, refers to the presence of glandular structures on its leaves and stems.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes.</p>
