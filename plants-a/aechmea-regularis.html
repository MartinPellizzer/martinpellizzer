<p>Aechmea regularis, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, and they often feature intricate patterns and a slight bluish or reddish tinge. The plant produces a flowering spike that can reach several feet in height, bearing showy, spathiflorous flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow.</p>
<p>After flowering, it produces offsets that can be propagated to create new plants.</p>
