                <h1>Acronema chienii</h1>
<p>Acronema chienii, commonly known as the Chinese acronema, is a flowering plant species native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in umbels. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a mild, aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Acronema chienii is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronema chienii has small, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, while the underside is lighter in color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that remains thin throughout the plant's growth. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema chienii is primarily native to China South-Central and Tibet.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in mountainous regions within these areas. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Acronema chienii is often associated with forested or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is relatively limited, reflecting its specific ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema chienii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the late 20th century as an invasive species in Washington state. The plant spreads primarily through seed dispersal by wind and water. It has since been reported in several counties across Oregon and British Columbia.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
