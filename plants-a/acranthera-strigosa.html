                <h1>Acranthera strigosa</h1>
<p>Acranthera strigosa, commonly known as the hairy acranthera, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, narrow leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Acranthera strigosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera strigosa has leaves that are narrow, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and grows upright, with a grayish-green bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, clustered in terminal inflorescences, and bloom during the summer months, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera strigosa is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this island, which is part of the Malay Archipelago. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments within the understorey of the forest. It is known for its small, white flowers and is often associated with rocky or clay soils.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera strigosa was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape Province.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and on sandy soils. This plant is often associated with fynbos vegetation types. It has been introduced for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential weed in some regions where it can spread rapidly.</p>
