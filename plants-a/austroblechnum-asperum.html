<p>Austroblechnum asperum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with a rough texture. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Austroblechnum asperum is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
