<p>Arachnorchis stricta, commonly known as the slender spider-orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks and branches, relying on its host for physical support rather than soil. The plant produces striking, spider-like flowers in shades of yellow and green, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Arachnorchis stricta is a rare and delicate species, often found in subtropical rainforests.</p>
