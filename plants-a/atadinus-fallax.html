                    <h1>Atadinus fallax</h1>
<p>Atadinus fallax, commonly known as the blackberry lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a dark, almost black, upper surface with a lighter, sometimes grayish, lower surface. The thallus is composed of a complex interweaving of fungal hyphae and algal cells, which together form a symbiotic relationship. It is often found on bark, stones, or soil in temperate forests.</p>
<p>This lichen is notable for its ability to tolerate pollution and is used as an indicator of air quality in ecological studies.</p>
