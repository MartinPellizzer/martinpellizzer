<p>Achillea buiana, commonly known as the Balkan yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. It has a compact growth habit and is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea buiana has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a silvery-gray underside and a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and slightly woody, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green composite blooms arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a small achene enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea buiana is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans, specifically found in parts of southern and central Europe.</p>
