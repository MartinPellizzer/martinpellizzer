                    <h1>Arenaria gracilis</h1>
<p>Arenaria gracilis, commonly known as slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Arenaria gracilis plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
