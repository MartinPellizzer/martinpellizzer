                    <h1>Andromeda revoluta var. emarginata</h1>
<p>Andromeda revoluta var. emarginata, commonly known as the fragrant wintergreen, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that gives it a glossy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its aromatic foliage releases a sharp, peppery scent when crushed, a characteristic shared with other members of the Ericaceae family.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly noted for its ornamental value and adaptability to moist, acidic soils.</p>
