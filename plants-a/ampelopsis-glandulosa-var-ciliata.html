<p>Ampelopsis glandulosa var. ciliata, commonly known as the curlyleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with a distinctive wavy or curled margin, and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its vigorous growth makes it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
