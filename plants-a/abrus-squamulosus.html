<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by distinctive, elongated pods containing flat, seed-bearing structures. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it is often found growing in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The plant has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes, though caution is advised due to the presence of toxic compounds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abrus squamulosus has alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are trifoliate, with ovate leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a climbing vine. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in axillary racemes, blooming from July to September, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a flat, indehiscent pod that turns red when mature, containing kidney-shaped seeds with a distinctive red aril, and the seeds are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, aiding in the plant's climbing habit and nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrus squamulosus is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Uganda, and Kenya.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of southern Asia, including India and Sri Lanka, likely due to human introduction. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth, often growing along trees or shrubs. It typically occurs at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its habitat is threatened by deforestation and land-use changes, leading to concerns about its long-term conservation status.</p>
