                        <h1>Abrus squamulosus</h1>
<p>Abrus squamulosus, commonly known as the velvet bean or horse bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, spiny stems and heart-shaped, compound leaves. The plant produces striking, crimson-red seed pods that contain flat, kidney-shaped seeds with a distinctive black spot. These seeds are toxic due to the presence of abrin, a potent lectin.</p>
<p>It is often grown as an ornamental plant but is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of protein in some regions.</p>
