                <h1>Acianthera raduliglossa</h1>
<p>Acianthera raduliglossa, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial herb with a short, creeping rhizome and produces clusters of fragrant, violet-colored flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts for its unique appearance and scent.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera raduliglossa has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in inflorescences, displaying a striking combination of white and violet hues, blooming during the late spring to early summer months, and are pollinated primarily by nocturnal moths. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera raduliglossa is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the states of São Paulo, Paraná, and Santa Catarina. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the dense understory of tropical rainforests. The plant thrives in areas with high biodiversity and is often associated with rocky or clayey soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to protect its natural range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera raduliglossa was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental plant due to its striking floral display.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several tropical and subtropical areas, including parts of South America, Southeast Asia, and the Caribbean. The plant's introduction is largely attributed to horticultural trade and intentional cultivation by gardeners and botanists. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in diverse conditions have contributed to its spread in non-native habitats.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains under study, as it may pose a risk to local flora in certain environments.</p>
