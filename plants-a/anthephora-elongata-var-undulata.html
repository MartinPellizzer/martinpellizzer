                    <h1>Anthephora elongata var. undulata</h1>
<p>Anthephora elongata var. undulata, commonly known as the wavy-stemmed anthephora, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, undulating stems that often trail along the ground, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
