<p>Arthrophyllum sablanense, commonly known as the Sablan fern, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the limestone caves of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that grow in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with high levels of calcium from the limestone substrate. Its unique habitat makes it highly sensitive to environmental changes, contributing to its status as a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this rare botanical treasure.</p>
