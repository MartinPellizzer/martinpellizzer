                <h1>Achroanthes unifolia</h1>
<p>Achroanthes unifolia, commonly known as the singleleaf achroanthes, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slight hairy texture.</p>
<p>Achroanthes unifolia is typically found in moist, sandy soils in open woodlands and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achroanthes unifolia has simple, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a narrow, grass-like shape.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achroanthes unifolia is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. This plant thrives in desert scrub and grassland habitats, often growing in rocky or sandy environments. It is adapted to tolerate high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes states such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, as well as parts of Baja California.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achroanthes unifolia was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal or inland dune environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate. This plant is typically introduced to disturbed sites such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. Its ability to grow in harsh conditions makes it a common invader in native plant communities.</p>
<p>It is often spread by wind or through human activities, leading to its establishment in new habitats.</p>
