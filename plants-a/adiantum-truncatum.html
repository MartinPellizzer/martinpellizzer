                <h1>Adiantum truncatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum truncatum, commonly known as the fragrant maidenhair fern, is a delicate and ornamental fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and slightly curled at the tips. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its unique, fern-like appearance makes it a popular choice for shady garden beds and indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Adiantum truncatum is also noted for its subtle, sweet fragrance when the fronds are brushed.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum truncatum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with a delicate, lace-like appearance and a truncate (notched) tip.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically bright green, with a slender, upright arrangement along the stem. The stem is slender and creeping, with a smooth, light green to reddish-brown bark, and it grows horizontally along the ground.</p>
<p>Adiantum truncatum produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a slender, two-lobed capsule that splits open to release minute, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum truncatum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant thrives in cool, moist climates and is often associated with rocky or wooded areas. It is also present in parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends across temperate and subtropical regions where it can grow as an epiphyte or terrestrial plant.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum truncatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and stream sides. This fern has become naturalized in several states, including Oregon and Washington. It is often mistaken for native species due to its similar appearance.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
