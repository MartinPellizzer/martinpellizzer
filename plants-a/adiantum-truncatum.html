<p>Adiantum truncatum, commonly known as the fragrant maidenhair fern, is a delicate and ornamental fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and slightly curled at the tips. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its unique, fern-like appearance makes it a popular choice for shady garden beds and indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Adiantum truncatum is also noted for its subtle, sweet fragrance when the fronds are brushed.</p>
