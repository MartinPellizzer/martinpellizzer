<p>Acrosorus triangularis, commonly known as the triangular fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive triangular-shaped fronds, which are typically divided into smaller, lanceolate segments. The plant is native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the upper fronds dying back each year, allowing new growth from the base.</p>
