                <h1>Acrosorus triangularis</h1>
<p>Acrosorus triangularis, commonly known as the triangular fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive triangular-shaped fronds, which are typically divided into smaller, lanceolate segments. The plant is native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the upper fronds dying back each year, allowing new growth from the base.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrosorus triangularis has leaves that are triangular in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with three petals, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. Its fruit is a dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrosorus triangularis is primarily native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. This plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within lowland and montane rainforests. It thrives in areas with high rainfall and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with the Amazon Basin and surrounding forested regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrosorus triangularis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, making it suitable for cultivation in gardens and natural habitats. The plant is often found in regions with high rainfall and partial to full shade, such as forest understories or shaded rock gardens. Its introduction has been noted in several countries where it has been cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited due to specific environmental requirements and lack of widespread naturalization.</p>
