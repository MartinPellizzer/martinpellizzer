                <h1>Acourtia matudae</h1>
<p>Acourtia matudae, commonly known as Matud's acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in the spring, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits.</p>
<p>Acourtia matudae is a relatively rare species, and its conservation status is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia matudae has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in a rough, hairy texture, and has a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in dry, rocky environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia matudae is primarily native to Mexico Central.</p>
<p>It is found in the central regions of Mexico, including parts of the states such as Hidalgo, Puebla, and Tlaxcala. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of the region. It is often found in scrublands and along limestone outcrops.</p>
<p>Acourtia matudae is a rare and endemic species, with a limited geographic range within Mexico Central.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia matudae was mainly introduced to the coastal areas of California and southern Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. This plant thrives in maritime climates with mild temperatures and moderate precipitation. It is often seen growing in association with other coastal vegetation such as beach grasses and dune plants.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common sight in many coastal ecosystems along the Pacific Northwest.</p>
