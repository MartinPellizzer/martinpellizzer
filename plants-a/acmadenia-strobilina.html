<p>Acmadenia strobilina, commonly known as the Christmas bush, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom during the winter months, making it a notable plant in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmadenia strobilina has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a spreading, shrub-like form. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmadenia strobilina is a flowering plant native to the island of New Guinea, specifically found in the eastern part of the country.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations within the highlands of Papua, Indonesia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and mountainous regions. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,200 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, Acmadenia strobilina is considered a vulnerable species and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmadenia strobilina is a hardy, evergreen shrub native to Australia, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
