<p>Aspidium minimum, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with closely spaced, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, papery indusium.</p>
<p>Aspidium minimum is characterized by its delicate, fern-like appearance and is often found in temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
