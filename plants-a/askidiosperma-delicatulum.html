<p>Askidiosperma delicatulum, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for musical instruments and furniture. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species, leading to conservation efforts to protect its population.</p>
