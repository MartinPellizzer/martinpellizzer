                <h1>Acmella brasiliensis</h1>
<p>Acmella brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian triggerplant, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking, yellow-orange flowers that resemble small, spurred petals. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella brasiliensis has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 2-4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, semi-woody, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, yellow, and borne in clusters, with five petals and a prominent central stamen, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, sandy soils.</p>
