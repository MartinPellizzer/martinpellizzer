                <h1>Acmella brasiliensis</h1>
<p>Acmella brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian button plant, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, round, yellowish flowers that resemble buttons. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats and is often found in marshy areas. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>Acmella brasiliensis is also known for its ornamental value and is cultivated for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella brasiliensis has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a slightly wavy margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a pale green bark that becomes rough as the plant matures. Its flowers are compact, yellowish-white in color, with a distinctive central tubular structure and five petal-like lobes, blooming from late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds through wind and animal contact.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils by forming symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella brasiliensis is primarily native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans across eastern and southeastern Brazil. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>Acmella brasiliensis is also found in parts of Paraguay and Argentina.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella brasiliensis was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in regions with seasonal rainfall patterns. This plant is often associated with human-modified landscapes such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and abandoned clearings. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a potential invasive species in certain environments.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and traditional medicinal uses in some cultures.</p>
