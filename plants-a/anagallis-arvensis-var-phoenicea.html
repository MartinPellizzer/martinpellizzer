<p>Anagallis arvensis var. phoenicea, commonly known as the red-flowered mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with distinctive, tubular red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are often clustered at the base, and it thrives in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. It is characterized by its bright, showy blooms that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This variety is often confused with other Anagallis species due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its vivid red coloration.</p>
