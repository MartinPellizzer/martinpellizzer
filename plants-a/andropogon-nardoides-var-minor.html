                    <h1>Andropogon nardoides var. minor</h1>
<p>Andropogon nardoides var. minor, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
<p>It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability to waterlogged conditions.</p>
