                    <h1>Amyema pilosa</h1>
<p>Amyema pilosa, commonly known as the hairy lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits unique botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a cyanobacterium or green alga. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the fungal partner. Amyema pilosa is typically found growing on tree bark or rock surfaces in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its hairy appearance is due to the presence of fine, filamentous structures on its surface.</p>
