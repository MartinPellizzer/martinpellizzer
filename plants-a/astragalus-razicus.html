                    <h1>Astragalus razicus</h1>
<p>Astragalus razicus, commonly known as the coastal milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion due to its deep root system.</p>
<p>Astragalus razicus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in coastal ecosystems.</p>
