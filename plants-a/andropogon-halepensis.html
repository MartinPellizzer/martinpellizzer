<p>Andropogon halepensis, commonly known as Spanish needle or goatherb, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white, feathery flowers that are wind-pollinated and often appear in clusters. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to various soil types.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
