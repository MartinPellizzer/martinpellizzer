<p>Androsace caduca, commonly known as the summer snowflake, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers in early summer, which bloom in clusters at the tips of its stems. Its leaves are typically succulent and can be either basal or stem-borne, depending on the growth conditions.</p>
<p>Androsace caduca is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cool, moist environments.</p>
