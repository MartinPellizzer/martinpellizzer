<p>Aegilops ovata var. echinus, commonly known as the echinata wild oat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive spiny bracts and awns, which give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a loose panicle, with the upper lemmas bearing short, stiff hairs.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
