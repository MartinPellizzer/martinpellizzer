                <h1>Acourtia tenoriensis</h1>
<p>Acourtia tenoriensis, commonly known as the Tenoriensis acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and coastal climates. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in the spring, and it is often found in coastal scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia tenoriensis has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a rough, light green bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the arid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia tenoriensis is primarily native to Mexico Central and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in rocky soils and is often associated with limestone formations. The species is adapted to the harsh climate conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia tenoriensis was mainly introduced to coastal areas of California, particularly in the northern regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the coastline, where it thrives in the mild, temperate climate. This plant is often associated with disturbed sites such as dunes and tidal zones. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas.</p>
