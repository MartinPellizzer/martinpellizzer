<p>Aloe somaliensis, commonly known as the Somali aloe, is a succulent plant native to the dry regions of Somalia and neighboring areas.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow to orange flowers, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that has been used for its soothing and healing properties.</p>
<p>Aloe somaliensis is well adapted to harsh climates and requires minimal water to thrive.</p>
