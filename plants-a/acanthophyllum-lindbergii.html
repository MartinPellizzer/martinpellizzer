<p>Acanthophyllum lindbergii, commonly known as the Lindberg's thornbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically small and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acanthophyllum lindbergii is well adapted to sandy soils and extreme temperature fluctuations, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
