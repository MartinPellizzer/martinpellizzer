<p>Asplenium laserpitiifolium, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, shaded environments, often on cliffs or in crevices, where it forms dense, mat-like colonies. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters long, with a pale green to grayish hue. It reproduces through spores, which are released from the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium laserpitiifolium is well adapted to arid conditions and is often found in association with limestone or other calcareous substrates.</p>
