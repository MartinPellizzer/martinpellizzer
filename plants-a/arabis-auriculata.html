The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and rockeries.</p>
