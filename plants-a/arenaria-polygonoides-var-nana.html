                    <h1>Arenaria polygonoides var. nana</h1>
<p>Arenaria polygonoides var. nana, commonly known as dwarf sandpink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky or barren landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cold climates.</p>
