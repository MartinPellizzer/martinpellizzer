                <h1>Adenostachya parvifolia</h1>
<p>Adenostachya parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved grassvetch, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Adenostachya parvifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostachya parvifolia has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostachya parvifolia is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with Mediterranean climates, including parts of California, Arizona, and Baja California. This plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, chaparral, and rocky slopes. It is well adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions where it has evolved to survive in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostachya parvifolia was mainly introduced to specific regions in the western United States, particularly in California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its delicate, feathery foliage. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some areas where it may compete with native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is considered an invasive species in certain regions, requiring management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
