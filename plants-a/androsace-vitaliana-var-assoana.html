<p>Androsace vitaliana var. assoana, commonly known as the alpine snowbell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features a dense mat of hairy, dark green leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine habitats.</p>
