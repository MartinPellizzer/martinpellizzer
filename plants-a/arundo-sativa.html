                    <h1>Arundo sativa</h1>
<p>Arundo sativa, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features hollow, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 6 meters in height, and its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are wind-pollinated, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found near water bodies such as rivers and marshes.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it is both an important ecological plant and a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
