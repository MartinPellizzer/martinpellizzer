                <h1>Achyrospermum parviflorum</h1>
<p>Achyrospermum parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flower false dandelion, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 30â€“60 cm and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish to pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the dry season. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a common sight in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum parviflorum has simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with fine hairs, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark, growing upright with some branching. Its small, clustered flowers are typically pink to purple, with five petals and a prominent yellow center, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum parviflorum is primarily native to DR Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan-South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in areas with warm climates and is often associated with open woodland or grassland habitats. The species is well adapted to the environmental conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum parviflorum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, where it has become a common weed in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is particularly prevalent in Hawaii, where it has spread through both natural and human-assisted means. The plant thrives in sunny, open habitats such as roadsides, vacant lots, and forest edges. Its rapid growth and ability to reproduce prolifically have made it a challenge for native plant restoration efforts.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive yellow flowers.</p>
