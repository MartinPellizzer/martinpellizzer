<p>Arthrocnemum indicum subsp.</p>
<p>glaucum, commonly known as the saltbush or coastal saltbush, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and arid environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in coastal and desert regions.</p>
<p>The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit with branching stems that help reduce water loss through transpiration. Its small, greenish-white flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is an important component of coastal dune ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various organisms.</p>
