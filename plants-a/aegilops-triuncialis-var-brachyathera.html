                    <h1>Aegilops triuncialis var. brachyathera</h1>
<p>Aegilops triuncialis var. brachyathera, commonly known as the short awn wild rye, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with short, stiff awns, which give it its common name. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for forage and its genetic relationship to wheat.</p>
