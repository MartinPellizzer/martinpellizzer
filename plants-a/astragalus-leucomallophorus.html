                    <h1>Astragalus leucomallophorus</h1>
<p>Astragalus leucomallophorus, commonly known as the white-margined milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and ecological stability in its native habitat.</p>
