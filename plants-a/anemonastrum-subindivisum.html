<p>Anemonastrum subindivisum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Anemonastrum subindivisum is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with minimal rainfall.</p>
