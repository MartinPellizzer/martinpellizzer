<p>Athanasia pachycephala subsp.</p>
<p>eriopoda, commonly known as the woolly-headed aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with bright yellow flowers, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for ornamental gardening in dry climates.</p>
