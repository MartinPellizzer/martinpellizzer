<p>Astragalus cartilagineus subsp.</p>
<p>honigbergeri, commonly known as the Honigberger's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, gray-green leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in stabilizing desert soils and its potential medicinal properties.</p>
