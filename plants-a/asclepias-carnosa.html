                    <h1>Asclepias carnosa</h1>
<p>Asclepias carnosa, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces follicles that contain seeds with silky filaments, aiding in wind dispersal. Asclepias carnosa is a critical host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, supporting their life cycle.</p>
<p>Its latex contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but beneficial for certain pollinators.</p>
