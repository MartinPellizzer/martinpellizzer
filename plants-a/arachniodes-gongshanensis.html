                    <h1>Arachniodes gongshanensis</h1>
<p>Arachniodes gongshanensis, commonly known as the Gongshan spider fern, is a rare evergreen fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lacy fronds that resemble spider webs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
