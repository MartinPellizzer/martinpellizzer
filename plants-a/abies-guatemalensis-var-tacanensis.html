                    <h1>Abies guatemalensis var. tacanensis</h1>
<p>Abies guatemalensis var. tacanensis, commonly known as the Tacan√° fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to high-altitude regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals. The tree produces cones that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long, containing winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils, often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
