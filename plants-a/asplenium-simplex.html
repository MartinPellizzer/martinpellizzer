<p>Asplenium simplex, commonly known as the common harts-tongue fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Asplenium simplex is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
