<p>Artemisia baldaccii, commonly known as the Baldaccii wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its aromatic compounds, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported antiseptic and digestive properties.</p>
