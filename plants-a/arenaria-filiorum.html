<p>Arenaria filiorum, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, usually blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Arenaria filiorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens.</p>
