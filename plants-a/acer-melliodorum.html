                <h1>Acer melliodorum</h1>
<p>Acer melliodorum, commonly known as the sweet gum tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and purple in the fall. The tree produces small, spherical fruits that contain spiky seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>The sweet gum tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer melliodorum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small to medium-sized tree. The flowers are small, clustered in corymbs, with yellowish-green petals and a sweet scent, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer melliodorum is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, including the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and overharvesting. It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. This species is usually found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and threats to its habitat, Acer melliodorum is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer melliodorum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and unique maple-like foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves rapid growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigolds can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer melliodorum is a valuable tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, fragrant flowers. Its dense canopy acts as a companion plant, supporting biodiversity in mixed forest ecosystems. The tree also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by improving air quality and offering habitat for a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer melliodorum is a tree known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its sap can be tapped for minor medicinal purposes. It plays a role in industrial and economic contexts by supporting biodiversity and providing habitat for various species. Culturally, it is sometimes symbolized in local traditions and landscapes.</p>
<p>Overall, its primary significance lies in its ecological and aesthetic contributions rather than direct human use.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer melliodorum has several popular cultivars, including 'Crimson King' and 'Autumn Flame', which are prized for their vibrant fall colors and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>Hybrid varieties have been developed to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and disease resistance, making them more adaptable to different climates. These hybrids often combine the ornamental qualities of Acer melliodorum with the resilience of other maple species. The plant holds significant horticultural importance due to its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in urban environments.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids are widely used in landscaping and garden design across temperate regions.</p>
