<p>Acer melliodorum, commonly known as the sweet gum tree, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and its distinctive, star-shaped leaves that turn vibrant colors in the fall. The tree produces small, spherical fruit clusters that contain spiny seeds. Its flowers are inconspicuous, but the tree is notable for its fragrant, resinous sap.</p>
<p>The sweet gum tree is often planted for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer melliodorum has palmately compound leaves that are typically 5â€“9 lobed, with a broad, ovate shape, alternate arrangement, and a size ranging from 5 to 12 inches in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small to medium-sized tree with a rounded crown. The flowers are small, yellow-green, and clustered in catkins, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer melliodorum is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe, specifically in parts of the Carpathian Mountains and the Balkans.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas such as Romania, Bulgaria, and Serbia, where it thrives in temperate climates. This plant prefers well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas, particularly in mixed deciduous and coniferous woodlands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 800 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acer melliodorum is considered to be of conservation concern, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer melliodorum is a deciduous tree known for its striking yellow flowers and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of this tree includes a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-tolerant shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
