                <h1>Adenoropium integerrimum</h1>
<p>Adenoropium integerrimum, commonly known as the rough-leaved daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, rough-textured leaves and produces clusters of small, white, daisy-like flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Adenoropium integerrimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenoropium integerrimum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that develops vertical fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with pale greenish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoropium integerrimum is primarily native to the eastern and southeastern United States, including states such as Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland edges, stream banks, and other disturbed sites. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with open habitats in the Coastal Plain and Piedmont regions. It is known for its distinctive, showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Adenoropium integerrimum is an important component of the native flora in these regions and is often found in conservation and restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoropium integerrimum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid spread has led to increased management efforts to control its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
