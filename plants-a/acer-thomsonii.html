                    <h1>Acer thomsonii</h1>
<p>Acer thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in subalpine and alpine zones.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas.</p>
