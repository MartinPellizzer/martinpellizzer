                        <h1>Acacia semperflorens</h1>
<p>Acacia semperflorens, commonly known as the everblooming acacia, is a shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that bloom continuously throughout the year. The plant produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal and Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and drought tolerance contribute to its widespread use in gardens and landscaping.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia semperflorens is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often seen along the edges of fynbos vegetation. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, with dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Acacia semperflorens is also occasionally found in nearby islands such as St. Helena and阿森松岛.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia semperflorens was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and on rocky outcrops, thriving in sandy or well-drained soils. The plant is known for its fast growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites, making it a common weed in agricultural and urban areas. It is also used in horticulture for its ornamental value, particularly its yellow flowers.</p>
<p>However, its rapid spread has raised concerns about its impact on native vegetation in some ecosystems.</p>
