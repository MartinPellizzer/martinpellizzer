                <h1>Adiantum boreale</h1>
<p>Adiantum boreale, commonly known as the northern maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a small, kidney-shaped indusium.</p>
<p>Adiantum boreale is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum boreale has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lacey appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically triangular in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 10 to 30 centimeters in length. They are usually a bright green color, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant has a slender, erect stem that is smooth and slightly hairy, growing in a clumping pattern.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are wind-pollinated, and develops spore-bearing structures rather than true fruits and seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum boreale is primarily native to northern regions of North America, including Canada and the northern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, cool habitats such as forest floors, stream banks, and rocky areas. This fern thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with boreal and subarctic environments. Its distribution extends into parts of Europe and Asia, where similar ecological conditions exist.</p>
<p>Adiantum boreale is well adapted to shaded, humid environments and is an important component of the flora in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum boreale was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the northern United States and southern Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. This fern is often cultivated in gardens due to its ornamental value and adaptability. It has been reported in several states including New York, Michigan, and Washington.</p>
<p>Its introduction is believed to be through horticultural trade and accidental spread.</p>
