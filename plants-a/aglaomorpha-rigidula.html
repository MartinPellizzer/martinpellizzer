                    <h1>Aglaomorpha rigidula</h1>
<p>Aglaomorpha rigidula, commonly known as the rigid ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with elongated, pale green leaves and delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
