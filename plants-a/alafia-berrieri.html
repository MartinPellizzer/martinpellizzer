                    <h1>Alafia berrieri</h1>
<p>Alafia berrieri, commonly known as the St. Croix cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and large, feather-like leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it produces cones for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from development and environmental changes, Alafia berrieri is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
