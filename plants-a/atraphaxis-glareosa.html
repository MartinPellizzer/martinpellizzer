                    <h1>Atraphaxis glareosa</h1>
<p>Atraphaxis glareosa, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy and rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Atraphaxis glareosa is well adapted to harsh desert environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
