<p>Aragoa occidentalis, commonly known as the western aragoa, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapting to the arid conditions of its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aragoa occidentalis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
