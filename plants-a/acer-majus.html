                    <h1>Acer majus</h1>
<p>Acer majus, commonly known as the large maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, developing fissures with age.</p>
<p>Acer majus typically grows to a height of 20â€“30 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils in full sun.</p>
