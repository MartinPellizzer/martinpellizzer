                <h1>Acer majus</h1>
<p>Acer majus, commonly known as the large maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, developing fissures with age.</p>
<p>Acer majus typically grows to a height of 20â€“30 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils in full sun.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer majus has leaves that are broad ovate, with a pointed tip and serrated edges, arranged alternately along the stem, and they range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, displaying vibrant green during the growing season and turning red or yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow catkins that appear in early spring, with male and female flowers on separate trees, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule that matures in late summer, dispersing by wind as the wings catch air currents.</p>
<p>The roots are taproots with lateral branches, anchoring the plant and absorbing water and nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer majus is a species of maple native to the eastern United States, primarily found in the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to specific regions in Virginia and West Virginia. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas, often growing in shaded or partially shaded environments. It typically occurs at altitudes between 600 and 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Acer majus is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer majus is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant foliage and elegant form.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring a period of cold stratification to break dormancy. The growth cycle of Acer majus includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by active growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and remove diseased branches. It is relatively resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like lavender or marigold can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer majus is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers and produces edible fruits that sustain birds and other animals. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a wide range of life forms. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land and protecting waterways.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer majus contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality, offering significant ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer majus is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and flowers have been historically used in traditional herbal remedies. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to biodiversity and supports wildlife, making it valuable for conservation efforts. Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and renewal, often featured in art and literature.</p>
<p>Its role in landscaping and urban environments also highlights its aesthetic and environmental benefits.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer majus has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Aureum' with its golden leaves and 'Variegatum' known for its variegated foliage.</p>
<p>Hybrids of Acer majus are often created to enhance traits such as disease resistance, growth habit, and color variation. These cultivars and hybrids are widely used in horticulture for landscaping and garden design. They contribute significantly to the diversity of maple trees in cultivated settings.</p>
<p>Their aesthetic appeal makes them a favorite among gardeners and landscape designers.</p>
