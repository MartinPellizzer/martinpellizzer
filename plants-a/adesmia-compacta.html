                <h1>Adesmia compacta</h1>
<p>Adesmia compacta, commonly known as the compact burr legume, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a small, shrub-like species characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in compact inflorescences. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several small, rounded seeds.</p>
<p>Adesmia compacta is often found in dry, disturbed habitats and is adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia compacta has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a slightly rough texture and a reddish-brown color, growing in a compact, shrub-like form. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia compacta is primarily native to South America, specifically ranging from Argentina to northern Chile.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the Andean foothills and surrounding desert areas. This plant thrives in rocky soils and is often associated with shrublands and grasslands. It is well adapted to the harsh climate conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Adesmia compacta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia compacta was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high sunlight exposure and well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along trails. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
