                <h1>Acmella radicans</h1>
<p>Acmella radicans, commonly known as the spreading jewelweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, colorful, bead-like flowers that range from yellow to red. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Acmella radicans is also used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella radicans has leaves that are heart-shaped, arranged alternately along the stems, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size, typically around 2-4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody with a smooth, light brown bark, and grows in a trailing or climbing pattern. Its flowers are small, yellow with a distinctive red spot at the base, arranged in clusters, and bloom from late spring to early autumn, primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in the plant's ability to spread along the ground.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella radicans is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and parts of the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other tropical and subtropical areas around the world, including parts of Central America and the Caribbean. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as understorey vegetation in humid forests. This species typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, it is not considered threatened, but its introduction to new areas may pose ecological risks in non-native habitats.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmella radicans is a vigorous, trailing plant known for its bright yellow flowers and rapid growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most effective method for quick results. This plant has a fast growth cycle, often flowering within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to encourage bushiness are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or mealybugs, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
