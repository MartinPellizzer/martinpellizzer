<p>Acacia endlicheri, commonly known as the desert wattle, is a shrub native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and phyllodes, which are flattened leaf-like structures adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in winter, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It is well-suited to harsh environments due to its deep root system and ability to fix nitrogen.</p>
<p>Acacia endlicheri plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
