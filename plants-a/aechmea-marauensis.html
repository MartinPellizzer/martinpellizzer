                    <h1>Aechmea marauensis</h1>
<p>Aechmea marauensis, commonly known as the Marau pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the Amazon rainforest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flower spikes that emerge from the center of the rosette. Its leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, adapted to retain moisture in the humid environment.</p>
<p>Aechmea marauensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat.</p>
