                <h1>Aechmea marauensis</h1>
<p>Aechmea marauensis, commonly known as the Marau pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the Amazon rainforest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flower spikes that emerge from the center of the rosette. Its leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, adapted to retain moisture in the humid environment.</p>
<p>Aechmea marauensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea marauensis has leaves that are strap-shaped, arranged in a rosette, and typically measure 30â€“50 cm in length, with a dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, but its basal rosette forms a tight cluster, and the leaves are tightly packed, creating a cup-like structure. The flowers are clustered in a spike, with bright orange or red bracts that enclose the inflorescence, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and beetles. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the air and soil, supporting the plant's epiphytic growth habit.</p>
