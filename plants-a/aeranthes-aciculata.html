<p>Aeranthes aciculata, commonly known as the needleleaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil and Peru.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid with slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky slopes. Its root system is adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soils, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for survival.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its unique morphology and is often found in association with other epiphytic orchids in its habitat.</p>
