                    <h1>Achyrastrum</h1>
<p>Achyrastrum, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are low-growing, mat-forming grasses that are well adapted to drought conditions. They have narrow, bluish-green leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Achyrastrum species are often used in landscaping and restoration projects due to their drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
