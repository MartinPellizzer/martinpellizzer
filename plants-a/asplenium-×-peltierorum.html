                    <h1>Asplenium × peltierorum</h1>
<p>Asplenium × peltierorum, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and the presence of small, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>As a hybrid, it exhibits a combination of traits from both parent species, making it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
