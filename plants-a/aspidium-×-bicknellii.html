<p>Aspidium × bicknellii, commonly known as the Bicknell's water fern, is a hybrid fern species that exhibits characteristics of its parent species, Aspidium and possibly others.</p>
<p>It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a creeping rhizome and pinnate leaves that are often divided into smaller segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>This hybrid is of interest to botanists due to its unique genetic makeup and ecological adaptability.</p>
