                    <h1>Agropyron repens var. barbatum</h1>
<p>Agropyron repens var. barbatum, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, mat-forming structure, which helps it thrive in disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with distinctive hairy margins, giving it its common name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
