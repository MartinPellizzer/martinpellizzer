                <h1>Adinandra glischroloma</h1>
<p>Adinandra glischroloma, commonly known as the red-flowered adinandra, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of bright red flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra glischroloma has simple, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra glischroloma is primarily native to China Southeast.</p>
<p>This species is found in the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in provinces such as Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in secondary forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within this geographic region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra glischroloma was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland forests, where it thrives in partial to full shade. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering characteristics. It has been introduced to several Pacific Island nations, including Hawaii and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by its specific environmental requirements and is not considered invasive in most regions.</p>
