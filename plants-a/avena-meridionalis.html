<p>Avena meridionalis, commonly known as the southern oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in a protective hull, and the plant is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Avena meridionalis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
