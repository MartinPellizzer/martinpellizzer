                    <h1>Althaea vulgaris</h1>
<p>Althaea vulgaris, commonly known as the common marshmallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its fuzzy, cylindrical stems are covered in soft, velvety hairs, which contribute to its tactile appeal.</p>
<p>Althaea vulgaris has been historically used in traditional medicine for its mucilage-rich roots, which are known for their soothing properties.</p>
