                <h1>Acronia drewii</h1>
<p>Acronia drewii, commonly known as the desert broom.</p>
<p>It is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant has small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Acronia drewii is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia drewii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, and a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plant's growth. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia drewii is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, including dunes and sandy soils. This species thrives in wetland environments such as marshes and tidal flats. It is adapted to saltwater exposure and can tolerate periodic flooding.</p>
<p>Acronia drewii is an important component of the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia drewii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal dune environments where it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats and can spread rapidly in areas with low vegetation cover. Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native flora.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to manage its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
