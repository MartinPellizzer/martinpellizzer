                    <h1>Anomocarpus</h1>
<p>Anomocarpus, commonly known as the "false dandelion," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and their showy, dandelion-like flowers that are often yellow or orange in color. Anomocarpus species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in dry, sandy soils. They produce small, dry fruits called cypsela, which are dispersed by wind, similar to dandelions.</p>
<p>Some species are used in traditional medicine, while others are considered invasive in certain regions.</p>
