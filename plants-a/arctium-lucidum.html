<p>Arctium lucidum, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple flowers that develop into burrs with hooked bracts, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Its root system is fibrous and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Arctium lucidum thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open habitats.</p>
