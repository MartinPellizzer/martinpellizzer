                    <h1>Agave ensiformis</h1>
<p>Agave ensiformis, commonly known as the sword agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a thick layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that can reach up to 10 feet in height, bearing clusters of white or yellow flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun with well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Agave ensiformis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and striking appearance.</p>
