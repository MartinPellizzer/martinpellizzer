                        <h1>Acalypha subcinerea</h1>
<p>Acalypha subcinerea, commonly known as silverleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish-white, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Acalypha subcinerea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha subcinerea is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can be found in both natural and cultivated environments across its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha subcinerea was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced through human activity, such as accidental transport in soil or as a contaminant in agricultural products. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland habitats, often along roadsides and in urban environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily, it poses a significant threat to local ecosystems.</p>
