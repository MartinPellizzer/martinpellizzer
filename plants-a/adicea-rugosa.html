                <h1>Adicea rugosa</h1>
<p>Adicea rugosa, commonly known as the rough adicea, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap and showy flowers. The plant is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which give it its common name. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with five petals and a distinctive corona.</p>
<p>Adicea rugosa is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea rugosa has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a rough, hairy surface and a dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, moderately branched, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in loose inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
