<p>Acrostichum melanopus, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in rows on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The black fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
