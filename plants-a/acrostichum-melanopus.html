                <h1>Acrostichum melanopus</h1>
<p>Acrostichum melanopus, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in rows on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The black fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum melanopus has large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a broad, feather-like shape.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in clusters, blooming in late spring, and they are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in moist soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum melanopus is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and other moist environments. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems. It is also present in some Caribbean islands and the southern United States.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these humid, coastal or lowland habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum melanopus was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This plant has become naturalized in these areas, often forming dense stands that can alter local ecosystems. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant species and habitat structure.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some parts of its range.</p>
