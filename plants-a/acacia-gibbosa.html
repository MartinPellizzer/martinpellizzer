                        <h1>Acacia gibbosa</h1>
<p>Acacia gibbosa, commonly known as the white wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and phyllodes that are narrow and linear. The plant produces small yellow flowers in globular heads, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Acacia gibbosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought tolerance through its deep root system.</p>
<p>Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a feature common in many acacia species, which helps reduce water loss.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia gibbosa belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their relatives, known for their primitive features and vascular systems. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have compound leaves and flowers with a distinctive structure. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume family, characterized by pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees known for their acicular leaves and often showy flower clusters.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia gibbosa, a specific type of acacia found in certain regions, distinguished by its unique morphological features.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia gibbosa is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southern and western regions of the state. This plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid environments of the region. It is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands.</p>
<p>Acacia gibbosa plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia gibbosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the country in the early 20th century by horticulturalists who sought to diversify the local flora with exotic species. Despite its initial popularity, it has since become a weed in some areas, particularly in the North Island, where it spreads rapidly in disturbed soils. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Efforts are now underway to manage its spread and prevent further invasion of natural habitats.</p>
