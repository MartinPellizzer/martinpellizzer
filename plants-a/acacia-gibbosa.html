                    <h1>Acacia gibbosa</h1>
<p>Acacia gibbosa, commonly known as the white wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and phyllodes that are narrow and linear. The plant produces small yellow flowers in globular heads, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Acacia gibbosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought tolerance through its deep root system.</p>
<p>Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a feature common in many acacia species, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
