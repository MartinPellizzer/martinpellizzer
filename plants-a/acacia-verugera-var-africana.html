It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia verugera var. africana is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in savannas, grasslands, and rocky outcrops where the climate is dry to semi-arid. This variety is well adapted to the region's variable rainfall and high temperatures. It often grows in association with other Acacia species and plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern part of the African continent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia verugera var. africana was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, particularly in the eastern and western parts of the country. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen along roadsides and in disturbed habitats. Its introduction has led to some ecological concerns due to its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
