                    <h1>Asplenium mannii var. kauaiense</h1>
<p>Asplenium mannii var. kauaiense, commonly known as the Kauai spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow in dense clusters on rock surfaces. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in coastal or forested areas. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying endemic flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
