                <h1>Aconitum bulbiferum</h1>
<p>Aconitum bulbiferum, commonly known as the bulbous monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking purple to blue flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, which are typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant produces bulbous structures known as corms, which serve as storage organs and enable it to survive in harsh alpine conditions. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, waxy texture.</p>
<p>Aconitum bulbiferum is also notable for containing potent alkaloids, making it both a valuable subject in botanical research and a plant to handle with caution.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum bulbiferum has large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure up to 30 cm in length, with a dark green color and a velvety texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and smooth, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher as the plant matures. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, and consist of five petals arranged in a spurred shape, blooming in late summer and attracting pollinators like bees through nectar. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, serving as storage organs and contributing to the plant's hardy nature.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum bulbiferum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soils. This species is commonly found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 5,000 meters. It is adapted to harsh climatic conditions and is often part of the flora in these remote and rugged landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum bulbiferum was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue-violet flowers and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in moist, shaded woodland areas. The plant's introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in some ecosystems. Despite its beauty, it is highly toxic and requires caution when handling.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now expanding beyond its original cultivation range.</p>
