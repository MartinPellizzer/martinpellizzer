                    <h1>Aconitum bulbiferum</h1>
<p>Aconitum bulbiferum, commonly known as the bulbous monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking purple to blue flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, which are typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant produces bulbous structures known as corms, which serve as storage organs and enable it to survive in harsh alpine conditions. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, waxy texture.</p>
<p>Aconitum bulbiferum is also notable for containing potent alkaloids, making it both a valuable subject in botanical research and a plant to handle with caution.</p>
