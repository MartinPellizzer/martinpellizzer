                    <h1>Ariocarpus</h1>
<p>Ariocarpus, commonly known as the "lion's paw," is a genus of succulent cacti native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their thick, fleshy stems and spiny, segmented appearance, which help them conserve water in arid environments. They typically produce small, yellowish flowers during the spring or early summer. Ariocarpus species are often grown as ornamental plants due to their unique and striking appearance.</p>
<p>However, they are generally slow-growing and require specific care to thrive.</p>
