                    <h1>Arenaria halophila</h1>
<p>Arenaria halophila, commonly known as saltgrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to high salinity and arid conditions, making it a key component of salt marsh ecosystems. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it often forms dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Arenaria halophila plays an important ecological role in maintaining the balance of coastal habitats.</p>
