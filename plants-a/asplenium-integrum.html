<p>Asplenium integrum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sorus on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium integrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its delicate, lace-like appearance.</p>
