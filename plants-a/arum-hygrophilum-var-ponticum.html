<p>Arum hygrophilum var. ponticum, commonly known as the Pontic arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in eastern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, adapted for water retention.
