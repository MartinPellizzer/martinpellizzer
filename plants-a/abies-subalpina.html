                    <h1>Abies subalpina</h1>
<p>Abies subalpina, commonly known as the Alpine fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in alpine and subalpine zones where temperatures are cool and the soil is rocky or poor. The tree has a slender, conical shape with dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally along the branches. Its cones are cylindrical and contain small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to harsh climates and plays a significant role in the ecological structure of its native habitats.</p>
