                        <h1>Abies subalpina</h1>
<p>Abies subalpina, commonly known as the Alpine fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in alpine and subalpine zones where temperatures are cool and the soil is rocky or poor. The tree has a slender, conical shape with dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally along the branches. Its cones are cylindrical and contain small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to harsh climates and plays a significant role in the ecological structure of its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies subalpina is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly the Alps and the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Central and Eastern Europe, including the Balkans and the Apennines. This species thrives in high-altitude environments, typically above 1,500 meters, where the climate is cool and moist. It is commonly found in mixed forests alongside other coniferous species such as Picea and Pinus.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the presence of well-drained soils and a temperate continental climate.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies subalpina was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Pacific Northwest of North America, where it thrives in subalpine and alpine environments. This species is often planted in landscapes for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, evergreen stands. It is also used in reforestation efforts due to its resilience and adaptability.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
