<p>Andropogon elegantissimus var. arabicus, commonly known as the Arabian switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Its resilience makes it a valuable species for erosion control and as a forage plant in dry climates.</p>
