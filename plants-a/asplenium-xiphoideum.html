<p>Asplenium xiphoideum, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to form dense mats. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Asplenium xiphoideum prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
