<p>Avena pratensis var. scheuchzeri, commonly known as the alpine oat, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens with high-altitude conditions.</p>
