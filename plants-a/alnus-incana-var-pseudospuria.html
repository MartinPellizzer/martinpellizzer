                    <h1>Alnus incana var. pseudospuria</h1>
<p>Alnus incana var. pseudospuria, commonly known as the dwarf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arctic and alpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, simple leaves that are alternate and often covered with a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered catkins that are typically male, while female flowers are solitary and appear in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
