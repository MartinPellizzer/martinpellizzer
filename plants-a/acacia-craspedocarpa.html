                        <h1>Acacia craspedocarpa</h1>
<p>Acacia craspedocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and phyllodes that are narrow and slightly curved. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer to early autumn, which are clustered in spherical heads. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a feature common in many Acacia species, reducing water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia craspedocarpa is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in sandy soils across the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia craspedocarpa belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of a secondary cell wall and complex structures like stomata. Its class is Equisetopsida, which consists of ferns and their relatives, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which comprises plants with distinctive flowers and includes legumes that form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, characterized by their pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees known for their unique leaf structures and often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia craspedocarpa, a specific type of acacia found in certain regions, known for its distinctive morphology and ecological role.</p>
