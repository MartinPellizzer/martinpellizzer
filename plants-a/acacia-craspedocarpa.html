                    <h1>Acacia craspedocarpa</h1>
<p>Acacia craspedocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and phyllodes that are narrow and slightly curved. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer to early autumn, which are clustered in spherical heads. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a feature common in many Acacia species, reducing water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia craspedocarpa is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in sandy soils across the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
