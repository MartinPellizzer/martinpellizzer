<p>Aquilegia vulgaris monstr.</p>
<p>inversa, commonly known as the inverted common columbine, is a variant of the common columbine characterized by its unique floral morphology.

<p>Botanically, it retains the same basic structure as the standard species, featuring spurred petals and a compound ovary. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with palmately compound leaves and vibrant blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental qualities.</p>
