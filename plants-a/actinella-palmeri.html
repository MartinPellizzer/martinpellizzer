                <h1>Actinella palmeri</h1>
<p>Actinella palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's actinella, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Actinella palmeri is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinella palmeri has small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, blooming in early spring, and is pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella palmeri is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of California. This plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in desert and semi-arid environments. It is often associated with areas of low rainfall and high sunlight exposure.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella palmeri was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils along roadsides, in urban areas, and in dry, open habitats. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often colonizing areas with minimal vegetation. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it has become a weed in some regions.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities and ecosystem balance.</p>
