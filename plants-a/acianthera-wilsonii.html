                <h1>Acianthera wilsonii</h1>
<p>Acianthera wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's acianthera, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers with prominent lips, which are adapted for specific pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and montane regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera wilsonii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size, typically around 3-5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright with minimal branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white or pale pink petals and a distinctive spurred structure, blooming during the late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera wilsonii is primarily native to Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Jamaica, Leeward Is., Puerto Rico, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It typically grows in humid, forested areas with high rainfall. The plant is commonly associated with rocky or shaded habitats.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of the Caribbean and South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera wilsonii was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction is often linked to human activities such as landscaping and accidental spread through waterways.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
