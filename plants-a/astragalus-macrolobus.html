<p>Astragalus macrolobus, commonly known as the large-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with compound leaves that are often large and hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Astragalus macrolobus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
