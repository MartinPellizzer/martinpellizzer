<p>Aspidium molle var. truncatum, commonly known as the cut-leaf water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a truncated or cut appearance at the tips. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream sides and wetlands. Its rhizomes are often submerged or partially submerged, anchoring it to the substrate.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually light green and can be used in ornamental gardening due to their aesthetic appeal.</p>
