                    <h1>Arenaria favargeri</h1>
<p>Arenaria favargeri, commonly known as the favargeri sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of hairy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable species for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions.</p>
