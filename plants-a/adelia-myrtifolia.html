                <h1>Adelia myrtifolia</h1>
<p>Adelia myrtifolia, commonly known as the pink myrtle, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a glossy appearance.</p>
<p>Adelia myrtifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia myrtifolia has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to efficiently absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia myrtifolia is primarily native to the southern parts of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the regions of the Swan River and the Avon-Como area. This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the margins of freshwater bodies. It is adapted to the semi-arid and arid climates of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Adelia myrtifolia is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands within its geographic range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia myrtifolia was mainly introduced to areas with warm, temperate climates and well-drained soils, often in regions with mild winters and hot, dry summers.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is commonly found in coastal and inland areas where it can establish itself along slopes and rocky outcrops. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. It has been introduced to several countries in the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
