                    <h1>Aspidium aculeatum var. proliferum</h1>
<p>Aspidium aculeatum var. proliferum, commonly known as the spreading wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth and fronds that are typically bipinnate or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its ability to spread vegetatively through its rhizomes, contributing to its prevalence in suitable habitats.</p>
