                    <h1>Acacia diptera var. erioptera</h1>
<p>Acacia diptera var. erioptera, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive phyllodes, which are flattened, leaf-like structures that reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. Its bark is often smooth and greyish, and it is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects.</p>
