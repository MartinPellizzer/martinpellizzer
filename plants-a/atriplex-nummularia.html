<p>Atriplex nummularia, commonly known as silverleaf sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in compact inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. It is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Atriplex nummularia is drought-tolerant and is used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits.</p>
