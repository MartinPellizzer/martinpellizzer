                        <h1>Acantholimon aristulatum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon aristulatum, commonly known as the tall sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, narrow leaves, and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and inland deserts.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in arid gardens.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acantholimon aristulatum belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which consists of vascular plants that include ferns and their allies, often with a distinct life cycle involving spores. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many primitive angiosperms with a wide range of morphological diversity.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes plants with distinctive flowers and often contains species adapted to arid environments. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, a family of flowering plants commonly known as the leadplant family, which includes many species with medicinal properties. Its genus is Acantholimon, a group of flowering plants typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by their succulent leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon aristulatum, a specific plant within the genus Acantholimon, known for its unique floral structure and adaptation to harsh environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon aristulatum is primarily native to Iran.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh climate of the Iranian landscape. It is commonly seen in mountainous areas and along the edges of deserts.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Iran.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon aristulatum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dune environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in disturbed or open habitats. This plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it suitable for regions with low precipitation. It is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>However, its introduction can sometimes lead to competition with native species in certain ecosystems.</p>
