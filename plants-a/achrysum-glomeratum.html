                <h1>Achrysum glomeratum</h1>
<p>Achrysum glomeratum, commonly known as clustered achrysum, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Achrysum glomeratum is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to bloom throughout the growing season.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achrysum glomeratum has compact, bushy growth with stems that are typically green and slightly hairy, growing in a low, spreading pattern.</p>
<p>Its leaves are narrow, linear, and grass-like, arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture. The flowers are small, clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, with violet to purple petals that bloom in late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achrysum glomeratum is primarily native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Western Cape Province, particularly in the fynbos biome. This plant typically grows in coastal and mountainous areas with a Mediterranean climate. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open vegetation types.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within South Africa due to its particular ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achrysum glomeratum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun, typically in coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils such as roadsides, fields, and garden beds. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its vibrant flowers. It has a low maintenance requirement, making it popular among gardeners.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
