                    <h1>Antimima addita</h1>
<p>Antimima addita, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which resemble the ghostly appearance of its common name. The plant has a slender, leafless stem and produces small, delicate leaves near the base. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on the bark of trees in swampy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
