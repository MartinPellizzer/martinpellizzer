<p>Agelaea macrophysa, commonly known as the giant sphaerocarp, is a rare and unique fern species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, club-shaped sporangia that are prominently displayed on the underside of its fronds. The plant exhibits a distinctive morphology with long, slender fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Its reproductive structures are highly specialized, contributing to its ecological significance in tropical ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Agelaea macrophysa is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
