                <h1>Acronia oncoglossa</h1>
<p>Acronia oncoglossa, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Its unique leaf shape and delicate flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia oncoglossa has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia oncoglossa is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. This species thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often associated with areas of high water table. Acronia oncoglossa is an aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that plays an important role in the ecological balance of its wetland environment.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the coastal and inland regions of the southeastern U.S. where suitable habitat conditions exist.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia oncoglossa was mainly introduced to the eastern United States, particularly in the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It was first documented in Florida and has since spread to other coastal areas. This plant is commonly found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woodlands. Its introduction is believed to be accidental, likely through contaminated soil or seed transport.</p>
<p>It has become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
