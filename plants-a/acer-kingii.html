                <h1>Acer kingii</h1>
<p>Acer kingii, commonly known as the Korean maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer kingii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip; they are dark green in summer and turn vibrant yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery strips. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in late spring, arranged in clusters, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer kingii is a rare and critically endangered species native to the mountainous regions of central China, specifically in Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces.</p>
<p>Although it was once more widely distributed, its current range is severely restricted due to habitat loss and fragmentation. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, typically between 2,000 and 3,500 meters above sea level. The plant is found in shaded, temperate forests with well-drained soils, often in areas with limited human disturbance.</p>
<p>Due to its extremely limited population and ongoing threats, Acer kingii is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer kingii is a rare and beautiful maple species native to the Himalayas, known for its vibrant autumn foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period to germinate successfully. The growth cycle of Acer kingii involves a slow establishment phase, followed by steady growth in favorable conditions, typically reaching maturity over several decades.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of balanced fertilizer in spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and encourage healthy growth. It is relatively resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its ornamental value and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer kingii is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer kingii plays a role in improving soil quality by enhancing nutrient cycling through leaf litter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer kingii is a species of maple tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential nutritional benefits. In traditional Chinese medicine, Acer kingii has been used to treat various ailments, including inflammation and skin conditions. Industrially, its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, making it suitable for crafting and furniture production.</p>
<p>Culturally, the tree symbolizes resilience and beauty, often featured in local landscapes and artistic expressions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer kingii has several varieties and cultivars that are highly valued in horticulture for their unique leaf coloration and ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aureum', known for its golden-yellow leaves, and 'Variegatum', which features striking white-variegated foliage. The species is also involved in hybridization with other maple species, leading to the development of ornamental hybrids that exhibit enhanced cold hardiness and seasonal color changes. These hybrids are particularly important in landscaping due to their adaptability to various climates and their ability to add visual interest throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer kingii and its cultivars and hybrids play a significant role in the horticultural industry, contributing to the diversity of ornamental trees available to gardeners and landscapers.</p>
