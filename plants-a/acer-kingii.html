                <h1>Acer kingii</h1>
<p>Acer kingii, commonly known as the Korean maple, is a deciduous tree native to Korea and parts of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree typically grows to a height of 8–15 meters and has a rounded crown. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer kingii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are bright green during the growing season and turn vibrant yellow in autumn. The stem is slender, with a smooth, grey-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight, upright growth pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated, and bloom before the leaves fully develop.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous, helping to anchor the plant in its rocky or forested habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer kingii is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and environmental changes. It thrives in moist, cool climates with well-drained soils, typically found in forests and rocky slopes. This species is typically found at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Acer kingii is listed as endangered, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer kingii is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its unique foliage and slow growth rate.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity over several decades, making it ideal for long-term landscaping.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires regular watering during dry periods without becoming waterlogged. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications in spring, while pruning is needed to shape the tree and remove dead branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or heathers can enhance its aesthetic appeal and create a natural, woodland-like environment.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer kingii is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding land.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer kingii plays a role in improving soil quality by contributing organic matter through leaf litter.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer kingii is a rare maple species native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its seeds may have minor nutritional value. In traditional medicine, it has been used for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Its unique foliage makes it a sought-after plant in horticulture and landscape design.</p>
<p>Although it has limited industrial applications, its conservation status highlights its importance in biodiversity and ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer kingii has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Coral Autumn,' which are known for their vibrant fall color and compact growth habit. Hybrids of Acer kingii are often bred to enhance traits such as disease resistance, growth form, and seasonal color display. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their adaptability and aesthetic appeal in landscaping.</p>
<p>They are widely used in gardens and parks to add visual interest and seasonal variation.</p>
