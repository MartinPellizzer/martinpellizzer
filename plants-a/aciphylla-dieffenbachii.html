<p>Aciphylla dieffenbachii, commonly known as the Dieffenbach's bristlebush, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in heads, typical of the daisy family. It is well adapted to rocky and coastal habitats, often found in the South Island of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciphylla dieffenbachii has small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, forming a rosette at the base of the plant, with a bluish-gray color and a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The stem is short and stout, with a rough, fibrous bark that is typically grayish-brown in color.

<p>Aciphylla dieffenbachii is primarily native to the Chatham Islands.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the unique ecosystems of these islands, which are part of New Zealand. It thrives in the coastal and inland areas characterized by strong winds and sandy soils. The species is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of the Chatham Islands.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in the local biodiversity and is a distinctive feature of the region's flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla dieffenbachii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing plant that thrives in coastal and sandy environments. This species is commonly found in the northern parts of the country, particularly in the North Island. It is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance.</p>
