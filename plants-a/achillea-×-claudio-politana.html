                <h1>Achillea × claudio-politana</h1>
<p>Achillea × claudio-politana, commonly known as the hybrid yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Achillea millefolium (common yarrow) and Achillea ptarmica (chicory yarrow), resulting in a plant with intermediate characteristics. The species features finely divided, fern-like leaves and flat, composite flower heads that range in color from white to pink or purple. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This hybrid is valued in gardens for its resilience and ability to attract pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × claudio-politana has basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color, with a woolly texture and a slightly serrated margin, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and somewhat reddish-brown in color, with a branching growth pattern that rises from the base. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × claudio-politana is a hybrid plant native to the Mediterranean region, specifically originating from the intersection of its parent species, Achillea ligulata and Achillea nobilis.</p>
<p>While it was originally found in southern Europe, its current distribution includes cultivation in gardens and greenhouses across temperate regions worldwide. It thrives in well-drained soils and sunny environments, typically found in rocky or gravelly areas. This plant grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to approximately 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its status as a hybrid and limited natural occurrence, it is not considered a conservation concern, though it is primarily cultivated rather than found in the wild.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea × claudio-politana is a hybrid perennial known for its vibrant, fluffy yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in the spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its appearance and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
