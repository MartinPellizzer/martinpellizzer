                    <h1>Asplenium anguineum</h1>
<p>Asplenium anguineum, commonly known as the red-stemmed spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth habit with dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish at the base. Its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the leaves, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Asplenium anguineum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
