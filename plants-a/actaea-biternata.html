                <h1>Actaea biternata</h1>
<p>Actaea biternata, commonly known as the red baneberry, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is often appreciated in gardens, though caution is necessary due to its poisonous nature.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea biternata has compound, trifoliate leaves that are palmately arranged, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a slightly serrated margin. The stem is slender and hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters during late spring to early summer, which are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a red, berry-like structure containing several seeds, which are dispersed by birds and other animals.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea biternata is a flowering plant native to eastern North America, primarily found in the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas such as New England, the Appalachian Mountains, and parts of Ontario. It thrives in moist, shaded environments like woodlands and stream banks. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Actaea biternata is considered a species of concern in some regions, though its overall conservation status is currently listed as least concern at the global level.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actaea biternata is a striking perennial plant known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and showy white flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in a cool, moist environment. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 2 to 3 years, with a flowering period in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires consistent watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning dead foliage in late autumn helps maintain its appearance. Actaea biternata is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract slugs or leaf spot, which can be managed with organic controls.</p>
<p>It pairs well with hostas, ferns, and other shade-loving plants in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
