                <h1>Actaea biternata</h1>
<p>Actaea biternata, commonly known as the white cohosh, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with three pairs of leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in early summer, followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in rich, loamy soils.</p>
<p>Actaea biternata is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea biternata has compound, trifoliate leaves that are palmately arranged, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, typically 5-10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes more reddish-brown with age, and it grows in a straight, upright pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers arranged in an umbel, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a red, berry-like aggregate composed of follicles, which disperse seeds through animal consumption and seed dispersal via feces.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous, underground structures that store nutrients and help the plant survive through periods of dormancy.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea biternata is primarily native to Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forested areas and mountainous regions across these countries. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with partial to full shade. It is often associated with temperate climates and is part of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to these specific geographic regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea biternata was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, including horticultural trade and landscape gardening.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, particularly in temperate climates. The plant's introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. It thrives in moist, shaded areas and can spread rapidly through rhizomes.</p>
<p>Monitoring its distribution is essential to assess its ecological impact and manage its spread effectively.</p>
