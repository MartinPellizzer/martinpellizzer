                <h1>Aechmea digitata</h1>
<p>Aechmea digitata, commonly known as the pink pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from the environment. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with pink or red bracts that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Its foliage is typically dark green with a metallic sheen, and the leaves are stiff and sword-like in appearance.</p>
<p>Aechmea digitata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea digitata has rosette-shaped leaves that are sword-like, stiff, and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving them a silvery appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged in a spiral around the central rosette, with each leaf measuring up to 30 cm in length and 3 cm in width. The plant lacks a true stem, but its pseudostem is formed by the tightly packed leaf bases, which are smooth and green in color. The flowers are borne in a spike-like inflorescence, with white to pale blue petals and a yellow center, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry containing numerous small, black seeds, which are dispersed by birds and other animals.</p>
