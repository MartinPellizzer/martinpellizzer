                    <h1>Agriphyllum asteroides</h1>
<p>Agriphyllum asteroides, commonly known as the starflower or desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub that produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the spring. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Agriphyllum asteroides is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
