                    <h1>Aconitum anthora var. hians</h1>
<p>Aconitum anthora var. hians, commonly known as the Alpine monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has palmate leaves with deeply lobed segments, and its stems are generally unbranched and covered in coarse hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
