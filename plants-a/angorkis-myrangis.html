                    <h1>Angorkis myrangis</h1>
<p>Angorkis myrangis, commonly known as the coastal wallaby bush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize sandy soils along the coastline.</p>
<p>Angorkis myrangis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh, maritime conditions.</p>
