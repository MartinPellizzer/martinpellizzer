<p>Abrodictyum cupressoides, commonly known as the African evergreen cycad, is a species of cycad native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, needle-like leaves that resemble those of a conifer. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to environmental stress, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
