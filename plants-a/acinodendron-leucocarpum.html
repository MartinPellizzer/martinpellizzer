                <h1>Acinodendron leucocarpum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron leucocarpum, commonly known as the white-fruited acinodendron, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns white when mature, giving the plant its common name.</p>
<p>It is often found in moist, shaded areas of forests and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron leucocarpum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale grey bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are arranged in clusters, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind due to their inconspicuous petals and stamen. The fruit is a fleshy, white berry that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by animals feeding on the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron leucocarpum is primarily native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the dry, deciduous forests of the southeastern part of the country. This plant typically grows in areas with well-drained soil and receives moderate to high levels of sunlight. It is commonly associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Madagascar.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron leucocarpum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with ample sunlight and moderate rainfall, making it suitable for cultivation in regions like Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. The plant is often used for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and unique fruit structure. Its introduction has been primarily driven by horticultural interests and the demand for exotic plant species.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native habitats.</p>
