                    <h1>Astragalus junatovii</h1>
<p>Astragalus junatovii, commonly known as the Junatov's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect stem and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, typical of many Astragalus species. It is adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
