                <h1>Acorus xiangyeus</h1>
<p>Acorus xiangyeus, commonly known as the Xiangyeus sweet flag, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its aromatic rhizomes and broad, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus xiangyeus has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and cylindrical, with a light green to pale yellow color, growing in a clumping pattern. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spadices, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a spadix that develops into a cluster of small, dry berries, with seeds dispersed by water and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming a dense underground network that helps the plant anchor and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus xiangyeus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, Vietnam, and Cambodia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland environments, marshes, and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies. This plant thrives in humid climates with abundant moisture and partial to full shade. Its natural habitat includes rice paddies, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic areas.</p>
<p>Acorus xiangyeus plays an important ecological role in these regions by supporting local biodiversity and contributing to water filtration.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus xiangyeus was mainly introduced to wetland and riparian areas where it thrives in moist, shallow waters.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. This plant is often used in aquatic landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native habitat for ecological and ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments.</p>
