                    <h1>Amphorella castanea</h1>
<p>Amphorella castanea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain one or two seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its dense, reddish-brown color and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as an endangered species.</p>
