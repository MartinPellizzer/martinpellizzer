<p>Abies guatemalensis subsp.</p>
<p>rushforthii, commonly known as the Rushforth's fir, is a rare and endemic species native to high-altitude regions of Guatemala. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are slightly twisted.</p>
<p>The cones are typically short and cylindrical, maturing to a reddish-brown color. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils, often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
