<p>Aechmea mitis, commonly known as the silver vanda, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a silvery or white powdery coating, giving the plant its common name. It produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant pink or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
