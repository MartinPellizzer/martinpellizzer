<p>Asplenium serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices, walls, and forest floors. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a dark green color and a leathery texture. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Asplenium serrulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging growing conditions.</p>
