                <h1>Adiantum annamense</h1>
<p>Adiantum annamense, commonly known as the Annam fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a metallic sheen. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are short and often covered with a thick layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures.</p>
<p>Adiantum annamense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum annamense has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feather-like appearance, typically ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green, with a smooth, leathery texture, and are arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows in a vertical pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-yellow in color, blooming in late spring, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum annamense is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in mountainous areas with high humidity. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing near streams or in dense forests. Its distribution is largely restricted to the Indochina Peninsula and parts of southern China.</p>
<p>Adiantum annamense is typically found at elevations ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum annamense was mainly introduced to areas with high humidity and shaded environments, such as tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in rocky crevices. This plant is commonly cultivated as an ornamental species due to its delicate fronds and ability to tolerate indoor conditions. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native habitat, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely influenced by human activity and the availability of suitable microhabitats.</p>
