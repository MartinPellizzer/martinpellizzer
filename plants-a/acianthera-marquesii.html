                <h1>Acianthera marquesii</h1>
<p>Acianthera marquesii, commonly known as the Marquesan orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera marquesii has elliptical,革质 (leathery) leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, white to pale pink, with three petals and a spur, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera marquesii is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the humid forests of the southeastern region of Brazil. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and moderate temperatures. The plant is commonly found in areas with dense vegetation and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific habitats within this geographic region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera marquesii was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. This plant is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses due to its ornamental value and unique floral characteristics. Its introduction has been primarily through horticultural trade and conservation efforts aimed at preserving its genetic diversity.</p>
<p>However, its spread outside its native range is limited due to specific environmental requirements.</p>
