<p>Acmispon decumbens, commonly known as desert blueweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Acmispon decumbens is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with minimal water availability.</p>
