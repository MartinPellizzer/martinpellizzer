                <h1>Adenolinum pyrenaicum</h1>
<p>Adenolinum pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean adenolinum, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the Pyrenees mountain range.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white or pale green flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it highly vulnerable to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenolinum pyrenaicum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth texture and a light greenish-brown color, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses seeds through wind, and the seeds are tiny, dry, and easily carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenolinum pyrenaicum is primarily native to the Iberian Peninsula, specifically in Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and coastal areas, particularly in the western and central regions of these countries. This plant thrives in Mediterranean climates characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. It is often associated with limestone soils and can be found in open habitats such as cliffs and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenolinum pyrenaicum was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several European countries, including France, Spain, and Italy, where it thrives in gardens and landscaped areas. The plant's spread is primarily through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental dispersal. It is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, management strategies are being developed to control its spread.</p>
