<p>Antennaria friesiana var. beringensis, commonly known as the Beringian mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically forms a dense mat of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
