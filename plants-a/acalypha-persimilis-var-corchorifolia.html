                        <h1>Acalypha persimilis var. corchorifolia</h1>
<p>Acalypha persimilis var. corchorifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silky mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features soft, fuzzy leaves that are often a deep green or reddish hue, providing a striking visual appeal. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, which bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for garden use, though it can be invasive in certain environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha persimilis var. corchorifolia is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>This variant of Acalypha persimilis is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. It thrives in coastal areas and lowland forests, where it contributes to the local biodiversity. The plant is well adapted to the warm, humid climate of these regions.</p>
<p>Its natural range is limited to these specific islands, where it has evolved over time.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha persimilis var. corchorifolia was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there in the late 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic plants for landscaping. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal by wind and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native ornamental species.</p>
