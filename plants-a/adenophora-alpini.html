                <h1>Adenophora alpini</h1>
<p>Adenophora alpini, commonly known as the alpine adenophora, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are opposite, lanceolate, and often covered with fine hairs.</p>
<p>Adenophora alpini is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora alpini has leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 2 to 6 cm in length, usually with a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and hairy, with a light green to pale brown color, growing in a clumping or spreading pattern. Its flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in inflorescences, with white or pale blue petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant establish itself in rocky or alpine environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora alpini is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, including provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, and Tibet.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations, typically between 2,500 and 4,500 meters above sea level. This plant is adapted to cold climates and is often found in areas with well-drained soils. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is known for its bell-shaped flowers.</p>
<p>Adenophora alpini is an important component of the alpine flora in these regions, contributing to the biodiversity of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora alpini was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its ornamental value due to its attractive blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is known for its ability to tolerate cold temperatures. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>However, its spread is generally limited and it does not typically become invasive in these areas.</p>
