<p>It is characterized by its succulent, deltoid-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in compact clusters, typically in the spring. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to extreme conditions makes it a valuable plant for stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
