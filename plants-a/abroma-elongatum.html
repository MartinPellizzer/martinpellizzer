                        <h1>Abroma elongatum</h1>
<p>Abroma elongatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed abroma, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are ovate and slightly hairy, while its stems are slender and often branched.</p>
<p>Abroma elongatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abroma elongatum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open woodland, grasslands, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the southern hemisphere.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abroma elongatum was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries like South Africa, Namibia, and Mozambique.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy or rocky coastal areas where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant is often seen growing along dunes and near the shoreline, where it plays a role in stabilizing the sand. It is a hardy species that can tolerate salt spray and strong winds, making it well adapted to its coastal environment.</p>
<p>Its introduction has been largely unintentional, as it was likely dispersed by wind or water along with other coastal vegetation.</p>
