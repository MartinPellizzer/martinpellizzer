<p>Aristolochia odoratissima, commonly known as the sweet-scented Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often adorned with a waxy, purple to brown coloration. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and emits a strong, sweet fragrance, especially in the evening. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by specific moths, which are attracted to the scent and the dark, tubular shape.</p>
<p>The genus Aristolochia contains several species with similar morphological features and ecological roles.</p>
