<p>Aegilops longissima subsp.</p>
<p>sharonensis, commonly known as Sharon's longstem wild wheat, is a perennial grass native to the Levant region. It is characterized by its long, slender spikelets and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale green florets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
