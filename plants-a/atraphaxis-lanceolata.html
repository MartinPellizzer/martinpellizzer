                    <h1>Atraphaxis lanceolata</h1>
<p>Atraphaxis lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf desert shrub, is a hardy plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it well-adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Atraphaxis lanceolata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
