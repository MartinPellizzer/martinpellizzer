<p>Acrolasia pectinata, commonly known as the African pincushion plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.

Its stems are typically woody and can branch out to form a compact, bushy shape.</p>
<p>Acrolasia pectinata is well adapted to dry climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
