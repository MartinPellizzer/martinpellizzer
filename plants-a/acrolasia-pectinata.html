                <h1>Acrolasia pectinata</h1>
<p>Acrolasia pectinata, commonly known as the African pincushion plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. Its stems are typically woody and can branch out to form a compact, bushy shape.</p>
<p>Acrolasia pectinata is well adapted to dry climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrolasia pectinata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers with four petals, blooming in spring, and is pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia pectinata is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in tropical rainforests and secondary growth habitats. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and New Guinea.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with areas that have a warm, moist climate year-round.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia pectinata was mainly introduced to New Zealand in the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats, including coastal dunes and disturbed soils. The plant's ability to thrive in coastal environments has led to its establishment along the North Island coastline. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its invasive growth habits.</p>
<p>Its distribution continues to expand, raising concerns about its impact on native flora.</p>
