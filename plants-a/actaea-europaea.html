                <h1>Actaea europaea</h1>
<p>Actaea europaea, commonly known as European black cohosh, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and large, palmately compound leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its roots are often harvested for medicinal use, containing compounds like actein and tannins.</p>
<p>Actaea europaea thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental and pharmacological properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea europaea has palmately compound leaves that are bright green, with five to seven leaflets arranged radiating from a single point, each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows in a single, upright direction. The plant produces small, white or cream-colored flowers arranged in an umbel, blooming in late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a red, berry-like capsule containing small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by birds eating the berries.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively through underground stems.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea europaea is primarily native to Belarus, Czechia-Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Ukraine.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in forested areas and along riverbanks in these regions. It thrives in temperate climates with moist, well-drained soils. The species is known for its striking purple flowers and is often used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea europaea was mainly introduced to Europe through historical trade routes and botanical exchanges.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions across the continent, particularly in temperate woodlands and shaded gardens. The plant's introduction has led to its establishment in both cultivated and wild environments. Its spread is often associated with human activity, including horticultural practices and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered an invasive species in most of its range.</p>
