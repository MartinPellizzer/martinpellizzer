                    <h1>Artemisia jenisea</h1>
<p>Artemisia jenisea, commonly known as Siberian wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia jenisea is adapted to harsh conditions, including freezing temperatures and poor soil, making it a hardy species.</p>
<p>Its essential oils have been studied for potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed.</p>
