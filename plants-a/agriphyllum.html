                    <h1>Agriphyllum</h1>
<p>Agriphyllum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Agriphyllum is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
