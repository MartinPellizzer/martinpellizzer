                        <h1>Acacia reficiens subsp. misera</h1>
<p>Acacia reficiens subsp.</p>
<p>misera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and small, narrow phyllodes that are typically yellow-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow globular flower heads that appear in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia reficiens subsp.</p>
<p>misera is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana. This subspecies thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in savanna and shrubland habitats.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to drought conditions and can survive in areas with low rainfall. The plant is often seen growing along roadsides and in open grasslands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern parts of the African continent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia reficiens subsp.</p>
<p>misera was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature.</p>
<p>The species has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in coastal and urban areas.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and poses minimal ecological risk in its introduced range.</p>
