<p>Arctium dichotomum, commonly known as the common burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by the distinctive burrs that contain seeds with hooked bracts. These burs are adapted for dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing.</p>
<p>Arctium dichotomum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in waste areas.</p>
