<p>Arachniodes puncticulata, commonly known as the punctuated shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds with a finely toothed margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of foliage.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the undersides of the fronds.</p>
