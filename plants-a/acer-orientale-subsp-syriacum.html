                <h1>Acer orientale subsp. syriacum</h1>
<p>Acer orientale subsp.</p>
<p>syriacum, commonly known as the Syrian maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Syria and Turkey. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters with a broad, rounded crown.</p>
<p>The leaves are palmately lobed, with five to seven divisions, and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer orientale subsp.</p>
<p>syriacum has ovate to elliptical leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface turning reddish in autumn. The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, greyish-brown bark that exfoliates in thin, papery strips.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow-green flowers in clusters during late spring, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer orientale subsp.</p>
<p>syriacum is a rare subspecies native to the mountainous regions of Syria and Turkey. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated areas in the eastern Mediterranean, particularly in the Taurus Mountains.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in open woodland or shrubland environments. This species grows at elevations ranging from 1,200 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited natural range, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer orientale subsp.</p>
<p>syriacum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability. It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination.</p>
<p>The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot, and it benefits from companion planting with herbs like lavender or marigold.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer orientale subsp.</p>
<p>syriacum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to local biodiversity. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting ecological pollination networks.</p>
<p>The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through shade and nutrient cycling. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration, offering long-term ecological benefits to the environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer orientale subsp.</p>
<p>syriacum is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas in some regions. It has historical medicinal applications, with its bark and leaves potentially used for their astringent properties in folk medicine.</p>
<p>While not widely used in industry, it contributes to local biodiversity and supports ecological systems in its native habitats. Culturally, it may hold symbolic value in certain regions, representing resilience or natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological conservation and potential for future research highlights its importance in both environmental and scientific contexts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer orientale subsp.</p>
<p>syriacum has a limited number of naturally occurring varieties, but it is widely cultivated for its ornamental value. Popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Variegatum', which are prized for their striking foliage colors.</p>
<p>The species is also used in hybridization with other maple species to create new cultivars with enhanced traits. These hybrids often display improved cold hardiness and unique leaf patterns, making them popular in horticulture.</p>
<p>Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to add visual interest to gardens and landscapes with its vibrant autumn coloration.</p>
