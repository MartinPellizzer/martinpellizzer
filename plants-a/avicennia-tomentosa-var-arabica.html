                    <h1>Avicennia tomentosa var. arabica</h1>
<p>Avicennia tomentosa var. arabica, commonly known as the Arabian mangrove or white mangrove, is a halophytic species native to coastal regions of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It thrives in intertidal zones and is adapted to saline and brackish water environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance with white, woolly undersides on its leaves, which help reduce water loss. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Its pneumatophores, or breathing roots, allow it to absorb oxygen from the air in waterlogged soils.</p>
