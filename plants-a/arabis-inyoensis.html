<p>Arabis inyoensis, commonly known as Inyo rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mojave Desert in California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
