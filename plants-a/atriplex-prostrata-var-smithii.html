                    <h1>Atriplex prostrata var. smithii</h1>
<p>Atriplex prostrata var. smithii, commonly known as coastal saltbush, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with small, gray-green leaves covered in a dense layer of fine hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal and inland desert environments.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions.</p>
