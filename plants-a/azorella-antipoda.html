                    <h1>Azorella antipoda</h1>
<p>Azorella antipoda, commonly known as the Antarctic haircap, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America and Antarctica.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Poaceae family, commonly referred to as the grass family. This plant is notable for its ability to survive in extreme cold and high UV radiation, thanks to its dense, mat-forming growth habit. Its leaves are short and stiff, often covered in a layer of fine hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Azorella antipoda plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its harsh, polar environments.</p>
