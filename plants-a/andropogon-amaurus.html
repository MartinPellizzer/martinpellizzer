                    <h1>Andropogon amaurus</h1>
<p>Andropogon amaurus, commonly known as the panhandle bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland areas and along the edges of marshes, where it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it valuable in wetland restoration projects.</p>
<p>Andropogon amaurus is also an important forage plant for wildlife and livestock.</p>
