                <h1>Adenopeltis colliguaya</h1>
<p>Adenopeltis colliguaya, commonly known as the Colliguaya adenopeltis, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenopeltis colliguaya has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 3 to 7 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows in a bushy pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green in color, consisting of five petals and stamens, blooming during the spring and early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopeltis colliguaya is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Bolivia, Chile, and Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky habitats within the Andes mountain range. The plant thrives in temperate climates with cool temperatures and moderate rainfall. It is often associated with dry, sunny slopes and is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Adenopeltis colliguaya is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopeltis colliguaya was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas, establishing itself in native forests and along stream banks. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist environments have contributed to its invasive potential. It competes with native species for light and nutrients, altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on biodiversity.</p>
