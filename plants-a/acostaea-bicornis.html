                <h1>Acostaea bicornis</h1>
<p>Acostaea bicornis, commonly known as the two-horned water plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, forked leaves that resemble two horns, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowers emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Acostaea bicornis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acostaea bicornis has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, with a waxy green color and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement, varying in size from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, and are often clustered at the base of the plant. The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, with the seeds being tiny and lightweight, allowing them to travel considerable distances.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acostaea bicornis is primarily native to the southern United States, particularly in Texas and Oklahoma.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is commonly found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. This species is also known to occur in parts of northern Mexico, where it grows in similar environmental conditions. It is often associated with coastal or inland dunes and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and localized in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acostaea bicornis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in forest understories where there is high humidity and partial sunlight. This plant is commonly found in regions with cool climates and rich, well-drained soil. Its introduction has been noted in several parts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited due to its specific habitat requirements.</p>
