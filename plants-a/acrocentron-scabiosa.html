                <h1>Acrocentron scabiosa</h1>
<p>Acrocentron scabiosa, commonly known as the scarlet pimpernel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, which often change color in response to light and temperature. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. It is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Acrocentron scabiosa is a short-lived perennial that blooms from spring to early summer.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocentron scabiosa has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a slightly hairy surface and a grayish-green color; they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spherical inflorescences, with five pink to purple petals and yellow stamens; they bloom in early summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocentron scabiosa is primarily native to southern Africa, particularly in regions of South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils. This species is commonly seen in open habitats such as shrublands and grasslands. It is well adapted to withstand dry conditions and can survive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the southwestern and central parts of the continent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocentron scabiosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its showy flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed habitats. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types have contributed to its spread. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas, raising concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, management strategies are being explored to control its invasive potential.</p>
