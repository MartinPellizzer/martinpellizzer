                    <h1>Alyssum ovirense</h1>
<p>Alyssum ovirense, commonly known as the mountain alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across rocky and alpine environments. Alyssum ovirense thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to high-altitude conditions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it remains primarily wild in its native habitat.</p>
