<p>Aristolochia salpinx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Dutchman's pipe, is a perennial vine native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, maroon-colored flowers that resemble a pipe, which attract specific pollinators like wasps. The plant has heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its stems are woody and can climb by twining around supports.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care.</p>
