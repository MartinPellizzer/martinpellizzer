                    <h1>Acacia drepanocarpa</h1>
<p>Acacia drepanocarpa, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern and western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and feathery, bipinnate leaves that are typically green or bluish-green. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its seeds are encased in woody pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize sandy or rocky coastal soils.</p>
<p>Acacia drepanocarpa is well adapted to salty air and wind, making it a hardy species in harsh coastal environments.</p>
