                <h1>Acronia barbosae</h1>
<p>Acronia barbosae, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of tree native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Leguminosae and is characterized by its dense, dark wood with a rich, reddish-brown color. The plant has compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in musical instruments and fine furniture.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia barbosae has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring months and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia barbosae is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the coastal areas of the state of Rio de Janeiro. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. Acronia barbosae is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within the broader Atlantic Forest ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia barbosae was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern Brazil, particularly in the state of Rio Grande do Sul.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. The plant has been noted for its ability to colonize disturbed areas, contributing to the stabilization of coastal dunes. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>However, it is currently considered a minor invasive species in the region.</p>
