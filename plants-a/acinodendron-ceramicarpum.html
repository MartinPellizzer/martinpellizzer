                <h1>Acinodendron ceramicarpum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron ceramicarpum, commonly known as the ceramic-fruit tree, is a rare and unique plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, and often colorful fruits that resemble small ceramic vessels, hence its common name. The plant has compound leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in shaded, forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron ceramicarpum has leaves that are ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a glossy dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a smooth, pale gray bark that peels in thin layers, and it grows upright with a branched pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron ceramicarpum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates with high rainfall. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in swampy habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron ceramicarpum was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It has been commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique flowering patterns. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is primarily limited by temperature and soil conditions, though it can spread rapidly in favorable environments.</p>
