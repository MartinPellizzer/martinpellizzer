                <h1>Aechmea timida</h1>
<p>Aechmea timida, commonly known as the silver vase plant, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, silver-tipped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Aechmea timida is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea timida has rosette-shaped leaves that are sword-like, narrow, and pointed, with a dark green color and a waxy surface, arranged in a compact spiral pattern around the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright from the base of the rosette. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, typically red or orange, and bloom during the summer months; they are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The plant produces a capsule fruit containing small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing moisture from the surrounding soil.</p>
