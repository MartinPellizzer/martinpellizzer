                    <h1>Arundo micrantha</h1>
<p>Arundo micrantha, commonly known as narrowleaf reed, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with tiny, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, streambanks, and marshes.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
