                <h1>Acer tegmentosum subsp. glaucorufinerve</h1>
<p>Acer tegmentosum subsp.</p>
<p>glaucorufinerve, commonly known as the red-stemmed maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown stems and leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually hairy on the underside and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse by wind.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant fall color.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tegmentosum subsp.</p>
<p>glaucorufinerve has alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 5-10 cm long, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with yellowish-green petals and red stamens, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara with two wings, dispersing by wind, and the seeds are small and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tegmentosum subsp.</p>
<p>glaucorufinerve is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, particularly in provinces such as Sichuan and Yunnan. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas, where it thrives in moist, temperate forests.</p>
<p>This subspecies prefers cool, shaded environments with well-drained, acidic soils, often found in mixed deciduous-coniferous forests. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, where the climate is cool and humid.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat fragmentation, it is considered endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tegmentosum subsp.</p>
<p>glaucorufinerve is a unique maple species known for its ornamental value and adaptability. It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results.</p>
<p>The plant follows a typical deciduous growth cycle, shedding leaves in autumn and entering dormancy in winter. It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering promotes healthy growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with hostas or ferns enhances its aesthetic appeal in shaded garden settings.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer tegmentosum subsp.</p>
<p>glaucorufinerve is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity.</p>
<p>The tree acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing soil stability and supporting a diverse understory. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which helps bind soil and prevent runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and offers aesthetic value to its surrounding environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer tegmentosum subsp.</p>
<p>glaucorufinerve is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary uses, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas. It has been historically valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>While not widely used in industrial applications, its wood is durable and may find niche uses in crafts or small-scale woodworking. Culturally, it contributes to the biodiversity of its native regions and is appreciated by botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Its symbolic role is more subtle, representing the ecological importance of understory plants in forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer tegmentosum subsp.</p>
<p>glaucorufinerve has a range of varieties and cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, with popular cultivars such as 'Crimson King' and 'Variegatum' showcasing striking foliage colors. It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, leading to cultivars that exhibit enhanced growth habits and color variations.</p>
<p>These hybrids often display improved cold hardiness and disease resistance, making them more adaptable to different climates. The species is highly valued in horticulture for its unique leaf patterns and seasonal color changes.</p>
<p>Its cultivation contributes to the diversity of landscape trees and shrubs in gardens and parks.</p>
