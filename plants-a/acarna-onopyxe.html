                <h1>Acarna onopyxe</h1>
<p>Acarna onopyxe, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Acarna onopyxe is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acarna onopyxe has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a deep green color with a slightly glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, slightly hairy texture, and a reddish-brown color, growing in a bushy pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acarna onopyxe is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to some horticultural collections in temperate regions, expanding its current distribution beyond its original habitat. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil, typically found in the understory of dense forests. It is commonly found at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural populations, Acarna onopyxe is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acarna onopyxe is a striking flowering plant known for its vibrant, showy blooms and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seed, with cuttings being the most reliable and rapid method. The plant has a growth cycle that includes a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by a rest period in winter.</p>
<p>For optimal growth, it requires well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to encourage bushier growth are recommended, while monitoring for pests like aphids and diseases such as root rot is essential.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acarna onopyxe is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a range of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which feed on its seeds or use its foliage for shelter. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of nearby species by improving soil health. Additionally, its extensive root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along riverbanks and slopes.</p>
<p>Acarna onopyxe also contributes to biodiversity by supporting a wide array of ecological interactions in its habitat.</p>
