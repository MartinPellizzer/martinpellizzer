<p>Arytera karang, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its roots are adapted to tolerate brackish water, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Arytera karang plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for marine life.</p>
