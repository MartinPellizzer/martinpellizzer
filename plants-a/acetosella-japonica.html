<p>Acetosella japonica, commonly known as Japanese sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the base of the leaves. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid.</p>
<p>Acetosella japonica thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
