                <h1>Aconitum carpaticum</h1>
<p>Aconitum carpaticum, commonly known as the Carpathian monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It features striking blue-violet flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade.</p>
<p>However, it is highly toxic, containing potent alkaloids that can be lethal if ingested.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum carpaticum has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, typically growing upright with a grayish-brown bark. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense spikes, and bloom from late summer to early autumn, pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases small, dark seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for storage and anchoring the plant in rocky or mountainous habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum carpaticum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe, including parts of the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at higher elevations. This species is commonly found in alpine and subalpine habitats across countries such as Romania, Ukraine, and Russia. It is often associated with open meadows and forest edges in these regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in some areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum carpaticum was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its striking purple flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and naturalized areas across the eastern and central United States. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it adaptable to various garden conditions. Despite its beauty, it is toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to spread beyond cultivated areas into native ecosystems.</p>
