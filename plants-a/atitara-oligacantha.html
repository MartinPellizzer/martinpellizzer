                    <h1>Atitara oligacantha</h1>
<p>Atitara oligacantha, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, branching structure and small, clustered leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces tiny, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a subtle pink or white hue. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody capsule, which splits open to release the seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and high demand for its timber, the species faces significant conservation challenges.</p>
