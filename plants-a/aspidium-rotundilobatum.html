<p>Aspidium rotundilobatum, commonly known as the round-lobed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread across wetlands and marshy areas. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Aspidium rotundilobatum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
