<p>Arenaria androsacea, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed ground. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
