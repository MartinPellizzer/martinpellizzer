<p>Acer caudatum var. georgei, commonly known as the George's Weeping Maple, is a unique variant of the Weeping Maple, characterized by its pendulous branches and delicate, elongated leaves.</p>
<p>This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value, with its cascading foliage creating a striking visual effect in gardens and landscapes. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. The leaves turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall, adding seasonal interest.</p>
<p>However, it is relatively slow-growing and may require support due to its weak wood structure.</p>
