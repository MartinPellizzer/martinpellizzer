                    <h1>Acacia balsamea</h1>
<p>Acacia balsamea, commonly known as the balsam acacia, is a small, deciduous shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate, and its yellow to orange-pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain seeds, and it is well adapted to drought conditions. Acacia balsamea is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It also has historical uses in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities.</p>
