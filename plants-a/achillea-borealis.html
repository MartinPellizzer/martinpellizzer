                <h1>Achillea borealis</h1>
<p>Achillea borealis, commonly known as alpine yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its foliage consists of linear, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Achillea borealis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its resilience and ability to flourish in harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea borealis has basal leaves that are spoon-shaped (spathulate), arranged in a rosette, and have a grayish-blue color due to dense pubescence.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing from the base to form a flowering stalk. The flowers are compound umbels with yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to cold, dry environments, helping the plant survive in alpine and arctic regions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea borealis is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across northern areas such as Alaska, Canada, Scandinavia, and Siberia. This plant thrives in open, disturbed environments like tundra, rocky slopes, and coastal areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to around 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Achillea borealis is listed as a species of concern in some regions due to habitat loss and climate change impacts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea borealis is a hardy perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally pest and disease resistant but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or lavender can enhance its beauty and benefit from their shared preference for full sun and well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea borealis is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, which rely on its seeds and foliage for sustenance. This plant acts as a companion plant in alpine and rocky habitats, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its dense growth also offers shelter for small animals and insects.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea borealis contributes to the ecological balance by supporting biodiversity in its native environments.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea borealis is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions, known for its medicinal properties and traditional uses.</p>
<p>It has been historically used in herbal medicine to treat respiratory and digestive ailments due to its anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic compounds. In some cultures, it holds symbolic significance, often associated with protection and healing. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it may be used in local foraging practices.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems also contributes to its value in environmental conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea borealis has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental appeal and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aurea' with its golden foliage and 'Purpurea' known for its purple-tinged leaves. While few hybrids have been specifically developed for this species, some crosses with related achillea species have produced plants with enhanced color and vigor. These cultivars are widely used in gardens for their hardiness and ability to thrive in various soil conditions.</p>
<p>Their horticultural importance lies in their role as low-maintenance perennials that add visual interest to landscapes.</p>
