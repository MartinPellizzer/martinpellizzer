                    <h1>Aloe megalocarpa</h1>
<p>Aloe megalocarpa, commonly known as the giant aloe or mountain aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces large, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are often ribbed and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Aloe megalocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
