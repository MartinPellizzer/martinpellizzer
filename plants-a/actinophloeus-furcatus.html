                <h1>Actinophloeus furcatus</h1>
<p>Actinophloeus furcatus, commonly known as the forked bladder nut, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, bladder-like fruits that split open to release seeds. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a rough texture.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in moist, tropical environments and is valued for its ornamental features.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus furcatus has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with leaflets that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, and are typically dark green on the upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, vertical strips. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in panicles, bloom during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus furcatus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, often growing in shaded understorey conditions. It is also present in parts of southern China and the islands of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to these geographic regions, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus furcatus was mainly introduced to areas with high soil moisture and partial to full shade, typically found in riparian zones and moist forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with temperate climates and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands. This plant has been reported in several states across the southeastern United States, including Georgia, Florida, and Tennessee. Its introduction is believed to be due to both natural dispersal and human activities such as landscaping and erosion control.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems remains under study due to its relatively recent establishment.</p>
