                    <h1>Aurantium × acre</h1>
<p>Aurantium × acre, commonly known as the sour orange, is a hybrid citrus plant resulting from the cross between *Citrus aurantium* and *Citrus sinensis*.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, peely skin and a high concentration of citric acid, giving it a tart flavor. The plant typically grows as a small evergreen tree with glossy, dark green leaves. Its flowers are fragrant and white, often blooming in spring, followed by small, round fruits.</p>
<p>The sour orange is widely used in horticulture for its ornamental value and as a rootstock for other citrus varieties.</p>
