                        <h1>Acer caudatum var. erosum</h1>
<p>Acer caudatum var. erosum, commonly known as the red maple or scarlet maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red to orange-red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental species. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, appearing in clusters before the leaves in early spring.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the tree can reach heights of up to 20 meters.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer caudatum var. erosum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas of Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland edges. This variety is commonly found in the Appalachian Mountains region, where it grows as a small to medium-sized tree. It is often associated with wetland habitats and is well adapted to humid, subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and considered a sensitive indicator species for healthy riparian ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer caudatum var. erosum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive weeping habit and vibrant fall color. The plant is often found in urban and suburban landscapes, where it is used as a shade tree or ornamental specimen. However, it is not native to this region and has been introduced through horticultural practices.</p>
<p>Its presence in these areas has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
