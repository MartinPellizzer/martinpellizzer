                <h1>Acer auritum</h1>
<p>Acer auritum, commonly known as the earleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central America and northern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically lobed and have a distinctive ear-like appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a tendency to develop shallow fissures as the tree matures.</p>
<p>Acer auritum is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to subtropical climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer auritum has palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in diameter, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>The stems are smooth and reddish-brown, with a slender growth pattern that often forms a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and clustered in panicles, with yellowish-green petals, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind due to their light weight and wing-like structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer auritum is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of Mexico and has been introduced to other tropical regions. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical and subtropical forests. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and deforestation, Acer auritum is listed as a vulnerable species by the IUCN, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer auritum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant foliage and unique ear-like leaves.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or layering, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for germination. The growth cycle of Acer auritum is relatively slow, with mature trees reaching heights of up to 15 meters over several decades.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or leaf spot, making companion planting with herbs like lavender or marigold beneficial for natural pest control.</p>
