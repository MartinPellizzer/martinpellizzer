                <h1>Acer auritum</h1>
<p>Acer auritum, commonly known as the Mexican maple, is a deciduous tree native to central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is known for its showy, clustered flowers that appear in the spring. Its bark is smooth and gray, often developing shallow fissures with age.</p>
<p>Acer auritum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer auritum has palmately compound leaves that are opposite in arrangement, with five to seven lobes, each ending in a pointed tip, and they are typically 5-10 cm in length, displaying a bright green color in summer and turning yellow or red in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and smooth, with a light brown bark that peels off in thin strips, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a spreading growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in cymes, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer auritum is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Mexico, particularly in the states of Oaxaca, Veracruz, and Puebla.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Sierra Madre del Sur and the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. It thrives in humid, temperate environments with well-drained soils, typically found in cloud forests and montane forests. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, Acer auritum is listed as endangered by the IUCN, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer auritum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. The growth cycle of Acer auritum includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and early summer, with flowering in late spring.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigolds can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer auritum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil health and promoting the growth of other native species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer auritum contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality through its photosynthetic processes.</p>
