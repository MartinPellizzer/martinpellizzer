<p>Acer hayatae, commonly known as the Hayata maple, is a rare species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acer hayatae is considered an endangered species.</p>
