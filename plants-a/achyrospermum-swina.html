                <h1>Achyrospermum swina</h1>
<p>Achyrospermum swina, commonly known as the yellow starbursts, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy stems and lobed leaves. Its flowers, which range in color from yellow to orange, bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Achyrospermum swina is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum swina has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a pale green color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellow petals and a prominent central stamen, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum swina is primarily native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in open areas such as grasslands and disturbed sites. It is also known to occur in parts of Paraguay and Argentina.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes be found in cultivated areas near its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum swina was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the country in the early 20th century by horticulturists seeking to add exotic species to botanical gardens and private collections. Despite its initial popularity, it has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered an invasive species in several regions of the southeastern United States. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils have led to concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and prevent further ecological disruption.</p>
