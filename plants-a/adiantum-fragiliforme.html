                <h1>Adiantum fragiliforme</h1>
<p>Adiantum fragiliforme, commonly known as the brittle frond maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often described as fragile and translucent. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a unique structure that allows for efficient water retention.</p>
<p>Adiantum fragiliforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum fragiliforme has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically narrow, elongated, and have a pale green color, arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The plant produces spore-bearing structures rather than true flowers and fruits, and its roots are fibrous, helping it anchor to moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum fragiliforme is primarily native to Thailand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in forested areas and near water sources. This fern thrives in humid environments with partial shade, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its delicate fronds make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>The plant's distribution is closely linked to the moist, tropical climate of Thailand.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum fragiliforme was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as stream banks and forest floors. This fern is known for its delicate, lace-like fronds and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to spread into native habitats.</p>
<p>It is important to monitor its distribution to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
