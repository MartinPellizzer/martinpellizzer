                        <h1>Acacia pterocarpa</h1>
<p>Acacia pterocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, feather-like leaves and produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought resistance through its deep root system. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods, which split open to release the seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Acacia pterocarpa plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia pterocarpa is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry sclerophyll forests and woodlands. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or sandy habitats. It is well adapted to the semi-arid and arid climates of its native range.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which contributes to soil fertility in its ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia pterocarpa was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the northern and western parts of the country. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate harsh environmental conditions. Its introduction has also led to its use in reforestation and as a source of timber and fuelwood.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts on native flora and fauna.</p>
