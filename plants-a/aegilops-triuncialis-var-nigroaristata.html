<p>Aegilops triuncialis var. nigroaristata, commonly known as black-bristle wild wheat, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets with distinctive black bristles at the tips, which give it its common name. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
