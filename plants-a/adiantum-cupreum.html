<p>Adiantum cupreum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum cupreum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with a delicate, lacey appearance and a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and wiry with a smooth, grayish-brown bark.

<p>It is an important component of the local flora and is valued for its ornamental qualities.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum cupreum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, typically along stream banks and in forest understories.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures, making it common in temperate and subtropical climates. The plant is often found in rocky or calcareous soils, which provide the necessary nutrients for its growth. Its introduction has been documented in several regions outside its native range, including parts of North America and Europe.</p>
