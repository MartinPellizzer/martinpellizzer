                    <h1>Aristida barbicollis</h1>
<p>Aristida barbicollis, commonly known as the narrow-awn grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed or arid soils. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is often used in restoration projects and landscaping in arid regions.</p>
