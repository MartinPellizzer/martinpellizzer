                <h1>Achillea cretica</h1>
<p>Achillea cretica, commonly known as Cretan yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped umbels. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Achillea cretica is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea cretica has leaves that are lance-shaped, with a gray-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark, growing in a bushy pattern. Its flowers are flat-topped clusters (called a corymb) of small, white to pale yellow petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea cretica is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is now found in various parts of the world, particularly in temperate regions with suitable climates. This species thrives in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is commonly found in open habitats such as grasslands, shrublands, and coastal areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to around 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, Achillea cretica is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, though it may face local threats due to habitat loss and overgrazing.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea cretica is a hardy perennial plant known for its attractive yellow flowers and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing the roots in early spring. The growth cycle of Achillea cretica includes a period of active growth in spring, flowering in mid to late summer, and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogged roots. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its appearance and vigor. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot if conditions are too damp.</p>
<p>Companion planting with thyme or rosemary can enhance its growth and repel harmful pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea cretica is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts beneficial insects and birds, contributing to biodiversity in its ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its allelopathic properties. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system, stabilizing soil in arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea cretica offers shelter and food for small wildlife, playing a vital role in maintaining ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea cretica is a versatile plant with a range of uses and applications across various domains.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, it is sometimes used as a herb to flavor dishes, though its use is more traditional than widespread. Medicinally, it has been historically employed for its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties, though modern scientific validation is limited. Industrially, it contributes to the biodiversity of certain ecosystems, supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance.</p>
<p>Culturally, it has symbolic significance in some regions, often associated with healing and resilience.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
