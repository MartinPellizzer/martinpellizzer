                    <h1>Aechmea kertesziae var. viridiaurata</h1>
<p>Aechmea kertesziae var. viridiaurata, commonly known as the green-tipped aechmea, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with vibrant red bracts that contrast with its green foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens.</p>
