                    <h1>Acacia aneura var. argentea</h1>
<p>Acacia aneura var. argentea, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by long, flat pods. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Indigenous practices.</p>
