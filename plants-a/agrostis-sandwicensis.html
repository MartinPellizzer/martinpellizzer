                    <h1>Agrostis sandwicensis</h1>
<p>Agrostis sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in Hawaii.</p>
