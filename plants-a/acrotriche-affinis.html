                <h1>Acrotriche affinis</h1>
<p>Acrotriche affinis, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming annual or perennial herb that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Acrotriche affinis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotriche affinis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotriche affinis is primarily native to South Australia, Tasmania, and Victoria.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in coastal and sandy soils across these regions. It thrives in well-drained environments, often growing in open habitats such as dunes and sand plains. The plant is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotriche affinis was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern Australia, where it has become naturalized in disturbed sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is often found growing along dunes and in open vegetation types, thriving in areas with high salinity and poor soil nutrients. The plant is commonly associated with coastal habitats and is considered a weed in some parts of its range due to its rapid spread. It has been documented in several states, including South Australia, Western Australia, and Victoria.</p>
<p>Its introduction is believed to be through human activity, such as land clearing and transportation of contaminated soil.</p>
