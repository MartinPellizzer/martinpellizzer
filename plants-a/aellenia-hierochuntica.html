                <h1>Aellenia hierochuntica</h1>
<p>Aellenia hierochuntica, commonly known as the Cyprus starflower, is a rare and endangered plant native to Cyprus.</p>
<p>It is a small herbaceous species characterized by its star-shaped flowers and narrow, lanceolate leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to survive in harsh conditions. It blooms in the spring, producing bright yellow flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aellenia hierochuntica has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a glossy dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>
