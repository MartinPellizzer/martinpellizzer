                <h1>Actinidia cinerascens</h1>
<p>Actinidia cinerascens, commonly known as the silver vine, is a deciduous climbing shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Actinidiaceae family and is characterized by its finely hairy, grayish-green leaves that give it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, followed by edible berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its foliage is often used in traditional Chinese medicine, and it is also cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>The silver vine is valued for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia cinerascens has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with separate male and female flowers on different plants, blooming in early spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, round berry that turns red when ripe, containing multiple seeds, and it is dispersed by birds and mammals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, spreading horizontally near the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia cinerascens is primarily native to China, specifically the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>It grows in temperate regions at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This plant is commonly found in forests and shrublands, often along stream banks and in moist, shaded areas. It is part of the Actinidiaceae family and is known for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia cinerascens was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought in during the 19th century as part of botanical exploration and horticultural interest. The plant is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. It has become naturalized in some areas, spreading through both seed dispersal and vegetative growth.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and is often valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits.</p>
