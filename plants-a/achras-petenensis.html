                <h1>Achras petenensis</h1>
<p>Achras petenensis, commonly known as the kapok tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and large, palm-like leaves that can reach up to three meters in length. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by fluffy, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is thick and fibrous, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras petenensis has large, palmate leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern, and can reach up to 1 meter in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in a panicle, blooming during the dry season, and is pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a large, spiny capsule that contains numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals attracted to the fruit's scent and appearance.</p>
<p>The roots are extensive and fibrous, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and helping it survive in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras petenensis is a tropical plant native to Central America, specifically found in parts of Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas of northern South America, particularly in the Amazon Basin, where it has been introduced. It thrives in humid lowland forests and swampy areas, preferring wet, nutrient-rich soils. A. petenensis typically grows at altitudes below 300 meters, often near rivers or in seasonally flooded regions.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its habitat is threatened by deforestation and land conversion, raising concerns for its long-term survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras petenensis is a fast-growing, tropical plant known for its large, spiny leaves and edible fruits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings often yielding faster results. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, reaching maturity within a year under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain shape and encourage fruiting. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or mealybugs, which can be controlled with organic insecticides.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achras petenensis is a tropical plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds with its large, showy flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing biodiversity and soil health. Its dense foliage helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the ecological balance by supporting local fauna and promoting a healthy microclimate.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achras petenensis is a plant native to Central America, known for its large, fleshy fruits that are used in local cuisines for their sweet, juicy flavor.</p>
<p>Its fruit is also utilized in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and digestive properties. Industrially, the plant contributes to the economy through agroforestry practices and provides livelihoods for local communities. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some indigenous communities, representing abundance and fertility.</p>
<p>Overall, Achras petenensis plays a multifaceted role in both ecological and human systems.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
