                <h1>Achras petenensis</h1>
<p>Achras petenensis, commonly known as the wild date palm, is a tall, evergreen tree native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its large, pinnate leaves and smooth, gray bark. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, sweet fruits resembling dates. Its rapid growth and drought tolerance make it an important species in tropical ecosystems.</p>
<p>The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential economic use in agriculture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras petenensis has large, palmate leaves that are broadly lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing as a solitary trunk. The plant produces large, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a large, spiny capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, anchoring the plant and helping it access water in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras petenensis is primarily native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly Belize, Guatemala, and northern Honduras.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed sites. It is also present in parts of southern Mexico and the Yucatan Peninsula.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for specific ecological conditions, its distribution is relatively limited to these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras petenensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential economic uses.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with warm climates, including parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and Southeast Asia. The plant is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes due to its large, palm-like appearance and its ability to thrive in well-drained soil. It has also been introduced to some parts of the United States, particularly in Florida and Texas, where it is grown as a decorative plant.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
