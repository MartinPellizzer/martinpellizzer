                    <h1>Appendicula fallax</h1>
<p>Appendicula fallax, commonly known as the rock moss or rock liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Marchantiaceae and is characterized by its simple, lobed thallus that often forms dense mats on rocky surfaces. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its thallus for nutrient absorption. Appendicula fallax is typically found in temperate regions, growing on limestone or sandstone.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and unique morphology make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
