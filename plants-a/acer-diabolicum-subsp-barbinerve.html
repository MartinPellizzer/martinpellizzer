<p>Acer diabolicum subsp.</p>
<p>barbinerve, commonly known as the devil's maple, is a rare and striking member of the Acer genus native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely serrated leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its unique leaf structure, with barbed veins, sets it apart from other maple species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
