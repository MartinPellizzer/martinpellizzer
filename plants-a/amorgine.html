                    <h1>Amorgine</h1>
<p>Amorgine, commonly known as the "buttercup" or "false buttercup," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, often yellow or orange flowers with five petals and a distinctive central stigma. The leaves are typically palmately divided, with a smooth or hairy surface, and the stems are usually hairy as well. Amorgine species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>These plants are sometimes considered invasive in certain regions due to their rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes.</p>
