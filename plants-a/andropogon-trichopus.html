                    <h1>Andropogon trichopus</h1>
<p>Andropogon trichopus, commonly known as hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are typically arranged in compact clusters along the stem. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>Hairgrass is often found in marshy areas and is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding and high water tables.</p>
