                    <h1>Alnus acuminata var. spachii</h1>
<p>Alnus acuminata var. spachii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that appear in catkins. The plant is typically found in moist, temperate climates, often growing near water sources such as streams and wetlands. It has a shallow root system that can help stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats.</p>
