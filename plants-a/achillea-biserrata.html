                <h1>Achillea biserrata</h1>
<p>Achillea biserrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens. Its leaves are narrow and serrated, giving it a distinctive appearance, while its small white to pale yellow flowers bloom in summer.</p>
<p>Achillea biserrata is also valued for its medicinal properties, traditionally used to treat wounds and digestive issues.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea biserrata has leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length, typically with a gray-green to silver-white color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a pale green to brownish color, growing in a bushy manner with multiple branches. The flowers are composite, consisting of a central yellow disk surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, allowing wind dispersal, and the seeds are lightweight and carried by the wind to new locations.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, enabling the plant to spread vegetatively and establish dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea biserrata is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is now distributed across a range that includes southern Europe, the Canary Islands, and parts of North Africa. This species thrives in dry, rocky, and sandy soils, often growing in open habitats such as coastal dunes, grasslands, and scrublands. It is typically found at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, Achillea biserrata is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, although its populations are considered somewhat localized and may be vulnerable to habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea biserrata is a hardy perennial plant known for its feathery foliage and clusters of yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rootstock or by sowing seeds in the spring. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in the summer months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning after flowering help maintain its health and appearance. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
