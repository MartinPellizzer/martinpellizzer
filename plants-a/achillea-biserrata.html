                <h1>Achillea biserrata</h1>
<p>Achillea biserrata, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitats. Achillea biserrata is a perennial herb that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine is attributed to its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea biserrata has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a serrated margin, and are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically green, with a slightly hairy surface, and vary in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length. The stem is erect, somewhat hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark, growing in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, and form dense flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small achene, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous, aiding in the plant's anchorage and nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea biserrata is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of India.</p>
<p>It is now found in various parts of the world, including Europe and North America, where it has been introduced as an ornamental plant. This species thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is commonly found in alpine meadows and dry grasslands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 4,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited native range and habitat specificity, Achillea biserrata is considered to be of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea biserrata is a perennial plant known for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rhizomes or by sowing seeds in early spring. The growth cycle of Achillea biserrata involves a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring can promote healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in damp conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea biserrata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also attracts other wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for stabilizing slopes and preventing land degradation.</p>
<p>Achillea biserrata also contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and supporting biodiversity in its habitat.</p>
