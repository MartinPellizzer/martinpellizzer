                        <h1>Acacia tristis</h1>
<p>Acacia tristis, commonly known as the black wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thorned branches and bipinnate leaves that are narrow and linear. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. Acacia tristis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought.</p>
<p>It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia tristis is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the states of Queensland, New South Wales, and South Australia. This species thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open woodlands and scrublands. It is well adapted to the hot, dry climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Acacia tristis is also known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is sometimes used in traditional Aboriginal practices.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia tristis was mainly introduced to areas with dry climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental or for its hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Australia, parts of Southeast Asia, and some areas of the Mediterranean. The plant's introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in certain ecosystems. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>However, its spread can pose challenges to native plant species in non-native environments.</p>
