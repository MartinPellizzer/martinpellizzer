                    <h1>Archivea</h1>
<p>Archivea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the orchid family, native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers and its unique ability to thrive without soil, relying instead on symbiotic relationships with specific fungi. The plant's roots are highly specialized, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the air and water. Archivea is often found growing on the trunks of trees in wetland areas, where it benefits from high humidity and indirect light.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
