<p>Alchemilla keniensis f. subuniloba, commonly known as the Kenyan lady's mantle, is a rare and unique variant of the lady's mantle genus.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of Kenya, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in panicles, typically blooming in late spring.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its limited distribution and distinct morphological characteristics.</p>
