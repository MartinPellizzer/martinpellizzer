                    <h1>Avena strigosa subvar. deserticola</h1>
<p>Avena strigosa subvar. deserticola, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the grass family. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
