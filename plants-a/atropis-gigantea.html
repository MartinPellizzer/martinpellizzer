                    <h1>Atropis gigantea</h1>
<p>Atropis gigantea, commonly known as the giant spider lily, is a striking plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, white, bell-shaped flowers that emit a strong, unpleasant odor, attracting specific pollinators like flies. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that grow from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread aggressively in moist environments. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires consistently wet soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a problematic species in certain regions.</p>
