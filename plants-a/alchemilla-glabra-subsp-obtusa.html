<p>Alchemilla glabra subsp.</p>
<p>obtusa, commonly known as narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features silver-green, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>

<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and naturalized landscapes.</p>
