<p>Asplenium sessilifolium var. guatemalense, commonly known as the Guatemalan shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and horticultural collections.</p>
