                <h1>Actinea richardsonii</h1>
<p>Actinea richardsonii, commonly known as the Richardson's actinia, is a species of sea anemone found in the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent tentacles and a short, fleshy stem. This marine organism thrives in intertidal zones, often attaching itself to rocks or other substrates. Its coloration can vary, typically ranging from pale pink to orange, depending on environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Actinea richardsonii plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various small aquatic organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinea richardsonii has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and typically measure around 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a somewhat branched pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, featuring a simple structure with five petals, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea richardsonii is primarily native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, specifically Washington and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks. This plant thrives in areas with cool, humid climates and well-drained soil. It is often associated with coniferous forests and is a characteristic species of the Pacific coastal temperate rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and localized within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea richardsonii was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the United States and Canada, as a decorative plant for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>It was popular in gardens and landscapes due to its unique, fern-like appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments. However, its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain regions. The plant's rapid growth and competitive nature have raised questions about its ecological impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, its spread has been monitored to prevent unintended environmental consequences.</p>
