It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
<p>Acalypha macafeeana is also noted for its ability to grow in a variety of soil types, making it a versatile choice for landscaping.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha macafeeana is primarily native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii.</p>
<p>It is found in the wetter, more humid regions of the Hawaiian archipelago. This plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, often in disturbed or open habitats. It is commonly associated with coastal dunes and rocky shores.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Hawaii.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha macafeeana was mainly introduced to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The plant has since become naturalized in certain areas, particularly in disturbed habitats and along roadsides. Despite its aesthetic value, it has raised concerns due to its potential to spread aggressively.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological impacts of non-native species in island ecosystems.</p>
