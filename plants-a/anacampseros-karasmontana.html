                    <h1>Anacampseros karasmontana</h1>
<p>Anacampseros karasmontana, commonly known as the Karasman's ice plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
