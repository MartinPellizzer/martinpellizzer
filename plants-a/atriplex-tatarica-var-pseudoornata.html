                    <h1>Atriplex tatarica var. pseudoornata</h1>
<p>Atriplex tatarica var. pseudoornata, commonly known as shadscale, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability.</p>
<p>This species is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
