<p>Atraphaxis dioica, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in harsh, dry environments, showcasing adaptations such as small, thick leaves to minimize water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its seed pods are woody and split open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Atraphaxis dioica is valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
