                <h1>Acidocroton oligostemon</h1>
<p>Acidocroton oligostemon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidocroton oligostemon has alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is woody and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green, with five petals and a short corolla, blooming during the wet season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidocroton oligostemon is primarily native to Cuba.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the island, particularly in humid lowland forests. This plant thrives in areas with high rainfall and warm temperatures. It is commonly associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to Cuba, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidocroton oligostemon was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become naturalized in various regions across the country. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in forested areas and along stream banks. Despite its ornamental appeal, it has the potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now well established in several parts of New Zealand, with ongoing monitoring to assess its ecological impact.</p>
