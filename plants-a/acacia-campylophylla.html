                    <h1>Acacia campylophylla</h1>
<p>Acacia campylophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often drooping phyllodes that are typically green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late summer, which are arranged in compact clusters. Acacia campylophylla is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various native animals.</p>
