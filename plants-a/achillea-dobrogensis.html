<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea dobrogensis is a rare flowering plant native to the Dobruja region, which spans parts of northeastern Romania and southwestern Ukraine.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in this area. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, often in areas with poor soil. This species is typically found at altitudes between 100 and 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Achillea dobrogensis is considered critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts to prevent its extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
