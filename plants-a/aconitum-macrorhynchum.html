                <h1>Aconitum macrorhynchum</h1>
<p>Aconitum macrorhynchum, commonly known as the large-rooted monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, which are typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in areas accessible to children or pets.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum macrorhynchum has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, reaching up to 20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and greenish-brown in color, with a straight growth pattern and a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with a spurred shape, and bloom in late summer; they are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, adapted for absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum macrorhynchum is primarily native to Amur, Buryatiya, Chita, Inner Mongolia, Khabarovsk, Korea, Manchuria, Mongolia, Primorye, Yakutiya.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with forested or rocky habitats. Aconitum macrorhynchum is well-adapted to the cold and humid conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution spans across parts of East Asia, including both Siberian and Korean regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum macrorhynchum was mainly introduced to North America through human activities such as horticultural trade and intentional planting.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This plant has become naturalized in several regions, often outcompeting native species due to its aggressive growth habit. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to invade native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered invasive in many areas where it has established itself.</p>
