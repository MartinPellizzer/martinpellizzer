<p>Aconitum macrorhynchum, commonly known as the large-rooted monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, which are typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in areas accessible to children or pets.</p>
