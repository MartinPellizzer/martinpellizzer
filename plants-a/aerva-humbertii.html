                    <h1>Aerva humbertii</h1>
<p>Aerva humbertii, commonly known as the African sandbur, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and adapted to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spiny burrs that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing. It has fibrous roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Aerva humbertii is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its native environment.</p>
