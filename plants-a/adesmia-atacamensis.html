<p>Adesmia atacamensis, commonly known as the Atacama burro's tail, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of northern Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its desert habitat. Its leaves are reduced to small scales, a feature that helps minimize water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Adesmia atacamensis is adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in the Atacama Desert.</p>
