                <h1>Adenocalymma ubatubense</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma ubatubense, commonly known as the Ubatuba adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its flowers are typically pink or red, clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma ubatubense has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and has a light brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in nutrient-rich soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma ubatubense is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal regions of the state of Esp√≠rito Santo. This plant typically grows in sandy soils along the Atlantic coast. It is adapted to the tropical climate and is often seen in dry forest environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within the Southeast region of Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma ubatubense was mainly introduced to the region of Ubatuba, Brazil, as part of ecological restoration efforts.</p>
<p>It was distributed in areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial shade, typically along riverbanks and in forest edges. The plant was introduced to enhance biodiversity and stabilize soil in degraded habitats. Its introduction has been carefully monitored to prevent potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>It is now considered an important component of local reforestation initiatives.</p>
