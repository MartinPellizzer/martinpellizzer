                        <h1>Acacia deflexa</h1>
<p>Acacia deflexa, commonly known as the dwarf silver wattle, is a small shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads, which appear in late winter to early spring. Acacia deflexa is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions.</p>
<p>It is a valuable plant for soil stabilization and provides nectar for native pollinators.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia deflexa belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse morphological features.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of plants that typically have compound leaves and flowers with specialized structures for pollination. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume family, characterized by pods and nitrogen-fixing abilities through symbiotic bacteria. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive foliage and often used in traditional medicine and land restoration.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia deflexa, a specific type of acacia found in certain regions, recognized by its unique growth form and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia deflexa is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southern and western regions of the state. This species typically grows in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland habitats. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid environments of the region.</p>
<p>Acacia deflexa plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is part of the diverse flora of Western Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia deflexa was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in dry or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. This plant has a spreading habit and produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and soil stabilization properties.</p>
