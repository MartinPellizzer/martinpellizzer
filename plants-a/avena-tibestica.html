                    <h1>Avena tibestica</h1>
<p>Avena tibestica, commonly known as the Tibesti oat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Tibesti Mountains in Chad.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that thrives in harsh, semi-desert conditions, exhibiting adaptations such as deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize rocky and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Avena tibestica plays a minor role in local ecosystems, providing limited forage for wildlife and contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat.</p>
