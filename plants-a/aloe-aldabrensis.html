                    <h1>Aloe aldabrensis</h1>
<p>Aloe aldabrensis, commonly known as the Aldabra aloe, is a succulent plant native to the Aldabra Atoll in the Seychelles.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow flowers, which bloom during the dry season. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves for survival.</p>
<p>Aloe aldabrensis is also valued for its medicinal properties, though it is not as widely used as other aloe species.</p>
