                <h1>Acrostichum sinense</h1>
<p>Acrostichum sinense, commonly known as the Chinese fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The fronds are also sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their attractive appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum sinense has large, pinnately compound leaves that are broad and leathery in texture, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and somewhat fibrous, with a smooth, light brown bark. The plant produces inconspicuous, small greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are lightweight and adapted for aerial transport.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum sinense is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, India, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found near coastal areas and in wetlands. This plant is commonly associated with mangrove ecosystems and can be found in brackish water environments. It is also present in parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends across several islands in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum sinense was mainly introduced to coastal and estuarine areas where it thrives in brackish water conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mangrove ecosystems and tidal flats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. This plant is well adapted to fluctuating salinity levels and can tolerate periodic flooding. Its introduction has been documented in several regions with similar environmental conditions.</p>
<p>It is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and resilience.</p>
