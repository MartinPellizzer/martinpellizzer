<p>Apargia proteiformis, commonly known as the variable apargia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typically blooming in late spring. Apargia proteiformis thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
