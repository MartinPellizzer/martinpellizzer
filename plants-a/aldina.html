<p>Aldina, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are native to the tropical regions of Africa and South America. The plants are characterized by their large, showy inflorescences that consist of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe. Aldina species typically grow in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories.</p>
<p>They are often mistaken for true hellebores due to their similar appearance, but they belong to different plant families.</p>
