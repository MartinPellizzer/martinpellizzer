                <h1>Acronema alpinum</h1>
<p>Acronema alpinum, commonly known as the alpine acronema, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, and are usually pale green or white in color.</p>
<p>Acronema alpinum is known for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects in alpine ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronema alpinum has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, erect, and slightly hairy, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. It produces tiny white or greenish flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are shallow and fibrous, helping it anchor in rocky or alpine soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema alpinum is primarily native to Tibet.</p>
<p>It is found in the high-altitude regions of this region, typically in alpine meadows and rocky areas. The plant thrives in cold and arid environments typical of the Tibetan Plateau. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Acronema alpinum is an important component of the local flora in Tibet.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema alpinum was mainly introduced to alpine and subalpine regions where it thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is typically found in rocky soils and open slopes, often in mountainous areas. This plant is known for its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white flowers. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited by climatic conditions and the availability of suitable habitats.</p>
