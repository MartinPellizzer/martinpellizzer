                    <h1>Acacia debilis</h1>
<p>Acacia debilis, commonly known as the slender acacia, is a small, thorny shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain edible seeds, which are used as food by both humans and animals.</p>
<p>Acacia debilis is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots that help it access groundwater and reduce water loss through its small, thick leaves.</p>
