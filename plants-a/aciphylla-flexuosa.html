<p>Aciphylla flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible spinifex, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features wiry, spiny stems covered in small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. It thrives in arid and coastal environments, often found on sand dunes and rocky shores.</p>
<p>Aciphylla flexuosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciphylla flexuosa has a rosette-forming structure with silver-gray, woolly leaves that are narrow, linear, and arranged in a tight spiral.</p>
<p>The stems are short and thick, with a rough, bark-like texture and a reddish-brown color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during late winter to early spring, relying on wind pollination.
