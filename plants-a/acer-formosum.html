                <h1>Acer formosum</h1>
<p>Acer formosum, commonly known as the Taiwan maple, is a deciduous tree native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds known as samaras. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and prefers well-drained soil in temperate climates.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer formosum has alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath, with a serrated edge, reaching up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers as the tree matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer formosum is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, specifically China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>While it was once found in the wild, its current distribution is largely confined to cultivation due to habitat loss and overharvesting. It thrives in temperate climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils in forests or along stream banks. This species typically occurs at altitudes between 500 and 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from deforestation, Acer formosum is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer formosum is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant red autumn foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer formosum is a valuable tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape and improving water retention.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer formosum plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by offering habitat and resources throughout different stages of its life cycle.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer formosum is a species of maple tree native to eastern Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While its berries are not commonly used in culinary applications, the tree provides habitat and food for various wildlife species. In traditional medicine, parts of the tree have been used to treat ailments such as inflammation and skin conditions. Industrially, its wood is valued for its durability and is used in furniture and construction.</p>
<p>Culturally, the tree symbolizes resilience and beauty, often featured in art and literature.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer formosum has a variety of cultivars that showcase its ornamental value, including 'Cunninghamii' and 'Gumpo', which are prized for their striking foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It is also involved in several hybrids, such as with Acer pensylvanicum, producing offspring that combine the best traits of both parents. These hybrids often exhibit enhanced hardiness and color variation, making them popular in horticultural collections. The plant's cultivars and hybrids are highly valued for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to different garden conditions.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer formosum plays a significant role in ornamental horticulture due to its visual diversity and resilience.</p>
