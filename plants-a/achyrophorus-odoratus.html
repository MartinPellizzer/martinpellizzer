                <h1>Achyrophorus odoratus</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus odoratus, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spike-like clusters. The plant is characterized by its aromatic rhizomes, which are used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. It thrives in muddy or aquatic environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its adaptability to wet conditions and its historical use in herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus odoratus has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing in a creeping or upright manner depending on the environment. Its flowers are small, greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters, and have a simple structure with separate male and female parts, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus odoratus is primarily native to the eastern United States, including states such as Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, wooded areas and along stream banks. This plant thrives in rich, sandy soils and is often associated with riparian habitats. It is also occasionally found in the southeastern regions of Canada.</p>
<p>Its native range extends from the Appalachian Mountains to the coastal plain of the southeastern U.S.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus odoratus was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought in during the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas into natural habitats, particularly in moist, shaded environments. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>However, it is currently considered to have a low ecological risk in the region.</p>
