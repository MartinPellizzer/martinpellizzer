<p>Aechmea nudicaulis var. sulcata, commonly known as the zigzag bromeliad, is a compact, low-growing bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are narrow and have a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with bright red flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
