                <h1>Adiantum decoratum</h1>
<p>Adiantum decoratum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that produce new shoots.</p>
<p>Adiantum decoratum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum decoratum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with finely divided, linear to lanceolate fronds that are typically 30-60 cm long.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green, glossy, and arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender, upright, and covered with a smooth, light brown bark. This plant does not produce flowers, as it is a fern and reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Its fruit is not applicable, as it does not produce fruits; instead, it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing water and nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum decoratum is primarily native to Belize, Brazil North, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Southeast, Nicaragua, and Panam√°.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. The plant is often seen growing along riverbanks and in humid lowland areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its preference for warm, humid climates with high rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum decoratum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. This fern is often associated with disturbed habitats and can spread rapidly in areas with high moisture levels. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is important to monitor its distribution to assess its impact on native plant communities.</p>
