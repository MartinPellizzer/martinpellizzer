<p>Acaena valida, commonly known as New Zealand thistle, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, bristly leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant produces small, achene fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in natural habitats. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>Acaena valida is often found in coastal and subalpine regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena valida is primarily native to southern South America, including Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in temperate regions, particularly in the Andes mountain range. This plant thrives in dry to moist soils and is often associated with shrublands and grasslands. It is well adapted to the climate and environmental conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Acaena valida plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena valida was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century as an ornamental plant. The species has since naturalized and is now commonly found in various habitats across the country. It is often seen in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and forest margins.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and has not displaced native vegetation significantly.</p>
