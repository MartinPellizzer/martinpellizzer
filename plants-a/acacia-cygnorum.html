                        <h1>Acacia cygnorum</h1>
<p>Acacia cygnorum, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow globular flowerheads that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry forests. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Acacia cygnorum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia cygnorum is primarily native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is commonly found in savanna and shrubland habitats. This species is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native range, with its woody structure and water-storing capabilities. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Acacia cygnorum is also known for its distinctive yellow flowers, which bloom during the rainy season.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia cygnorum was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with poor soil quality and is often used in reclamation projects. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it suitable for rehabilitation of disturbed lands. Its deep root system helps improve soil structure and water retention.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it has become an important species in ecological restoration efforts across several regions.</p>
