<p>Aspidium polylepis, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that are often divided into multiple pinnae, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Aspidium polylepis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
