                        <h1>Aberemoa lanceolata var. parvifolia</h1>
<p>Aberemoa lanceolata var. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf aberemoa, is a flowering plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aberemoa lanceolata var. parvifolia is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically from North Carolina to Florida.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, sandy soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. This variety thrives in coastal dune environments and is often associated with maritime hammocks. It is an important component of the plant communities in these regions.</p>
<p>However, its distribution is limited and it is not widely found beyond these specific areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aberemoa lanceolata var. parvifolia was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal regions and disturbed sites such as roadsides and abandoned fields. This plant has become naturalized in several states along the southeastern United States. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its spread beyond its original introduction range.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species that may compete with native vegetation in certain ecosystems.</p>
