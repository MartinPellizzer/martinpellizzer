                    <h1>Acacia binervia</h1>
<p>Acacia binervia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a small, spindly shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and bipinnate leaves, which are finely divided into small, needle-like leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Acacia binervia is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems and a capacity for resprouting after fire or drought.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
