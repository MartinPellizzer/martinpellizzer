<p>Alsophila lepidophora, commonly known as the golden tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a layer of dead, papery fronds that give it a distinctive golden appearance. The plant produces large, shield-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the trunk. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fertile fronds.</p>
<p>Alsophila lepidophora thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
