                    <h1>Anthemis brachystephana</h1>
<p>Anthemis brachystephana, commonly known as the narrow-stephane everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and it is known for its aromatic, often fragrant foliage. Anthemis brachystephana is a low-growing perennial that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine has also been noted, though its primary botanical interest lies in its floral structure and adaptability to arid environments.</p>
