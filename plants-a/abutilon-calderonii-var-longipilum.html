<p>It is found in the states of Oaxaca, Puebla, and Veracruz. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity. It typically grows in forested areas and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its natural range is limited to specific ecological zones within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon calderonii var. longipilum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive fuzzy leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions of the Hawaiian archipelago, including Oahu, Maui, and Kauai, where it has established populations in disturbed habitats.
