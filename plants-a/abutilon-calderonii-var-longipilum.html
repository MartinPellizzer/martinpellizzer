                <h1>Abutilon calderonii var. longipilum</h1>
<p>Abutilon calderonii var. longipilum, commonly known as the long-hair abutilon, is a shrub native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features palmate leaves with long, silky hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage and vibrant blooms make it a standout in both garden and container settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon calderonii var. longipilum has ovate to lanceolate leaves that are hairy, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with fine, soft hairs, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age, growing in a bushy pattern. The flowers are bell-shaped, with five lobes, typically pale yellow to greenish-white, blooming from spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon calderonii var. longipilum is a rare shrub native to the cloud forests of central Mexico, specifically in the states of Hidalgo and San Luis Potos√≠.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations within its native range, where it grows in humid, shaded understory conditions. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils at altitudes between 1,200 and 2,000 meters. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered endangered, with its limited population making it highly vulnerable to extinction.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve this unique species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon calderonii var. longipilum is a striking ornamental plant known for its velvety leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant has an annual growth cycle, thriving in warm climates and blooming during the summer months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions that can lead to root rot. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to encourage bushiness are essential for optimal growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Abutilon calderonii var. longipilum is a flowering plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its vibrant flowers, contributing to ecosystem pollination. This plant also acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of neighboring species by improving soil conditions. Additionally, it helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Its presence enhances biodiversity and supports a healthy ecological balance in its native habitat.</p>
