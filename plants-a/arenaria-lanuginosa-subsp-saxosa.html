<p>Arenaria lanuginosa subsp.</p>
<p>saxosa, commonly known as the saxose mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August.</p>
<p>The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>Its subspecies designation reflects its adaptation to more rugged, saxic (rocky) habitats compared to the typical form of Arenaria lanuginosa.</p>
