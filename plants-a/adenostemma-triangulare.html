                <h1>Adenostemma triangulare</h1>
<p>Adenostemma triangulare, commonly known as the triangular adenostemma, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1â€“3 meters, characterized by its opposite, lanceolate leaves and showy yellow or orange flowers. The plant produces small, three-lobed fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and cleared areas.</p>
<p>Adenostemma triangulare is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other parts of the world for horticultural purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma triangulare has simple, alternate leaves that are triangular in shape, with a smooth surface, varying in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, and typically have a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a rough, woody bark that is usually a reddish-brown color, and it grows in a bushy, branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with a tubular shape and a color ranging from pink to red, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to absorb nutrients efficiently from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma triangulare is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands, savannas, and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in regions with a warm, temperate climate and well-drained soils. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in both coastal and inland areas.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into parts of eastern and southern Africa, where it is an important component of the local flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma triangulare was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in California, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivation and is now considered an invasive species in several regions, outcompeting native plants in disturbed habitats. The plant's rapid growth and ability to establish dense stands make it a significant ecological threat. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found along roadsides, in pastures, and in other disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Control measures are necessary to prevent its further spread and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
