                <h1>Acilepis pulneyensis</h1>
<p>Acilepis pulneyensis, commonly known as the pulney's acilepis, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and threatened species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis pulneyensis has compound leaves that are pinnate, with lanceolate leaflets arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically green, with a slightly rough texture and measure approximately 5â€“10 cm in length. The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis pulneyensis is primarily native to India.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of the country, particularly in the states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth. It is often associated with humid climates and is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within India, making it a relatively rare species in the wild.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis pulneyensis was mainly introduced to areas with specific climatic conditions that mimic its native habitat.</p>
<p>It is typically found in regions with moderate temperatures and well-drained soils. The plant has been introduced to several locations outside its native range for ornamental or ecological purposes. However, its spread has been limited due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
<p>Its introduction has not resulted in significant ecological impacts in the regions where it has been established.</p>
