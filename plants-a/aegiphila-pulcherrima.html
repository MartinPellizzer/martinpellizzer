                <h1>Aegiphila pulcherrima</h1>
<p>Aegiphila pulcherrima, commonly known as the Brazilian mint or sweet pepper plant, is a shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs. The plant is characterized by its fragrant, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. It is often grown for its ornamental value and its use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila pulcherrima has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring tubular corollas with purple and white hues, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>
