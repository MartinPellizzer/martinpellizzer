                    <h1>Arenaria spathulata</h1>
<p>Arenaria spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it conserve moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer, which are often borne on slender, branching stems. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in loose, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Arenaria spathulata is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
