<p>Acinodendron theaezans is often grown for its ornamental value and unique blooming behavior.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron theaezans has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with ovate to elliptical leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, measuring approximately 2-5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures.
