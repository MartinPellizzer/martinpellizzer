                <h1>Achras euphlebia</h1>
<p>Achras euphlebia, commonly known as the desert date tree, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a thick, trunk-like stem covered in a fibrous, spongy layer. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fruit that resembles a large, spiky coconut. Its leaves are palmate, with five to seven lobes, and it has a deep root system adapted to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras euphlebia has leaves that are typically large, palmate, and lobed, with a deep green color and a velvety texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grayish-brown in color. Its flowers are large, showy, and clustered in umbels, with a yellowish-green color and a sweet fragrance, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, anchoring the plant and helping it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras euphlebia is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including parts of Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland regions where it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. This plant is often associated with mangrove ecosystems and is adapted to brackish water conditions. It plays an important role in the local biodiversity and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, its distribution is limited to specific habitats within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras euphlebia was mainly introduced to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its large, palm-like appearance. It has also been introduced to some regions of the United States, including Florida and Hawaii.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited compared to other introduced species in these areas.</p>
