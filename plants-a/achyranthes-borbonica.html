                <h1>Achyranthes borbonica</h1>
<p>Achyranthes borbonica, commonly known as the Bitter Panicgrass, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and feathery inflorescences. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Achyranthes borbonica is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes borbonica has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are typically 2-5 cm in length, dark green on top, and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in racemes, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes borbonica is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of southern Asia, including India and Sri Lanka, due to human introduction. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth and along stream banks. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Achyranthes borbonica is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, indicating it is not at immediate risk of extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
