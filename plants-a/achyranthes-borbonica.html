                <h1>Achyranthes borbonica</h1>
<p>Achyranthes borbonica, commonly known as the Indian knotgrass, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive, bead-like fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. Its roots are rich in compounds that have been studied for their potential health benefits.</p>
<p>Achyranthes borbonica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes borbonica has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 5–15 cm long and 2–5 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with greenish-white petals and stamens, blooming from June to September, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged schizocarp, dispersing by wind due to its light, feathery seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the soil and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes borbonica is primarily native to Réunion.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant species found in the flora of this island, which is part of the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, commonly growing in moist, shaded areas within forest ecosystems. It is often found in the undergrowth of native vegetation, contributing to the biodiversity of the region.</p>
<p>Due to its native habitat, it is not commonly cultivated outside of Réunion.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes borbonica was mainly introduced to new environments for its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along stream banks. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it adaptable to a variety of soil types. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds contribute to its invasive potential in non-native regions.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in certain ecological contexts.</p>
