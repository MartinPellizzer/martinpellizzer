                    <h1>Atriplex angustifolia var. erecta</h1>
<p>Atriplex angustifolia var. erecta, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of salt-secreting glands. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common pioneer species in disturbed or degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Its succulent leaves and ability to tolerate drought contribute to its ecological importance in desert ecosystems.</p>
