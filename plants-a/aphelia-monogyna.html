                    <h1>Aphelia monogyna</h1>
<p>Aphelia monogyna, commonly known as the single-stemmed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, unbranched stem and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. This plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Aphelia monogyna is a carnivorous plant, using its bladder-like organs to capture and digest prey.</p>
<p>Its presence often indicates a healthy, nutrient-poor aquatic ecosystem.</p>
