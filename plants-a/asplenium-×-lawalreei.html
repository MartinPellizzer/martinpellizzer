                    <h1>Asplenium × lawalreei</h1>
<p>Asplenium × lawalreei, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often deeply divided and covered in small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its foliage is usually dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Asplenium × lawalreei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.</p>
