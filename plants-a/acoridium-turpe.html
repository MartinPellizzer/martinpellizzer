                <h1>Acoridium turpe</h1>
<p>Acoridium turpe, commonly known as the swamp lily, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acoraceae and is characterized by its arrowhead-shaped leaves and showy, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine. Acoridium turpe has a short flowering period, usually during the rainy season, and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoridium turpe has leaves that are broad and lance-shaped, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in moist, shady habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium turpe is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments like forests and wetlands. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, making it a characteristic species of lowland and hill forest areas. It is also occasionally reported in parts of the Philippines and southern China.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium turpe was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant competes with indigenous species for resources, leading to ecological concerns.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
