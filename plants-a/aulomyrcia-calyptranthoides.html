                    <h1>Aulomyrcia calyptranthoides</h1>
<p>Aulomyrcia calyptranthoides, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a basal rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse seeds by wind. Its succulent leaves and drought-tolerant nature make it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>Aulomyrcia calyptranthoides plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
