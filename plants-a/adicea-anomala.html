                <h1>Adicea anomala</h1>
<p>Adicea anomala, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, often found on trees or rocks in humid environments. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and emit a strong, pleasant scent.</p>
<p>Adicea anomala is prized for its ornamental value and is widely cultivated as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea anomala has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly woody with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from April to June, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea anomala is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland areas and along riverbanks. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of the Arabian Peninsula and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>Adicea anomala plays an important ecological role in these regions, supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea anomala was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread across various regions of the country. This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and on disturbed sites such as roadsides and farmland. It is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now widespread, posing a threat to local ecosystems.</p>
