                    <h1>Aloe echinata</h1>
<p>Aloe echinata, commonly known as the spiny aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in sharp, spiny projections, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow or orange flowers, typically blooming in late summer. Its roots are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Aloe echinata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
