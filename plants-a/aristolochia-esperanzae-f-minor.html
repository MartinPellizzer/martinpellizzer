<p>Aristolochia esperanzae f. minor, commonly known as the Esperanza Minor Dutchman's Pipe, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that resemble pipes. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and emits a mild, sweet fragrance.
