                <h1>Acer erianthum</h1>
<p>Acer erianthum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red to orange foliage in the autumn, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has opposite, palmate leaves that are typically five to nine lobes, with a rough, hairy texture on the underside. It produces small, red flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer erianthum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 4 to 8 inches in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes furrowed with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, acidic soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer erianthum is a rare and critically endangered species of maple native to the eastern United States, specifically found in parts of Tennessee and North Carolina.</p>
<p>While its native range was once broader, its current distribution is severely restricted, with only a few known populations remaining. It thrives in moist, rich hardwood forests, often growing in shaded, well-drained soils. This species is typically found at low to mid-elevation areas, generally below 600 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Acer erianthum is listed as critically endangered, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer erianthum is a small deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and relatively easy cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer erianthum includes a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and health are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving perennials or groundcovers can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer erianthum is a small, flowering tree that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also offers shelter and nesting sites for various birds and small mammals, contributing to local biodiversity. Its dense root system acts as an effective erosion control plant, stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas. Additionally, it can act as a companion plant in woodland ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer erianthum plays a crucial ecological role in maintaining habitat and promoting environmental health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer erianthum is a small deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and flowers may have minor uses in traditional herbal remedies. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to biodiversity and supports local wildlife, though it lacks significant commercial value. Culturally, it is appreciated for its aesthetic appeal in landscaping and gardens.</p>
<p>Symbolically, it represents the natural beauty and resilience of native flora in North America.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer erianthum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Autumn Flame' and 'Orange Queen,' which are known for their vibrant fall colors. Hybrid forms have been developed to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and foliage color. These plants hold horticultural importance due to their adaptability and aesthetic appeal in gardens.</p>
<p>Their unique characteristics make them a desirable choice for landscape design.</p>
