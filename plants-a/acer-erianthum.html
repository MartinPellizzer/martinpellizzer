                <h1>Acer erianthum</h1>
<p>Acer erianthum, commonly known as the silver maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are pale beneath and have a silvery sheen. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its roots are shallow and fibrous, making it adaptable to various soil types.</p>
<p>The silver maple is often found near streams and in moist woodlands, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer erianthum has alternate, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, typically measuring 3-7 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are bright green during the growing season and turn yellow in autumn. The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, clustered yellow-green flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer erianthum is a small deciduous tree native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of western North America, though it is less common today due to habitat loss. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and riparian areas. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 600 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat degradation, Acer erianthum is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer erianthum is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, which require cold stratification, or by grafting for better control over its characteristics. The growth cycle of Acer erianthum includes a period of rapid growth in spring, followed by a rest period in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot, and it pairs well with flowering shrubs and perennials in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer erianthum is a small, deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its shallow root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and offering habitat for insects and other small animals.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer erianthum is a small deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its fruits can be consumed in moderation. In traditional medicine, it has been used by Native American tribes for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and provides habitat for wildlife, supporting local ecosystems.</p>
