                    <h1>Agrostis vulgaris var. vivipara</h1>
<p>Agrostis vulgaris var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. One of its distinguishing features is the presence of vivipary, where seeds germinate while still attached to the mother plant. This variant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ecological significance lies in its role as a pioneer species in disturbed habitats and its potential use in ecological restoration projects.</p>
