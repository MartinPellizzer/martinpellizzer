<p>It is characterized by its grey-green, narrow leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia gunnii var. hirsutior has compound leaves that are bipinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets arranged in pairs along a central axis, giving the foliage a feathery appearance; the leaves are usually light green and vary in size depending on environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically pale grey to brown in color, and it grows in a spreading, shrub-like form. The flowers are yellow and occur in dense, globular clusters, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a flattened, woody pod that contains several elongated seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their small size and light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the plant to access water from deeper soil layers, especially in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia gunnii var. hirsutior is a shrub native to the eastern and southeastern regions of Australia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of New South Wales and Victoria, where it has been introduced and sometimes naturalized. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and heathlands. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered a species of concern and is listed as vulnerable in some conservation assessments.</p>
