<p>Antennaria neodioica, commonly known as the northern sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Antennaria neodioica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
