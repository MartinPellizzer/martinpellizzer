                <h1>Achimenes comifera</h1>
<p>Achimenes comifera, commonly known as the woolly achimenes, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance, and its flowers are typically tubular with vibrant colors such as red, orange, or yellow. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and prefers partial to full sun exposure. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
<p>Achimenes comifera is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes comifera has heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. Its flowers are tubular with a spurred shape, typically in shades of pink or red, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in moist environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes comifera is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is now cultivated in various regions with similar climatic conditions, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. It typically grows at altitudes between 300 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Achimenes comifera is not considered threatened, but its wild populations are relatively rare and require conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.</p>
