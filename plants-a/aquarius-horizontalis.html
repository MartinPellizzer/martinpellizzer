<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves that resemble the spokes of a wheel. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and lakes. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, allowing it to float on the water's surface.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
