                <h1>Achillea tyrolensis</h1>
<p>Achillea tyrolensis, commonly known as the Tyrol yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is a perennial herb that can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters, often forming dense, low-growing mats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea tyrolensis has basal leaves that are narrow, linear to lanceolate in shape, with a gray-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, somewhat hairy, and have a reddish-brown color, growing from the base of the plant. The flowers are composite, consisting of ray florets that are white to pale yellow, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant in its alpine habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea tyrolensis is primarily native to the European Alps, specifically in regions spanning Austria, Switzerland, and Italy.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. This plant thrives in cool, temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its native range includes parts of the Carpathian Mountains as well.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the alpine flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea tyrolensis was mainly introduced to gardens and landscapes in North America and Europe as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fluffy flower heads and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in cultivated areas, such as borders, rock gardens, and wildflower meadows. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for low-maintenance gardening. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range in the Alps, leading to ecological concerns in certain areas.</p>
