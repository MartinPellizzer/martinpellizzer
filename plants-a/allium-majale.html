                    <h1>Allium majale</h1>
<p>Allium majale, commonly known as the giant garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its large, elongated bulbs and tall, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a strong garlic-like flavor, making it a valuable crop in some regions.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated than other Allium species due to its specific growing requirements.</p>
