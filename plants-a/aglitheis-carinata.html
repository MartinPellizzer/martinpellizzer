                    <h1>Aglitheis carinata</h1>
<p>Aglitheis carinata, commonly known as the mountain pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and needle-like leaves arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against harsh weather conditions.</p>
<p>Aglitheis carinata plays a vital role in stabilizing mountainous terrain and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
