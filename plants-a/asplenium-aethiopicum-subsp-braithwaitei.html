<p>Asplenium aethiopicum subsp.</p>
<p>braithwaitei, commonly known as the African maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that resemble those of the common maidenhair fern.</p>
<p>This subspecies is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its small, spore-bearing sorus is located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
