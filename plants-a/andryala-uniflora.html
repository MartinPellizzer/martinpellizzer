                    <h1>Andryala uniflora</h1>
<p>Andryala uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower andryala, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to cold, moist environments. It is often found in rocky crevices and alpine meadows where it thrives in nutrient-poor soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Andryala uniflora is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
