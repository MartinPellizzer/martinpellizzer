                        <h1>Abutilon gebauerianum</h1>
<p>Abutilon gebauerianum, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family, Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive, spiny calyx that persists after flowering.</p>
<p>Abutilon gebauerianum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in warm climates due to its attractive foliage and long blooming period.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>

<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises a group of vascular plants that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their primitive features. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that typically have showy flowers and are often found in diverse habitats.</p>
<p>Its order is Malvales, a group of flowering plants that includes plants with distinctive flowers and often have a sympetalous corolla. Its family is Malvaceae, commonly known as the mallow family, which includes plants with showy flowers and often hairy stems.
