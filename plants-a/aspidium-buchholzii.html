                    <h1>Aspidium buchholzii</h1>
<p>Aspidium buchholzii, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is creeping and produces roots that help anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
