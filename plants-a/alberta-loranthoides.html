                    <h1>Alberta loranthoides</h1>
<p>Alberta loranthoides, commonly known as the Alberta mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of various coniferous trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its leafless stems and small, fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host tree's vascular system. It is native to the mountainous regions of Alberta, Canada, and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
