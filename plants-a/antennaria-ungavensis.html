<p>Antennaria ungavensis, commonly known as the Greenland mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Greenland.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit with small, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Antennaria ungavensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its extreme environment and supports local pollinators.</p>
