                <h1>Acer tetramerum var. dolichurum</h1>
<p>Acer tetramerum var. dolichurum, commonly known as the long-leaf maple, is a variant of the red maple species native to western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, serrated leaves that can reach up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it produces small, red samaras as its fruit.</p>
<p>The leaves turn vibrant shades of orange and red in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum var. dolichurum has alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 5â€“10 cm long, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged singly along the stems.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum var. dolichurum is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the western United States, specifically found in California.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Sierra Nevada and coastal ranges. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils within temperate rainforests and mixed hardwood forests. It typically grows at elevations between 500 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum var. dolichurum is a unique maple variety known for its striking red foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. This plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum var. dolichurum is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in native landscapes, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for stabilizing slopes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem by offering habitat and ecological benefits to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum var. dolichurum is a lesser-known variant of the maple tree with limited direct culinary use, though its sap may be tapped for syrup in niche contexts.</p>
<p>It has been explored for its potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, though further research is needed. Industrially, it contributes to local ecosystems and may support biodiversity, though it lacks significant economic value in commercial markets. Culturally, it may hold symbolic meaning in indigenous or regional traditions, though specific applications are not well documented.</p>
<p>Overall, its role remains largely ecological and understudied in practical applications.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum var. dolichurum has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Crimson Queen' and 'Tarnkappe', which exhibit striking red foliage in the fall.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, such as Acer palmatum, to produce cultivars with enhanced color and growth habits. These hybrids often display improved cold hardiness and more vibrant autumn coloration. The horticultural importance of this variety lies in its ability to add seasonal interest to gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage and adaptability make it a sought-after choice for ornamental horticulture.</p>
