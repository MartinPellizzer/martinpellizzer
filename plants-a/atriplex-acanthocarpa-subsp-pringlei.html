<p>Atriplex acanthocarpa subsp.</p>
<p>pringlei, commonly known as Pringle's saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, which are pollinated by insects. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to desert and coastal habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
