                <h1>Actaea corymbosa</h1>
<p>Actaea corymbosa, commonly known as white cohosh, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, white, corymbose flowers. The plant produces berries that are red when mature, containing seeds dispersed by birds. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in rich, loamy soils.</p>
<p>Actaea corymbosa is valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea corymbosa has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are doubly pinnate, with small, ovate leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, smooth, and somewhat hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker and more rugged with age. It produces upright, corymbose inflorescences of white, petal-like bracts that bloom in early summer, and the flowers are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a red, berry-like aggregate that disperses seeds through birds and animals.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea corymbosa is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, wooded areas such as forests and stream valleys. This plant thrives in regions with cool, temperate climates and well-drained soil. Its range extends from the northeastern United States down to the southeastern parts of the country.</p>
<p>It is also present in parts of Ontario and Quebec in Canada.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea corymbosa was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly in the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in gardens and naturalized in various regions, especially in the eastern United States. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and has spread along forest edges and disturbed habitats. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, careful monitoring is recommended to prevent its spread into sensitive ecosystems.</p>
