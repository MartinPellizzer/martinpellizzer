                            <h1>Alchemilla Vulgaris Var. Wichurae</h1>
<p>Lady's mantle, scientifically known as Alchemilla vulgaris var. wichurae, is a hardy perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense rosette of heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. This plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is commonly found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its common name is derived from its historical use in herbal medicine and its ability to heal wounds. With its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, Lady's mantle is a valuable addition to gardens and natural landscapes.</p>
