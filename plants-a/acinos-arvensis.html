                <h1>Acinos arvensis</h1>
<p>Acinos arvensis, commonly known as the field dandelion, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are spoon-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are yellow, typically appearing in clusters. The plant produces a capsule fruit that contains numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its hairy stems and its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos arvensis has small, oblanceolate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a rough, grayish-brown bark, and it grows in a clump-like pattern. Its flowers are yellow, consisting of five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant establish quickly in disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos arvensis is primarily native to temperate regions of Europe, including countries such as France, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open habitats like grasslands and meadows. This species is also known to occur in parts of western Asia, particularly in Turkey and the Caucasus region. It thrives in sunny locations with well-drained soils and is often associated with agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Acinos arvensis is a low-growing plant with small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer months.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos arvensis was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the United States and Canada, as a result of human activities such as agricultural expansion and unintentional transport through trade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats, including roadsides, fields, and waste areas, where it thrives in disturbed soils. This plant has adapted well to temperate climates and can tolerate a range of soil conditions, contributing to its successful establishment in new environments. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native plant species in certain regions.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, Acinos arvensis is also studied for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a potential forage plant.</p>
