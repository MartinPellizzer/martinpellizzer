<p>Agrostis signata var. sylvatica, commonly known as the woodland bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy, with a basal rosette structure. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, greenish-brown flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small organisms in woodland ecosystems.</p>
