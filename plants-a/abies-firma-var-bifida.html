                        <h1>Abies firma var. bifida</h1>
<p>Abies firma var. bifida, commonly known as the twin-leaf fir, is a rare and unique variant of the fir tree native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive bifid (split) leaves, which give it a striking appearance compared to typical fir species. The plant exhibits a conical shape with dense, dark green foliage that turns a silvery-blue hue during the winter months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found at high elevations where it forms part of the subalpine forest ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
