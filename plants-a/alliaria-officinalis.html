<p>Alliaria officinalis, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard plants, and is characterized by its pinnately divided leaves and small white or purple flowers. The plant produces rounded, three-lobed seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is known for its strong garlic-like odor, which comes from sulfur compounds in its leaves and roots.</p>
<p>Alliaria officinalis is often found in woodland areas and has been introduced to other regions where it can become invasive.</p>
