                    <h1>Adenostegia ramosa</h1>
<p>Adenostegia ramosa, commonly known as the hairy broom, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, branching structure, which give it a bushy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Adenostegia ramosa is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in restoration projects.</p>
