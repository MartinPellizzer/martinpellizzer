                <h1>Actinolema macrolema</h1>
<p>Actinolema macrolema, commonly known as the broadleaf daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other composite flowers. The plant features showy, daisy-like flowers with white petals surrounding a yellow center, and it has hairy, narrow leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Actinolema macrolema is known for its resilience and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinolema macrolema has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinolema macrolema is primarily native to Iran, Iraq, Lebanon-Syria, Transcaucasus, and Turkey.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in regions with temperate to subtropical climates. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on cliffs or in mountainous areas. The distribution of Actinolema macrolema reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecological conditions of these regions.</p>
<p>Its presence in these areas highlights its importance in local flora and ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinolema macrolema was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant outcompetes native species for resources, leading to biodiversity loss.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the risks associated with non-native plant species in ecological systems.</p>
