                    <h1>Angraecum neglectum var. curtum</h1>
<p>Angraecum neglectum var. curtum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, with a distinctive central column. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on trees without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance, which attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
