                <h1>Adelobotrys antioquiensis</h1>
<p>Adelobotrys antioquiensis, commonly known as the Antioquian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the mountainous regions of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and white, sticky berries. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as oak and pine, drawing water and nutrients from them. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for birds and other animals that consume its berries.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys antioquiensis has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are glossy green on top and lighter in color underneath, typically measuring around 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys antioquiensis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of western Colombia, specifically in the Antioquia Department.</p>
<p>It is found in the cloud forests and humid montane areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters above sea level. This species is endemic to this region, meaning it is not found anywhere else in the world. It thrives in the cool, moist climate typical of these high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited geographic range, it is considered a rare and threatened plant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys antioquiensis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high humidity and moderate temperatures, making it suitable for cultivation in shaded garden beds or as an ornamental plant. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions. It is also valued for its potential in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>However, its introduction can sometimes lead to competition with native species in invaded habitats.</p>
