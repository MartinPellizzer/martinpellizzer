<p>Adelobotrys antioquiensis, commonly known as the Antioquian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the mountainous regions of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and white, sticky berries. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as oak and pine, drawing water and nutrients from them. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for birds and other animals that consume its berries.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
