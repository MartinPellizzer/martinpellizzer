                    <h1>Athyrium nephrodioides</h1>
<p>Athyrium nephrodioides, commonly known as the kidney-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate fronds that resemble the shape of a kidney. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are bioluminescent and emit a faint blue glow at night, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This rare and beautiful fern is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
