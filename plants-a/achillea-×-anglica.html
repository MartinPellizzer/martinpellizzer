                <h1>Achillea × anglica</h1>
<p>Achillea × anglica, commonly known as the common yarrow, is a hybrid perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, finely divided leaves and flat, composite flower heads that range from white to pink or red. The plant typically grows in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Achillea × anglica is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and has a long history of medicinal use in traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × anglica has compound, fern-like leaves that are gray-green in color, with a silvery-white underside, and they are arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, smooth, and somewhat woody, with a light green to reddish-brown color, and they grow in a bushy, clumping pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray flowers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small, dry achene enclosed in a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × anglica is a hybrid plant that originates from the natural hybridization between Achillea millefolium and Achillea ptarmica, primarily in Europe.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of Europe, particularly the British Isles, where it was once a common wildflower. Today, it is found in various regions across Europe, including southern England, France, and parts of Germany, often in disturbed or cultivated soils. It thrives in a variety of environments, such as meadows, roadsides, and wastelands, typically at low altitudes ranging from sea level to about 500 meters.</p>
<p>Despite its historical presence, it is considered a rare or locally extinct species in many areas, and its conservation status is generally vulnerable due to habitat loss and competition from invasive species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea × anglica is a hardy perennial that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring moderate watering to avoid root rot.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or division of the rhizomes, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining cultivar characteristics. The plant has a biennial growth cycle, flowering in its second year before dying back, though it often reseeds itself for continuous growth. Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering promote dense growth and prevent legginess.</p>
<p>It is generally pest and disease resistant but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions, making companion planting with marigolds or chives beneficial for natural pest control.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea × anglica is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts beneficial insects and birds, contributing to biodiversity in local ecosystems. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other wildflowers to enhance soil health and promote a diverse plant community. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing land.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers shelter and food for small wildlife, playing a vital role in maintaining ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea × anglica is a hybrid plant known for its ornamental value and historical significance.</p>
<p>It has been used in culinary applications, particularly in the preparation of herbal teas and as a flavoring agent in some traditional recipes. Medicinally, it has been employed in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Industrially, it contributes to the horticultural economy by being a popular garden plant.</p>
<p>Culturally, it has symbolic meanings, often associated with protection and remembrance in various traditions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea × anglica has a variety of cultivars and hybrids that are widely appreciated in horticulture for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Himalaya' and 'Caucasica', known for their compact growth and vibrant yellow flowers. Hybrids of Achillea × anglica often combine traits from both parent species, resulting in plants with improved hardiness and flowering characteristics. These plants are valued for their ability to thrive in various garden conditions, making them a popular choice for borders and meadows.</p>
<p>Their horticultural importance is further enhanced by their long bloom period and low maintenance requirements.</p>
