                <h1>Acinos eglandulosus</h1>
<p>Acinos eglandulosus, commonly known as the leafy cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with basal leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a hairy stem and is characterized by its five-lobed leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Rosaceae family, sharing characteristics with other members such as roses and strawberries.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos eglandulosus has leaves that are typically narrow, linear to lanceolate in shape, with a slightly hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a bluish-gray or silver-green color due to a dense coating of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and branching, with a rough, hairy texture and a pale green to reddish-brown color, growing in a clump-like formation. The flowers are small, clustered in dense, spherical heads, with white to pale pink petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in rocky or dry environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos eglandulosus is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and coastal areas. This plant thrives in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. It is often seen in disturbed soils and can be found in both coastal and inland areas.</p>
<p>Acinos eglandulosus is an important part of the local flora and plays a role in supporting native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos eglandulosus was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in disturbed areas such as roadsides, open woodlands, and grasslands. The plant is often seen in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its introduction has been linked to human activity, including seed dispersal through transportation and gardening.</p>
<p>Despite its non-native status, it has become established in several ecological communities across its range.</p>
