<p>Anogramma rosea, commonly known as the rose moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like appearance with small, overlapping leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its leaves are often covered in a thin layer of mucilage, which helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Anogramma rosea plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
