<p>Adiantum obtusum var. kunzei, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are broad at the base and taper towards the tips. The plant produces delicate, spore-bearing sori on the underside of its fronds, which are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
