<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect shrub form. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in compact clusters, which are typically visited by a variety of pollinators. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Acacia mariae is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia mariae belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises vascular plants with a diverse range of forms, including ferns and some modern seed plants. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species such as roses and magnolias.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have flowers with five petals and include legumes and other related families. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume family, characterized by pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities.

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia mariae is primarily native to New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal and inland regions of the state. This plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils. It is often seen in open woodlands and heathlands.</p>
<p>Acacia mariae plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia mariae was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in reforestation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, which improve soil fertility. It has been introduced to several countries in Africa and the Middle East as part of ecological restoration efforts.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential in some areas has raised concerns about its impact on native flora.</p>
