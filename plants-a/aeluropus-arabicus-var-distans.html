                    <h1>Aeluropus arabicus var. distans</h1>
<p>Aeluropus arabicus var. distans, commonly known as the desert grass or coastal grass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted morphology with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in coastal dunes, salt marshes, and other saline soils, playing a vital role in stabilizing these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its resilience to extreme conditions makes it an important component of desert and coastal vegetation.</p>
