                        <h1>Acanthophyllum mikeschinianum</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum mikeschinianum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Acanthophyllum mikeschinianum is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall.</p>
