<p>Agrostis arenosa, commonly known as sandy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open habitats such as dunes, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, spikelets, which produce wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Agrostis arenosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate harsh environmental conditions.</p>
