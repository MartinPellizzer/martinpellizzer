                <h1>Adactylus ellipticus</h1>
<p>Adactylus ellipticus, commonly known as the elliptical leaf scale, is a species of scale insect belonging to the family Diaspididae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, elliptical body shape and a waxy, shield-like covering that protects its soft body. The plant it infests typically exhibits yellowing and deformation of leaves due to the insect's feeding habits. It is often found on various ornamental and fruit-bearing plants, making it a significant pest in horticulture.</p>
<p>Its life cycle includes several stages, from egg to adult, with females remaining sessile throughout most of their lives.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adactylus ellipticus has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are a deep green color and have a smooth, waxy texture. The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant grows. It produces small, clustered flowers with yellow petals and a reddish center, blooming in the spring and relying on insect pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that contains small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adactylus ellipticus is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. This plant is commonly found in rocky soils and dry grasslands. It is also present in some regions of the Middle East and southern Turkey.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to areas with sufficient sunlight and well-drained soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adactylus ellipticus was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and urban areas. This species thrives in warm, humid climates and is often associated with human-altered environments. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has spread to other regions with similar climatic conditions.</p>
