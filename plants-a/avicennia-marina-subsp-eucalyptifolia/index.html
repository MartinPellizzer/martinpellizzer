<p>White mangrove, scientifically known as Avicennia marina subsp. eucalyptifolia, is a resilient tree species that thrives in coastal environments. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and preventing erosion. The plant is characterized by its white, fuzzy leaves and ability to tolerate saltwater, making it an important component of mangrove ecosystems. Its unique adaptations allow it to flourish in brackish and saline conditions, contributing to biodiversity in coastal areas. Despite its ecological importance, the white mangrove faces threats from human activities and climate change.</p>
