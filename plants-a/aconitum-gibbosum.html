                <h1>Aconitum gibbosum</h1>
<p>Aconitum gibbosum, commonly known as the humped aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine down. Aconitum gibbosum grows up to 1.5 meters tall, with a sturdy stem that supports its showy floral display.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum gibbosum has palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, typically greenish-brown in color, with a growth pattern that is upright and herbaceous. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petal-like sepals and numerous stamens, blooming in late summer and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, aiding in the plant's survival in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum gibbosum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in alpine and subalpine habitats, particularly in rocky soils and open slopes. This plant is distributed across countries such as Austria, Italy, France, and Switzerland. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often associated with high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into parts of the Balkans and the Carpathian Mountains.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum gibbosum was mainly introduced to North America through intentional cultivation by horticulturists and gardeners who admired its striking floral display.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the Pacific Northwest and parts of the eastern United States. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in disturbed soils along streambanks and forest edges. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to spread into native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, careful monitoring is recommended to prevent it from becoming invasive.</p>
