<p>Asplenium plumbeum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a dense, compact growth habit with fronds that are typically gray-green in color due to the presence of fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spore-bearing structures called sori, which are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or woodland areas.</p>
<p>Asplenium plumbeum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
