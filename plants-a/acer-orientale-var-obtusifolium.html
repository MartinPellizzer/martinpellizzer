                <h1>Acer orientale var. obtusifolium</h1>
<p>Acer orientale var. obtusifolium, commonly known as the Japanese maple with blunt leaves, is a deciduous tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, and often lobed leaves that are typically a vibrant green during the growing season. In autumn, the leaves transform into striking shades of red, orange, and yellow, making it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has a compact, rounded shape with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops fissures with age.</p>
<p>It prefers partial shade and well-drained soil, and is relatively slow-growing, making it suitable for smaller gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer orientale var. obtusifolium has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, with a blunt tip, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length; they are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin strips, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, with a simple structure consisting of four petals, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod, which disperses by wind, allowing the seeds to travel several meters from the parent plant.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer orientale var. obtusifolium is a rare variant of the oriental maple, native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>While its original range is limited, it is now primarily found in botanical gardens and conservation sites outside its native habitat. This plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded forest environments. It typically occurs at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, where cooler temperatures and higher humidity support its growth.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires protected status to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer orientale var. obtusifolium is a striking ornamental maple known for its unique foliage and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. This variety has a slow to moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity over several years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or sage can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer orientale var. obtusifolium is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of nearby species by improving soil conditions. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and contributing to the overall resilience of forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer orientale var. obtusifolium is a lesser-known variant of the maple tree, primarily valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves have been occasionally explored for potential herbal uses in traditional medicine, though scientific validation remains limited. The tree contributes to local biodiversity and provides habitat for various wildlife species, supporting ecological balance in its native regions. In cultural contexts, it may hold symbolic significance in local traditions or be used in decorative arts.</p>
<p>Its economic role is more indirect, contributing to the timber and plant trade in specific regions where it is cultivated.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer orientale var. obtusifolium has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their unique leaf shapes and colors, including 'Aureum' with golden foliage and 'Variegatum' featuring white-variegated leaves.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, leading to the development of cultivars like 'Emerald Glow' and 'Crimson Queen' that exhibit enhanced ornamental traits. These hybrids often display more vibrant autumn colors and improved hardiness, making them popular in horticulture. The species is valued for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions.</p>
<p>Its cultivars and hybrids play a significant role in ornamental horticulture, especially in regions with temperate climates.</p>
