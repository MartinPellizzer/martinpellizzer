<p>Antennaria friesiana subsp.</p>
<p>compacta, commonly known as the dwarf mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features a dense mat of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
