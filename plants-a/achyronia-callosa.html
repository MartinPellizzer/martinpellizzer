                <h1>Achyronia callosa</h1>
<p>Achyronia callosa, commonly known as the roughleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in small, waxy bumps. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps it thrive in dry, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Achyronia callosa is often found in arid environments such as deserts and mountain slopes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia callosa has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, bark-like texture that is usually grayish-brown in color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with five petals that are pale yellow to greenish-white in color, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia callosa is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. This plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland wetlands. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of wetland health.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia callosa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed woodlands.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. The plant is commonly found in the eastern United States, particularly in states like Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>However, it is often considered a native plant in its introduced range and is used in landscaping for its ornamental value.</p>
