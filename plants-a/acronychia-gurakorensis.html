                <h1>Acronychia gurakorensis</h1>
<p>Acronychia gurakorensis, commonly known as the Gura Korensis Acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in parts of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. This tree is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, three-lobed fruits.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia gurakorensis has compound, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color, and it grows as an upright shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and arranged in clusters, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia gurakorensis is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this region, particularly in the eastern and western parts of the island. This plant thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing along riverbanks and in dense undergrowth. It is a small to medium-sized tree that plays an important role in the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia gurakorensis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in gardens and landscapes across regions such as Hawaii, Guam, and parts of French Polynesia. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it suitable for coastal and inland areas with well-drained soil. Its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness, as it can spread rapidly in natural habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, careful management is recommended to prevent it from becoming a weed in native ecosystems.</p>
