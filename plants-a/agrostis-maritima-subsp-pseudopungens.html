<p>Agrostis maritima subsp.</p>
<p>pseudopungens, commonly known as the coastal bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to coastal regions. It typically forms dense, mat-like vegetation that helps stabilize sandy or muddy shorelines.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to salty and windy environments, often found in dunes and tidal areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important pioneer species in coastal succession.</p>
