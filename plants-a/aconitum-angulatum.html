                <h1>Aconitum angulatum</h1>
<p>Aconitum angulatum, commonly known as the angular aconite, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae) and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and clusters of blue to violet flowers. The plant produces follicles containing seeds that are dispersed by wind, and its leaves are deeply lobed with a distinctive angular appearance.</p>
<p>Aconitum angulatum contains toxic alkaloids, making it a plant that requires caution when handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum angulatum has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically reaching up to 20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. The flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and clustered in racemes, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, anchoring the plant and storing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum angulatum is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely restricted to its native range, with limited cultivation in botanical gardens and research institutions. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous environments, often found in meadows and rocky slopes. This species typically grows at altitudes between 2,000 and 4,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Aconitum angulatum is classified as a vulnerable species in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aconitum angulatum is a striking perennial plant known for its elegant, spiky flowers and preference for cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing the rhizomes, with the latter method being more reliable for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. This plant has a growth cycle that begins with spring growth, flowering in late summer, and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring helps promote healthy growth, while pruning dead foliage in late autumn keeps the plant tidy. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or hostas can enhance its aesthetic appeal and create a lush, shady garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Aconitum angulatum is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its attractive blue-violet flowers attract a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, contributing to biodiversity in its habitat. It acts as a companion plant in native gardens, supporting the growth of other native species. Additionally, its dense foliage helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the soil in wet or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>While it does not fix nitrogen, it enhances the overall health of the ecosystem through its role in pollination and habitat support.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Aconitum angulatum is a striking plant known for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its distinctive, colorful flowers.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, it has a historical role in traditional medicine, where its roots were once used for their purported analgesic properties. However, due to its extreme toxicity, it is not used in modern industrial or economic contexts. Culturally, it has been symbolized in various art forms and botanical illustrations, reflecting its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Overall, its primary role remains ornamental, with caution required due to its poisonous nature.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Aconitum angulatum has several popular cultivars such as 'Belle Ã‰toile' and 'Carnivora', which are prized for their striking blue to purple flowers and robust growth.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other aconite species to produce a wide range of cultivars with varying flower colors and growth habits. These hybrids often exhibit improved hardiness and longer blooming periods, making them more suitable for garden cultivation. Horticulturally, Aconitum angulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shady garden conditions.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids contribute significantly to the diversity of the aconite genus in both garden and landscape settings.</p>
