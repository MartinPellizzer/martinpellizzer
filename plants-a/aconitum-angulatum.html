                <h1>Aconitum angulatum</h1>
<p>Aconitum angulatum, commonly known as the angular aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has palmately divided, deeply cut leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Aconitum angulatum contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum angulatum has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stems are smooth, cylindrical, and have a reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, growing upright and unbranched. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple spurs, arranged in dense spikes, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storage and survival in various soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum angulatum is primarily native to Nepal.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and central parts. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forests and along stream banks. It is adapted to the cool and humid climate of Nepal's high altitude regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Nepal's diverse landscape.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum angulatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and streambanks. This plant has become naturalized in several states, including Oregon and Washington. It is often mistaken for native aconite species due to its similar appearance.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid spread and competitive nature.</p>
