                        <h1>Acanthophyllum kermanense</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum kermanense, commonly known as the Kerman sandmat, is a low-growing, perennial shrub native to arid regions of Iran.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and compact growth habit. The plant thrives in sandy and saline soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters and are pollinated by wind and insects.</p>
<p>Acanthophyllum kermanense plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acanthophyllum kermanense belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises vascular plants with a distinctive structure and includes ferns and horsetails. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many familiar species such as roses and magnolias.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes plants with showy flowers and often contains species adapted to arid environments. Its family is Caryophyllaceae, known as the carnation family, which includes plants with simple leaves and flowers with five petals. Its genus is Acanthophyllum, a group of flowering plants typically found in arid regions, characterized by their spiny leaves and small flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acanthophyllum kermanense, a specific type of flowering plant native to certain regions of Iran, known for its adaptations to dry and harsh environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
