<p>Asemeia ovata, commonly known as the oval leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are ovate in shape, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed berries that are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>Asemeia ovata plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
