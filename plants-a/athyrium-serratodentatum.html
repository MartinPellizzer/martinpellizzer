                    <h1>Athyrium serratodentatum</h1>
<p>Athyrium serratodentatum, commonly known as the serrated toothed lady fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
