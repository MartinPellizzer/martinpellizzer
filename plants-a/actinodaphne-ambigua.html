<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant is known for its ability to produce camphor, a volatile oil used in traditional medicine and industry. It typically grows in lowland rainforests and thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The tree's botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne ambigua has elliptical, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems, with a slightly leathery texture and a smooth margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exudes a faintly aromatic scent when cut.

<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in moist, shaded soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne ambigua is primarily native to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the wet zones. This species typically grows in lowland evergreen forests and secondary forests. It is often associated with shaded environments and is not commonly found in open areas.</p>
<p>The plant is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the humid climate of Sri Lanka.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne ambigua was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. This plant thrives in lowland forests and secondary growth areas, often growing as an understory species. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activities like horticulture and land clearing.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become established in several regions beyond its native range.</p>
