<p>Adenochlaena, commonly known as the "false dandelion," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk flowers, typical of the daisy family. Adenochlaena species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. They have hairy stems and leaves, and their flowers are usually yellow, with a central disk surrounded by petal-like structures.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
