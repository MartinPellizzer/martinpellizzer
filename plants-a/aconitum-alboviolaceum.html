                <h1>Aconitum alboviolaceum</h1>
<p>Aconitum alboviolaceum, commonly known as the white-violet aconite, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pale violet to white flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and cool, moist climates. Its leaves are palmately compound, with finely divided lobes, and it produces tall, sparsely branched stems.</p>
<p>Aconitum alboviolaceum is known for its toxic properties, containing various alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum alboviolaceum has large, palmately compound leaves that are broadly ovate to reniform in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hollow, and covered with a smooth, bluish-green bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its flowers are showy, blue-violet in color, with five sepals and petals, arranged in a spire-like inflorescence, blooming in late summer and attracting pollinators such as bees through nectar. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients and surviving in poor soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum alboviolaceum is primarily native to China North-Central, Korea, Manchuria, and Primorye.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in mountainous regions within these areas. It thrives in moist, temperate climates with well-drained soil. The species is often associated with forested or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its natural range reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of East Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum alboviolaceum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue and purple flowers. However, it has since become a weed in some areas, posing a threat to native ecosystems. The plant is now considered invasive in certain regions of the country.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread and prevent further ecological damage.</p>
