                    <h1>Apocynum breweri</h1>
<p>Apocynum breweri, commonly known as the Texas milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in summer. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores.</p>
<p>Apocynum breweri plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees.</p>
