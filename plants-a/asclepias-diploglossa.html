                    <h1>Asclepias diploglossa</h1>
<p>Asclepias diploglossa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender stems and lance-shaped leaves, which are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Asclepias diploglossa is a critical host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, providing both food and shelter.</p>
<p>Its latex sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many herbivores but essential for the monarch's defense mechanisms.</p>
