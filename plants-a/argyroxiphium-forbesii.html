                    <h1>Argyroxiphium forbesii</h1>
<p>Argyroxiphium forbesii, commonly known as the Haleakalā silversword, is a rare endemic plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui.</p>
<p>It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and striking, spiky flower heads. The plant thrives in the high-elevation volcanic soils of Haleakalā Crater, where it has adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited habitat and historical overharvesting, it is listed as an endangered species.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts have helped stabilize its population, but it remains a symbol of Hawaii's unique botanical heritage.</p>
