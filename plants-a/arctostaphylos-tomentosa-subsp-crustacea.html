<p>Arctostaphylos tomentosa subsp.</p>
<p>crustacea, commonly known as the coastal manzanita, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing form and thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, woolly layer of hair.</p>
