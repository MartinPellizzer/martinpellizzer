                <h1>Actinidia carnosifolia</h1>
<p>Actinidia carnosifolia, commonly known as the hairy actinidia, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically hairy on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible, fuzzy berries that ripen in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is often cultivated for both aesthetic and culinary purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia carnosifolia has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 3 to 8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and twining, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring, typically arranged in clusters, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, dispersing primarily by birds and other animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia carnosifolia is primarily native to China, specifically the provinces of Hubei, Sichuan, and Yunnan.</p>
<p>It thrives in the mountainous regions of these areas, often in temperate and subtropical climates. This plant is commonly found in forests and along riverbanks, where it benefits from partial shade and moist, well-drained soil. It is a member of the Actinidiaceae family and is known for its edible fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia carnosifolia was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as along stream banks and in forest understories. The plant has been introduced for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and fruit. It has also been used in ecological restoration projects because of its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native plants.</p>
