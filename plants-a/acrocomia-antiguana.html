                <h1>Acrocomia antiguana</h1>
<p>Acrocomia antiguana, commonly known as the windmill palm, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a tall, slender palm with a single, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into spiny, woody fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forest and savanna habitats.</p>
<p>The windmill palm is valued for its ornamental appearance and its use in traditional medicine and cuisine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocomia antiguana has compound, pinnate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 30 to 60 cm in length, with a dark green coloration on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright, often forming a single trunk. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with yellow petals and stamens, blooming during the dry season, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a large, spiny capsule that contains numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in water absorption and soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocomia antiguana is primarily native to the tropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and the Caribbean islands. This plant thrives in dry to semi-arid climates and is often associated with coastal dunes and sandy soils. It is also present in some areas of the southern United States, particularly in Texas and Florida.</p>
<p>Acrocomia antiguana is an important species for both ecological and economic purposes in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocomia antiguana was mainly introduced to provide a sustainable source of edible nuts and for its use in agroforestry systems.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in well-drained soils. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a shade tree in agricultural landscapes. Its introduction has also supported local economies through nut harvesting and processing.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent potential invasiveness in new environments.</p>
