                    <h1>Avena pensylvanica</h1>
<p>Avena pensylvanica, commonly known as Pennsylvania oat, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania oat is valued for its ecological role in supporting wildlife and stabilizing soil in wetland areas.</p>
