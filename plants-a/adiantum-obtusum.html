                <h1>Adiantum obtusum</h1>
<p>Adiantum obtusum, commonly known as the blunt fern, is a species of polypod fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, triangular-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering.</p>
<p>Adiantum obtusum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation in humid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum obtusum has fern-like leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a bipinnate pattern, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth texture and a light brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, typically blooming in late spring. The fruit is a dry, capsule that disperses its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum obtusum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with high humidity and warm climates. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. It is often seen growing on rocks or in the undergrowth of dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Its native range also extends to parts of New Guinea and the Pacific islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum obtusum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. This fern is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its delicate, lace-like fronds. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California.</p>
<p>Its introduction is largely attributed to horticultural practices and accidental spread through landscaping.</p>
