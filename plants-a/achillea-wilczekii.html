                <h1>Achillea wilczekii</h1>
<p>Achillea wilczekii, commonly known as the Karakorum yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. It is often found in meadows and slopes at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea wilczekii has basal leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, with a greyish-green color and a hairy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a pale greenish-brown bark that remains smooth. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and colonize new areas.</p>
