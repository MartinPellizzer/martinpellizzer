                        <h1>Acer dasycarpum f. serpentinum</h1>
<p>Acer dasycarpum f. serpentinum, commonly known as the serpentine maple, is a unique variant of the Chinese maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that resemble serpents, hence its common name. The plant is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils, particularly on serpentine rock formations. Its leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a serrated edge.</p>
<p>This ornamental tree is valued for its striking foliage and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum f. serpentinum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>This variant of the downy maple is adapted to grow in rocky and limestone-rich soils, often found in temperate forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is commonly associated with subalpine and alpine habitats. The plant is well-suited to the cool, humid climate of these regions and is often found in mixed hardwood forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is relatively limited, reflecting its specific ecological requirements and geographic isolation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer dasycarpum f. serpentinum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically found in woodland or forested regions.</p>
<p>This distribution is primarily due to its preference for cool, temperate climates and its ability to thrive in environments with high humidity. It is commonly found in regions with a history of cultivation or naturalization, such as parts of eastern North America. The plant's introduction is often associated with horticultural practices and landscape gardening.</p>
<p>Its presence in these areas highlights its adaptability and ornamental value.</p>
