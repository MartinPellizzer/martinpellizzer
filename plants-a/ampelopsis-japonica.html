                    <h1>Ampelopsis japonica</h1>
<p>Ampelopsis japonica, commonly known as Japanese honeysuckle, is a deciduous climbing vine native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in the summer. The plant produces orange-red berries that are edible but often considered a weed in agricultural settings. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its vigorous growth and rapid spread make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive.</p>
