<p>Aralia rugosa, commonly known as Japanese angelica tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves that are palmately lobed, with a rough, textured surface that gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, which are followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Aralia rugosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures.</p>
