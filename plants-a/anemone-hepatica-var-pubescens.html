                    <h1>Anemone hepatica var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Anemone hepatica var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy liverleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, early spring blooms of delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of white or pale yellow. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>The hairy pubescence on its leaves and stems helps reduce water loss and provides some protection against herbivores.</p>
