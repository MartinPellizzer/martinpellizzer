                <h1>Acokanthera rhodesica</h1>
<p>Acokanthera rhodesica, commonly known as the Rhodesian arrow poison, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant is notable for its toxic alkaloids, which have been traditionally used by indigenous peoples for arrow poison. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces small, berry-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided by livestock and requires careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acokanthera rhodesica has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they range in size from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight, upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and helping it survive in dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera rhodesica is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky habitats and savanna regions. This plant thrives in areas with moderate to high sunlight exposure and well-drained soils. It is often associated with bushveld and mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically used for medicinal or ornamental purposes in traditional practices.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera rhodesica was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it is commonly found in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, and Mpumalanga provinces.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and riverine vegetation. The plant is known for its toxic properties, making it a significant concern in agricultural and ecological contexts. It has been introduced to various regions for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential and toxicity have led to careful management in some areas.</p>
