<p>Adiantum stubelii, commonly known as the African maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Adiantum stubelii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and indoor spaces.</p>
