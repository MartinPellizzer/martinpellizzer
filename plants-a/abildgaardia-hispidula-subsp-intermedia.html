<p>Abildgaardia hispidula subsp.</p>
<p>intermedia, commonly known as the rough-haired abildgaardia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>

<p>intermedia is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia. It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often associated with disturbed or transitional habitats. It is an important component of the wetland flora in these regions.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the humid climate and seasonal flooding typical of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abildgaardia hispidula subsp.</p>
<p>intermedia was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature.</p>
<p>The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and has minimal impact on native ecosystems.</p>
