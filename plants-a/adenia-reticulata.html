                <h1>Adenia reticulata</h1>
<p>Adenia reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined adenium, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by orange or red fruits. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its swollen stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia reticulata has leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; they are usually 5â€“15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are large and showy, with a complex structure featuring a central column and three sepals, and they are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia reticulata is primarily native to Angola, Cameroon, Congo, DR Congo, Gabon, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical rainforests and moist woodland areas across these regions. It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils. The species is often associated with shaded undergrowth in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its natural distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse habitats of Central and West Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia reticulata was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with partial to full sunlight and requires consistent moisture. This plant is commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia, parts of Africa, and the Pacific Islands. Its introduction has often been associated with horticultural practices and landscape gardening.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
