<p>Allium montenegrinum, commonly known as the Montenegro garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>

The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in appearance to garlic but have a milder flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>
