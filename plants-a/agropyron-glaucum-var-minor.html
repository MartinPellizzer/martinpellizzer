                    <h1>Agropyron glaucum var. minor</h1>
<p>Agropyron glaucum var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to harsh environments, including high altitudes and poor soils, making it a resilient species.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
