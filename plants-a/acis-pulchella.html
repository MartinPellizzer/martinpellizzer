                <h1>Acis pulchella</h1>
<p>Acis pulchella, commonly known as the showy acis, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Primulaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in countries like Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Acis pulchella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acis pulchella has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and often grows in a prostrate or sprawling manner, with a pale green color and a smooth texture. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in umbels, with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acis pulchella is primarily native to the eastern United States, including regions such as New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and parts of the Southeast.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is commonly found in acidic soils. This plant is particularly associated with the Appalachian Mountains and the coastal plain regions. It is often seen in shaded understories of forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Acis pulchella is an important component of the native flora in these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acis pulchella was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and along stream banks. This plant is often associated with disturbed sites and can thrive in areas with high humidity. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to outcompete native species in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is important to monitor its spread to manage its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
