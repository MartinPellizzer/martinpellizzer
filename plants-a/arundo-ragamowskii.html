                    <h1>Arundo ragamowskii</h1>
<p>Arundo ragamowskii, commonly known as the Mexican reed or reed canary grass, is a perennial grass native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in summer, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways, often forming dense stands that can dominate aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in non-native regions.</p>
