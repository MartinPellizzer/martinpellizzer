                    <h1>Arthrostemma pusillum</h1>
<p>Arthrostemma pusillum, commonly known as the small arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to the wetlands of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapting to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is often used in wetland restoration projects.</p>
