<p>Artemisia globularia, commonly known as globe artemisia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, gray-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in complex, branched inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The leaves contain essential oils and have been used traditionally for their aromatic and medicinal properties.</p>
