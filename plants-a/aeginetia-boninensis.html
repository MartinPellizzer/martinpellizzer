                <h1>Aeginetia boninensis</h1>
<p>Aeginetia boninensis, commonly known as the Bonin Islands thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Bonin Islands in the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal or sandy habitats, showing adaptation to saline and wind-exposed environments. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in clusters, and it produces small, spiny fruits that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeginetia boninensis has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a pale green bark that becomes rough and fissured with age. Its small, yellowish flowers are arranged in clusters, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the rocky soils of its native habitat.</p>
