                <h1>Acosta brachtii</h1>
<p>Acosta brachtii, commonly known as the golden cupuaçu, is a tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces a fruit that resembles a cupuaçu but has a distinct golden hue and a unique flavor profile. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological studies and potential commercial use.</p>
<p>Acosta brachtii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta brachtii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green color and slightly hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>Its stem is woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it grows in a bushy, upright pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta brachtii is primarily native to the Andean region of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes within the Andes. This plant thrives in temperate to cold climates and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous environments. It is often found in association with other Andean flora in these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within the Andean ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta brachtii was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in countries like Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. This plant has been introduced to new areas due to its adaptability and rapid growth rate. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
