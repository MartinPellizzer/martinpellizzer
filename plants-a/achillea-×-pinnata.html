                <h1>Achillea × pinnata</h1>
<p>Achillea × pinnata, commonly known as the yarrow hybrid, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and flat-topped clusters of small, fluffy white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is native to Europe and has been widely cultivated for its ornamental value and historical medicinal uses. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>Achillea × pinnata is known for its resilience and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × pinnata has compound, feathery leaves that are gray-green in color, with a flat or slightly rolled texture, and they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, hairy, and have a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age, growing upright and branching toward the top. The flowers are small, yellowish-green composite blooms with ray florets, typically blooming from late spring to early summer, and they are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind due to the feathery structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × pinnata is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and the Alps.</p>
<p>Its current distribution extends to parts of northern Africa and western Asia, where it has been introduced and sometimes becomes naturalized. It thrives in open, sunny environments such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. This species typically grows at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature and limited natural range, it is considered a rare plant with a conservation status that varies by region, often requiring protection in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea × pinnata is a hardy perennial known for its ornamental value and ease of care.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in spring or by seed sown in early fall. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in early spring and blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with a preference for full sun to partial shade. Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its form and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or lavender can enhance its appearance and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea × pinnata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, which contribute to the overall health of the ecosystem. This plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other native species to enhance biodiversity. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system, stabilizing soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea × pinnata offers ecological benefits by supporting local pollinator populations and improving habitat diversity.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea × pinnata is a hybrid plant known for its ornamental value and use in garden landscapes.</p>
<p>It has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. While not widely used in culinary applications, it may be incorporated into herbal teas in some cultures. The plant's feathery foliage and vibrant flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>It also holds cultural significance in certain regions, symbolizing resilience and healing.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
