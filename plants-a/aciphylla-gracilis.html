                <h1>Aciphylla gracilis</h1>
<p>Aciphylla gracilis, commonly known as the slender cushion plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its low-growing, dense rosette of silver-gray leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically from December to February. Aciphylla gracilis is adapted to harsh alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, contributing to the unique flora of New Zealand's mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciphylla gracilis has leaves that are narrow, needle-like, and arranged in a rosette pattern, with a bluish-gray color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a grayish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly woody. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered at the top of the stem, blooming in spring and relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a dry, capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla gracilis is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. It is adapted to the harsh conditions of the region, including strong winds and limited rainfall.</p>
<p>Aciphylla gracilis is an important part of the local flora and is often found in association with other native plants in these environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla gracilis was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or rocky soils, typically found in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure, making it well-suited for coastal and inland dunes. This plant is often found in the southern parts of Australia, particularly in Western Australia and South Australia. It plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in rehabilitation projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
