<p>Aira pensylvanica, commonly known as Pennsylvania grass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted culms and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania grass is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
