<p>Agrostis lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Agrostis lusitanica is often found in association with other moisture-loving flora in its native habitat.</p>
