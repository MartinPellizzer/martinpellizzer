                <h1>Adenostegia littoralis</h1>
<p>Adenostegia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal daisy, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates with high salt exposure. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Adenostegia littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostegia littoralis has small, narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when dry, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to stabilize the plant in sandy or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostegia littoralis is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. This plant is commonly found in dunes and beach habitats, playing a vital role in stabilizing coastal dune systems. It is adapted to the harsh conditions of the coastline, including high salinity and frequent disturbance.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution reflects its specialized ecological niche in these unique environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostegia littoralis was mainly introduced to coastal areas along the Pacific coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils near the shoreline, often in areas affected by human activity. This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to changes in local ecosystems, particularly in dune and tidal marsh habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive nature, it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for certain wildlife species.</p>
