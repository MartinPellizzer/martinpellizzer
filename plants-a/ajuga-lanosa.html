                    <h1>Ajuga lanosa</h1>
<p>Ajuga lanosa, commonly known as woolly bugloss, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with soft, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Ajuga lanosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments.</p>
