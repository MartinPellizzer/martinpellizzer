                <h1>Adenosma africana</h1>
<p>Adenosma africana, commonly known as the African adenostema, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological role.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma africana has compound, pinnate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with lanceolate or ovate leaflets that range from 2 to 6 cm in length, and are typically green with a slightly pubescent surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, woody, and covered with a rough, greyish-brown bark that peels off in thin layers. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal racemes, with white or pale yellow petals, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma africana is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands, rocky outcrops, and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in open habitats. It is an herbaceous species with distinctive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the region, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma africana was mainly introduced to new environments as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in various regions, particularly in parts of Africa and the Caribbean. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils have contributed to its spread. However, it is considered invasive in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species.</p>
