                    <h1>Anathallis spathilabia</h1>
<p>Anathallis spathilabia, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, slender stem and showy, pinkish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which cling to tree trunks. Its flowers are typically visited by specific pollinators, such as moths, due to their nocturnal blooming habit.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Anathallis spathilabia is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation interest.</p>
