                    <h1>Agave scolymus var. seemanniana</h1>
<p>Agave scolymus var. seemanniana, commonly known as the dwarf blue agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of thick, blue-gray, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears clusters of small, white flowers, which appear in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
