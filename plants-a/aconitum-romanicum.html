                <h1>Aconitum romanicum</h1>
<p>Aconitum romanicum, commonly known as the Romanish monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple to blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features palmately compound leaves with a distinctive hooded flower structure, typical of the genus Aconitum. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum romanicum has leaves that are compound, with palmate lobes, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure up to 20 cm in diameter; they are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and covered with a rough, bark-like texture, and it is typically grayish-brown in color. The flowers are blue to purple, arranged in racemes, and have a spurred structure; they bloom in late summer, from July to August, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, often forming a dense network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum romanicum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps and the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Austria, Italy, Germany, France, and Romania. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forested areas or along stream banks. Its distribution is closely associated with calcareous soils and temperate climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum romanicum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in Oregon in the 1960s and has since spread to parts of Washington and northern California. The plant is believed to have been introduced through horticultural trade or accidental transport via contaminated soil or plant material. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and has become established in several natural areas.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is now considered a noxious weed in some regions.</p>
