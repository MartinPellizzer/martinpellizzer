<p>Asplenium scolopendrium subsp.</p>
<p>antri-jovis, commonly known as the cave fern, is a rare and specialized fern species adapted to grow in dark, humid cave environments. It possesses a unique morphology, with a compact, often subterranean growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds.</p>
<p>The plant lacks true leaves and instead has specialized structures called rhizomes that anchor it to cave walls or rock surfaces. It reproduces through spores, which are released into the air in the absence of light.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its unusual ecological niche and limited distribution.</p>
