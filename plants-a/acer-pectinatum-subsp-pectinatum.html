                <h1>Acer pectinatum subsp. pectinatum</h1>
<p>Acer pectinatum subsp.</p>
<p>pectinatum, commonly known as the red sanders maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum subsp.</p>
<p>pectinatum has palmately lobed leaves that are typically trifoliate or five-lobed, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stems. The stems are slender and upright, with smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters, and is wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to its preferred moist, well-drained habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum subsp.</p>
<p>pectinatum is a species native to the eastern Himalayas, specifically found in regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. While it was historically distributed across a broader area, its current range is limited to specific high-altitude regions in these countries.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, temperate forests and mountainous areas, often growing in shaded, well-drained soils. This subspecies is typically found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species, requiring conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum subsp.</p>
<p>pectinatum is a striking deciduous tree known for its vibrant red foliage and ornamental value. It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results.</p>
<p>The growth cycle includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions, making it a good companion for plants like lavender or conifers that improve air circulation.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum subsp.</p>
<p>pectinatum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and promoting the growth of other native species. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and offers aesthetic value in natural landscapes.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pectinatum subsp.</p>
<p>pectinatum is a decorative tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage, making it a popular choice in horticulture and landscape design. While its leaves are not typically used in culinary applications, the tree is valued for its aesthetic appeal in parks and gardens.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, some parts of the tree have been used to treat minor ailments, though scientific validation is limited. It also holds cultural significance in regions where it is native, often symbolizing resilience and seasonal change.</p>
<p>Economically, it contributes to the ornamental plant trade, supporting local industries and providing employment opportunities.</p>
