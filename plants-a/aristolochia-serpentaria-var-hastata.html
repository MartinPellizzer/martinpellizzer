                    <h1>Aristolochia serpentaria var. hastata</h1>
<p>Aristolochia serpentaria var. hastata, commonly known as the broadleaf Dutchman's pipe, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves and unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its flowers attract specific pollinators, such as certain flies, due to their mimicry of decaying flesh.</p>
<p>The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been linked to kidney damage, making it important to handle with care.</p>
