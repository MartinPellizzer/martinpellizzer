                <h1>Aciotis trinitensis</h1>
<p>Aciotis trinitensis, commonly known as the Trinidad dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Trinidad and Tobago.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fluffy white seeds for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Aciotis trinitensis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis trinitensis has leaves that are narrow, lanceolate, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in loose inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis trinitensis is primarily native to the Caribbean, specifically the island of Trinidad.</p>
<p>It is found in the northern regions of Trinidad, particularly in the areas around the Paria Peninsula and the northern coastal regions. This plant thrives in coastal and lowland habitats, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It is commonly associated with disturbed or open areas, including roadsides and dry shrublands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis trinitensis was mainly introduced to the Caribbean region, particularly the islands of Trinidad and Tobago.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there through human activity, such as accidental transport via shipping or intentional introduction for ornamental or agricultural purposes. The plant has since established itself in native habitats, often in disturbed areas or along coastal regions. Due to its adaptability, it has spread to other nearby islands, raising concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to increased monitoring to assess its ecological effects.</p>
