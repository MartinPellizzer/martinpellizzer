                <h1>Acer ginnala subsp. semenovii</h1>
<p>Acer ginnala subsp.</p>
<p>semenovii, commonly known as the Semenov's maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, red samaras that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color and unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala subsp.</p>
<p>semenovii has palmately compound leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, measuring approximately 2â€“4 cm in length, and arranged alternately along the stem. The leaves are bright green during the growing season and turn vibrant red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in racemes during late spring, which are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala subsp.</p>
<p>semenovii is a rare subspecies native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, primarily found in countries such as Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Its current distribution is limited and fragmented, with populations occurring in isolated areas of the Tian Shan and Pamir mountain ranges.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in dry, rocky environments, often growing on slopes and in open forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat degradation, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and restore its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala subsp.</p>
<p>semenovii is a hardy, deciduous tree known for its vibrant fall foliage and adaptability to various climates. It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination.</p>
<p>The growth cycle includes a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its ornamental value and promote a balanced ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala subsp.</p>
<p>semenovii is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>It acts as a companion plant in mixed shrublands, enhancing soil stability and preventing erosion. The plant also supports soil health by improving nutrient cycling through its root system.</p>
<p>Overall, it plays a vital ecological role in maintaining habitat diversity and ecosystem balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala subsp.</p>
<p>semenovii is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use but is occasionally used in traditional herbal remedies for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. It has minimal industrial or economic significance due to its small size and limited fruit production.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is appreciated in certain regions for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in local landscaping. Symbolically, it represents resilience and adaptability in some indigenous communities.</p>
<p>However, its applications remain largely niche and underexplored in modern contexts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer ginnala subsp.</p>
<p>semenovii has several popular cultivars such as 'Siberian Maple' and 'Crimson King', which are widely appreciated for their ornamental value. It is also commonly used in hybridization to create new maple varieties with enhanced traits like improved cold hardiness and vivid autumn colors.</p>
<p>Hybrids involving this subspecies often include crosses with other maple species, resulting in plants with unique foliage and growth habits. Due to its attractive leaves and adaptability, it holds significant horticultural importance in landscaping and ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Its versatility makes it a favored choice for both residential and public gardens.</p>
