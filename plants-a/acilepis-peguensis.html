                <h1>Acilepis peguensis</h1>
<p>Acilepis peguensis, commonly known as the Burmese starling tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by fleshy, orange-red fruits. Acilepis peguensis is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis peguensis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops fissures as the plant matures, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and absorbing nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis peguensis is primarily native to Assam, Myanmar, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. The plant thrives in humid, lowland environments with rich soil. It is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic locations in Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis peguensis was mainly introduced to the Southeast Asian region, particularly in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland areas with high humidity and warm climates. The plant has been introduced to various wetlands and swampy environments where it thrives in waterlogged soils. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become an invasive species in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
