<p>Acilepis peguensis, commonly known as the Burmese pittosporum, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pittosporaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>Acilepis peguensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis peguensis has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elliptical to lanceolate leaflets that are medium in size, ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, and have a dark green, glossy upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical and slightly woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exfoliates in thin, flaky layers. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis peguensis is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, specifically found in parts of Myanmar.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations within its native range, primarily in the dry and semi-arid zones of central Myanmar. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops, often near riverbanks. The species typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Acilepis peguensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acilepis peguensis is a rare and ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia, known for its unique foliage and slow growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of Acilepis peguensis is typically slow, with noticeable growth during the warmer months and dormancy in colder seasons.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent moisture without waterlogging. Fertilization during the growing season with a balanced liquid fertilizer and regular pruning to shape the plant are essential for healthy development. It is relatively pest and disease resistant but can be affected by aphids and root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like mint or basil can help repel pests and improve overall garden health.</p>
