<p>Acanthophippium curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's thorned horse-tail, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Equisetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Acanthophippium curtisii is native to specific regions in the United States, particularly in the southeastern states.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
