                <h1>Acer ornatum var. latialatum</h1>
<p>Acer ornatum var. latialatum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely dissected, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. It blooms with small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is primarily due to its striking foliage and elegant tree form.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer ornatum var. latialatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, turning vibrant red or orange in autumn. The stem is straight and upright, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes furrowed with age. It produces small, yellow-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a paired samara with wings that aid in seed dispersal by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread horizontally, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer ornatum var. latialatum is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, particularly in provinces like Sichuan and Yunnan.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it is now found in a few botanical gardens and conservation sites outside its original habitat. This species thrives in temperate climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils along stream sides or in forest understories. It typically occurs at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, where it benefits from cool, humid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat loss, Acer ornatum var. latialatum is considered endangered and requires protection to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer ornatum var. latialatum is a unique variant of the maple tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seed propagation being the most common method. The growth cycle of this plant involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture levels, requiring regular watering during dry spells. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are recommended for healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with scale insects or fungal infections, and it pairs well with companion plants like ferns and hostas in a shaded garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer ornatum var. latialatum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. Its dense root system acts as an effective erosion control plant, stabilizing soil along riverbanks and slopes. The tree also serves as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting a diverse array of flora and fauna.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing habitat for insects and other animals.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer ornatum var. latialatum is a lesser-known maple species primarily valued for its ornamental qualities, making it a popular choice for landscaping and garden design due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas in some cultures. The wood of this plant is not commonly used in industrial applications due to its relatively soft texture and limited availability. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, its main role lies in horticultural and aesthetic purposes rather than in medicinal or economic fields.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer ornatum var. latialatum has several popular cultivars such as 'Crimson King' and 'Orange Crown', which are prized for their vibrant foliage colors.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, leading to cultivars like 'Emerald Queen' and 'Autumn Flame' that exhibit enhanced ornamental traits. These hybrids and cultivars are highly valued in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions. The variety and coloration make them popular choices for landscape design and ornamental planting.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer ornatum var. latialatum plays a significant role in the horticultural industry due to its visual impact and versatility.</p>
