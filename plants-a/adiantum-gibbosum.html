                <h1>Adiantum gibbosum</h1>
<p>Adiantum gibbosum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lyre-shaped fronds that are typically light green with a pale underside. The plant thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Its rhizomes are short and thick, anchoring it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Adiantum gibbosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum gibbosum has fern-like leaves that are finely divided, feather-shaped, and arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a delicate, pale green color and a size ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, light brown bark that grows in a creeping or ascending pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and establish itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum gibbosum is primarily native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. This fern typically grows in moist, shaded environments, including forests and stream banks. It is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest and Andean regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to tropical and subtropical areas within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum gibbosum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, typically found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures, making it suitable for temperate climates. This plant is often found in disturbed soils or areas with partial sunlight, which allows it to spread easily in new habitats. Its introduction has been documented in various parts of the world, including North America and Europe, where it has established itself in natural and cultivated settings.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, Adiantum gibbosum can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
