                <h1>Aconitum rubellum</h1>
<p>Aconitum rubellum, commonly known as the red monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking purple and red flowers that bloom in late summer, forming a helmet-like shape. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum rubellum has palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and has a greyish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in clusters at the top of the stem, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, helping the plant store nutrients and survive in its environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum rubellum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This species is adapted to cold climates and is typically found at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking purple or reddish flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum rubellum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there by horticulturists and gardeners who were interested in its ornamental value. The plant is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and along stream banks. It has become naturalized in some parts of its range, leading to concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>
