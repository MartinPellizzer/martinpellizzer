<p>Acrocomia cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban palm, is a tall, slender palm native to Cuba and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It features a smooth, grayish trunk that can grow up to 20 meters in height. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. Its flowers are small and clustered in branched inflorescences, and it produces edible fruits that are consumed by both wildlife and humans.</p>
<p>The Cuban palm is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocomia cubensis has large, palmate leaves that are typically broad and leathery, with a dark green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem, which is tall and slender with a smooth, grayish bark. The plant produces inflorescences with small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the dry season, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a large, spiny capsule that contains numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb water from deep within the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocomia cubensis is primarily native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba, the Isle of Pines, and the Cayman Islands.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Central America, including southern Mexico, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and lowland forests. It is commonly associated with dry to moist habitats, such as sandy soils near the coast.</p>
<p>Acrocomia cubensis is an important species in local ecosystems and has cultural significance in some regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocomia cubensis was mainly introduced to the Caribbean region, particularly in parts of Cuba and the Florida Keys.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is often cultivated in gardens and used in landscaping due to its attractive palm-like appearance. It has also been introduced to other parts of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>However, its spread outside its native range is limited due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
