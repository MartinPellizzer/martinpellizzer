<p>Alansmia esquiveliana, commonly known as the Mexican ghostflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its delicate, pale yellow flowers that open at dusk. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Alansmia esquiveliana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
