                <h1>Achyranthes lanceolata</h1>
<p>Achyranthes lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist soils along streambanks and wetlands, often forming dense colonies. The plant has slender, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its seeds are dispersed by wind and water, contributing to its wide distribution.</p>
<p>Achyranthes lanceolata is also known for its medicinal uses in traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes lanceolata has lanceolate, alternate leaves that are typically 5-10 cm long and 1-2 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and spread horizontally, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
