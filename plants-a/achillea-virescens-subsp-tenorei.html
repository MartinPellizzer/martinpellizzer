                <h1>Achillea virescens subsp. tenorei</h1>
<p>Achillea virescens subsp.</p>
<p>tenorei, commonly known as the green yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its aromatic foliage and is often found in rocky or limestone soils. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea virescens subsp.</p>
<p>tenorei has narrow, linear leaves that are grass-like in appearance, arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture. The stem is erect, slender, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and a branching growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, clustered in dense cylindrical inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals and a yellow center, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea virescens subsp.</p>
<p>tenorei is a rare flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, specifically found in southern Italy. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations in the Apulia region, where it thrives in rocky and calcareous soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies prefers sunny, open habitats such as slopes and grasslands, often growing in coastal or mountainous areas. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat fragility, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea virescens subsp.</p>
<p>tenorei is a hardy perennial plant known for its attractive, feathery foliage and bright yellow flowers. It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the roots in early spring. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if conditions are too damp.</p>
<p>Companion planting with aromatic herbs like thyme or lavender can help repel pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea virescens subsp.</p>
<p>tenorei is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, which rely on its flowers for sustenance.</p>
<p>This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved soil conditions. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system, which stabilizes soil and prevents runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving habitat structure in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea virescens subsp.</p>
<p>tenorei is a lesser-known plant species primarily found in specific regions of Italy, known for its ornamental value in gardens due to its delicate white flowers. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it may have local traditional uses in certain regions.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties are not well-documented, but like other members of the Asteraceae family, it may possess potential anti-inflammatory or antioxidant benefits. Industrially, it has limited economic importance, though its aesthetic appeal could contribute to horticultural trade.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in local traditions or folklore, though this requires further research.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea virescens subsp.</p>
<p>tenorei has several popular cultivars such as 'Golden Beauty' and 'Variegata', which are prized for their vibrant yellow foliage and dainty white flower heads. It is also frequently used in hybrid breeding programs to develop new varieties with improved hardiness and color variation.</p>
<p>Hybrids involving this subspecies often exhibit enhanced disease resistance and extended bloom periods, making them more adaptable to different climates. Its horticultural importance lies in its ornamental value, particularly in rock gardens and borders where its foliage provides visual interest throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>Due to its unique characteristics, it remains a sought-after plant among gardeners and horticulturalists.</p>
