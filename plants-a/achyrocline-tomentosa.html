                <h1>Achyrocline tomentosa</h1>
<p>Achyrocline tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly achyrocline, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is known for its dense, woolly foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. It typically grows in coastal areas and is often found in sandy or limestone soils.</p>
<p>Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, oval fruits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline tomentosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size, and a dark green color on the upper surface contrasting with a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is covered in a dense layer of fine white hairs, giving it a woolly texture, and it is typically green in color, with a creeping or ascending growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with tubular corollas and five lobes, typically pink to purple in color, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in its often arid habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline tomentosa is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Argentina Northwest, Bolivia, Brazil South, Chile North, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the temperate regions of these South American countries. It thrives in grasslands and open habitats with well-drained soils. The species is adapted to the climate conditions of these regions, including varying levels of precipitation and temperature.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its ecological preferences and historical range across South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline tomentosa was mainly introduced to control invasive weeds in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is native to South America but has been introduced to various regions for its ornamental and ecological benefits. It spreads through seeds dispersed by wind, animals, and water.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native environments.</p>
