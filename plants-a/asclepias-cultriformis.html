                    <h1>Asclepias cultriformis</h1>
<p>Asclepias cultriformis, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. It plays a crucial role in supporting the life cycle of the monarch butterfly, as it is a host plant for their larvae.</p>
<p>Asclepias cultriformis thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments.</p>
