<p>Austroblechnum colensoi, commonly known as Colenso's water fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the ground, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
