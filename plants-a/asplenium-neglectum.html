<p>Asplenium neglectum, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a structure that facilitates spore dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Asplenium neglectum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens with proper humidity and drainage.</p>
