                    <h1>Arachnorchis granitora</h1>
<p>Arachnorchis granitora, commonly known as the granular spider-orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the wet tropical regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features a slender, often branched stem and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, spider-like appearance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks without being parasitic. Its flowers emit a faint fragrance, which helps attract pollinators such as bees and wasps.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in some regions.</p>
