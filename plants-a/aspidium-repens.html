<p>Aspidium repens, commonly known as the running brake, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the ground and form dense mats. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with slender, linear pinnae that are often slightly curled. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
