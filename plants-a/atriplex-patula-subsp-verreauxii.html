<p>Atriplex patula subsp.</p>
<p>verreauxii, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage, which is covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing protection against intense sunlight and water loss.</p>
