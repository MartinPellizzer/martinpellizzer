                <h1>Aechmea andersonii</h1>
<p>Aechmea andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy texture and often display intricate patterns of silver or white. It produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer or early fall.</p>
<p>This plant is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea andersonii has rosette-shaped leaves that are narrow, sword-like, and arranged in a tight spiral around the central stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy texture and can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant has a short, thick stem that is covered in a dense, fibrous bark, and it grows primarily from the base. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix surrounded by modified leaves called bracts, and they bloom in shades of pink and red during the summer months, pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
