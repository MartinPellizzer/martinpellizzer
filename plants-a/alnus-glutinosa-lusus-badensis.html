<p>Alnus glutinosa lusus badensis, commonly known as the Baden sweet alder, is a variant of the sweet alder native to Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, spherical cones that release wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along forest edges.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation, supporting diverse soil microflora and plant communities.</p>
