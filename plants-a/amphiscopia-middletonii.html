                    <h1>Amphiscopia middletonii</h1>
<p>Amphiscopia middletonii, commonly known as the Middletons' bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may extend into the air, facilitating gas exchange.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
