                    <h1>Acrostichum teijsmannianum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum teijsmannianum, commonly known as the giant reed or giant arundo, is a tall, perennial grass native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, fibrous stems that can grow up to 6 meters in height. The plant has long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of hairs. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found near rivers, lakes, and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive.</p>
