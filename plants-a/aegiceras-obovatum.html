                <h1>Aegiceras obovatum</h1>
<p>Aegiceras obovatum, commonly known as the mangrove apple or mangrove fig, is a halophytic tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines. The plant has a distinctive appearance with smooth, dark-barked stems and broad, ovate leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that ripens to a red or orange color, attracting various bird species.</p>
<p>Aegiceras obovatum is also notable for its ability to tolerate saltwater and contribute to the ecological balance of coastal ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiceras obovatum has broad, obovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a spreading, shrub-like pattern. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes, have four petals, and bloom from July to September, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion.</p>
