<p>Aegiceras obovatum, commonly known as the mangrove apple or mangrove fig, is a halophytic tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines. The plant has a distinctive appearance with smooth, dark-barked stems and broad, ovate leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that ripens to a red or orange color, attracting various bird species.</p>
<p>Aegiceras obovatum is also notable for its ability to tolerate saltwater and contribute to the ecological balance of coastal ecosystems.</p>
