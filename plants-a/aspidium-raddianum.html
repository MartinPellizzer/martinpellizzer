<p>Aspidium raddianum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into pinnae with a distinctive, serrated edge. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Aspidium raddianum plays an important role in its ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
