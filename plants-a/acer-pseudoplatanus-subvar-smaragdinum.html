                <h1>Acer pseudoplatanus subvar. smaragdinum</h1>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus subvar. smaragdinum, commonly known as the Emerald Maple, is a variant of the common maple tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking deep green leaves that often exhibit a glossy appearance. This subspecies is native to the western regions of Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and southern France. The leaves are typically larger and more elongated compared to the standard variety, adding to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse in the wind.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus subvar. smaragdinum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stems are smooth and slender, with a pale greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and the plant exhibits an upright growth pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in early spring, arranged in clustered inflorescences, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod, which disperses by wind, allowing the seeds to travel several meters from the parent plant.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus subvar. smaragdinum is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy, particularly in the Dolomites.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the northern Apennines and the Dolomites. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils, typically found in forested slopes and rocky areas. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,200 to 2,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus subvar. smaragdinum is a rare and ornamental maple variety known for its striking emerald-green foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining the desired characteristics. The growth cycle of this plant is relatively slow, with a mature height of up to 10 meters, making it suitable for larger gardens or landscapes.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning should be done in late winter to maintain shape and remove any diseased or dead branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and provide habitat for beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus subvar. smaragdinum is a small, ornamental tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the aesthetic value of the landscape. Its dense root system helps in erosion control, stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration, offering ecological benefits by improving air quality.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus subvar. smaragdinum is a variant of the maple tree known for its ornamental value, often cultivated in gardens and parks for its vibrant foliage.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas. In medicinal contexts, it has been studied for potential antioxidant properties, though its use remains limited. Industrially, it contributes to the horticultural economy by providing aesthetic value in landscaping.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes beauty and resilience, often inspiring art and local identity in regions where it is native.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus subvar. smaragdinum has several popular cultivars such as 'Aureum', known for its golden foliage, and 'Variegatum', which features variegated leaves.</p>
<p>It is also frequently used in hybridization to create ornamental maple varieties with enhanced traits. Hybrids involving this subvariety often display improved cold hardiness and vibrant autumn colors. Its horticultural importance lies in its adaptability to various climates and its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Gardeners and landscapers value it for its unique leaf patterns and seasonal color changes.</p>
