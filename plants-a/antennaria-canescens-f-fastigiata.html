                    <h1>Antennaria canescens f. fastigiata</h1>
<p>Antennaria canescens f. fastigiata, commonly known as the erect form of the whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a compact, mat-forming growth habit with dense, grayish-white foliage that is covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, with a distinctive hairy texture that aids in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>This form is distinguished by its more upright growth compared to the typical spreading habit of the species.</p>
