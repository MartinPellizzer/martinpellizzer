                <h1>Aenigma micranthum</h1>
<p>Aenigma micranthum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate white flowers and lack of leaves, relying entirely on its roots for nutrients. The plant is epiphytic, growing on the bark of trees rather than in soil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique structure and limited distribution make it a subject of botanical interest and conservation concern.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful preservation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aenigma micranthum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a clumping pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical dispersal when the capsule bursts.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, spreading just below the soil surface to absorb moisture and nutrients.</p>
