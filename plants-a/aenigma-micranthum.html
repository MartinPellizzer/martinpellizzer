                    <h1>Aenigma micranthum</h1>
<p>Aenigma micranthum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate white flowers and lack of leaves, relying entirely on its roots for nutrients. The plant is epiphytic, growing on the bark of trees rather than in soil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique structure and limited distribution make it a subject of botanical interest and conservation concern.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful preservation.</p>
