<p>Asclepias reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds attached to silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are usually oval or lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Asclepias reflexa is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
