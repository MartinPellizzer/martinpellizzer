                <h1>Acritopappus santosii</h1>
<p>Acritopappus santosii, commonly known as the Santosii sunflower, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and other composite flowers. The plant is characterized by its yellow-orange ray florets and a central disk of smaller, tubular flowers. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Acritopappus santosii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acritopappus santosii has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 2â€“4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a slightly fibrous texture.

The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means, dispersing them by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid environments where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>

<p>This species is found in the northeastern region of Brazil, where it thrives in specific ecological conditions. It is commonly associated with coastal areas and sandy soils in this region. The plant's distribution is limited to this area, indicating a narrow geographic range.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acritopappus santosii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, waste lands, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and moderate to low moisture levels. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas quickly. Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in many regions where it was accidentally or intentionally introduced.</p>
<p>Its distribution is often associated with human activity, such as land clearing and transportation.</p>
