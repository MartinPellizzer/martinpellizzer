                <h1>Acacia catechu subsp. suma</h1>
<p>Acacia catechu subsp.</p>
<p>suma, commonly known as the Indian blackwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>The plant produces a hard, heavy wood that is highly valued for its density and durability. Its bark and wood contain tannins, which have been traditionally used in dyeing and medicinal applications.</p>
<p>The species is also notable for its role in traditional practices and its ecological importance in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia catechu subsp.</p>
<p>suma has simple, bipinnate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with small, elliptical leaflets that are green in color and measure approximately 2–4 mm in length. The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that exfoliates in thin strips.</p>
<p>The flowers are yellow, clustered in dense cylindrical inflorescences, and bloom from March to May, relying on insect pollination, primarily by bees. The fruit is a pod that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant to anchor itself and access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia catechu subsp.</p>
<p>suma is a shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia, primarily found in countries such as India, Indonesia, and Thailand. Its current distribution includes parts of southern Asia, where it has been introduced in some regions for its medicinal and commercial uses.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks or in open woodlands. This species typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and overharvesting.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia catechu subsp.</p>
<p>suma is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub native to Southeast Asia, commonly grown for its aromatic wood and medicinal properties. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring scarification and stratification for successful germination.</p>
<p>The plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity in 5–7 years, and thrives in well-drained, loamy soil with moderate watering. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to shape the plant and encourage new growth are recommended.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from scale insects or root rot in overly wet conditions, and it benefits from companion planting with herbs like lemongrass or citronella.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acacia catechu subsp.</p>
<p>suma is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its nectar-rich flowers, contributing to ecosystem pollination.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the soil and supporting surrounding vegetation. Its dense root system also helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the land in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Additionally, it serves as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acacia catechu subsp.</p>
<p>suma is a versatile plant with a range of uses and applications. In culinary contexts, its bark is used to make a natural dye and as a flavoring agent in traditional foods.</p>
<p>Medicinally, it has been utilized for its astringent properties to treat ailments such as diarrhea and skin infections. Industrially, the plant's tannins are valuable in the production of leather and ink.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in various regions, often representing strength and resilience.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acacia catechu subsp.</p>
