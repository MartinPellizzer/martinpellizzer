                <h1>Acroblastum insulare</h1>
<p>Acroblastum insulare, commonly known as the island acroblast, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on certain remote islands in the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal or rocky habitats, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and saline conditions.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution and unique ecological niche make it a subject of interest for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acroblastum insulare has leaves that are ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 3 to 8 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, exhibiting a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroblastum insulare is primarily native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is found in various habitats across the archipelago, including coastal areas and dry forests. This plant is endemic to the region, meaning it is not found naturally anywhere else in the world. It thrives in the unique climate and soil conditions of Hawaii.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroblastum insulare was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is believed to have been brought there by human activity, likely through accidental transport on ships or intentional cultivation. The plant has established itself in coastal and disturbed habitats, showing adaptability to the local environment. Despite its introduction, it has not become a major invasive species, though its presence is still monitored.</p>
<p>Its distribution remains limited to specific areas on the islands.</p>
