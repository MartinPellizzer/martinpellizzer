                    <h1>Avicennia officinalis var. acuminata</h1>
<p>Avicennia officinalis var. acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and tidal environments.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The leaves are narrow and have a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss and salt absorption. It thrives in coastal areas, contributing to shoreline stabilization and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in brackish water zones, playing a crucial role in mangrove ecosystems.</p>
