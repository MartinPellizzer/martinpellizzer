<p>Agrostis alba subsp.</p>
<p>gaditana, commonly known as the white oatgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is a perennial species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, typically found in dry, open habitats such as coastal dunes and sandy soils.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. It has adapted to thrive in harsh, arid environments through its drought-resistant traits and efficient water-use mechanisms.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and its potential for use in restoration projects.</p>
