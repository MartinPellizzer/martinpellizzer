                <h1>Adenostemma mauritianum</h1>
<p>Adenostemma mauritianum, commonly known as the Mauritius star grass, is a flowering plant native to the island of Mauritius.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and saline conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered in a radiate head.</p>
<p>Adenostemma mauritianum plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma mauritianum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size and a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough texture and a brownish color, exhibiting an erect growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with a white or pale pink color, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma mauritianum is primarily native to Benin, Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Gulf of Guinea Is., Ivory Coast, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, RÃ©union, Sierra Leone, Sudan-South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.</p>

<p>Adenostemma mauritianum plays a role in the ecological balance of its native regions, supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma mauritianum was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become naturalized in various regions, particularly in the North Island. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have led to concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is now considered a potential weed in some parts of New Zealand.</p>
