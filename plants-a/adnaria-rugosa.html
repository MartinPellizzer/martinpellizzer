                <h1>Adnaria rugosa</h1>
<p>Adnaria rugosa, commonly known as the rough sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny leaves and clusters of blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and rocky environments, often found along shores and cliffs. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Adnaria rugosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria rugosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a rough, waxy texture and a dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes more rugged with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in rocky or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria rugosa is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found along coastal areas and in rocky habitats. This plant thrives in temperate climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. It is often associated with limestone soils and can be seen in both natural and cultivated settings.</p>
<p>Adnaria rugosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other parts of the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria rugosa was mainly introduced to coastal and brackish water environments in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in estuaries, lagoons, and salt marshes where it thrives in saline conditions. This plant plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its introduction has been associated with both ecological benefits and potential invasiveness in certain areas.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native flora and fauna is still under study.</p>
