                    <h1>Athyrium regulare</h1>
<p>Athyrium regulare, commonly known as the common lady fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into multiple segments, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively, while its spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds.</p>
<p>Athyrium regulare is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions.</p>
