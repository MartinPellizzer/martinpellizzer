                <h1>Acis longifolia</h1>
<p>Acis longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf acis, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Acis longifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acis longifolia has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is short and sturdy, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright from the base. Its small, clustered flowers are pale pink to white, consisting of three petals and three sepals, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acis longifolia is primarily native to Corsica.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal and mountainous regions of the island. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in open woodlands and grassy areas. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, white or pinkish flowers.</p>
<p>Acis longifolia is an important part of the local flora and is adapted to the unique climate and terrain of Corsica.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acis longifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. However, it has since become a weed in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. The plant spreads through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>It is now considered a potential threat to native ecosystems in some areas.</p>
