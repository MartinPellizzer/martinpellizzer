                <h1>Acis longifolia</h1>
<p>Acis longifolia, commonly known as the slender bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, seed-like fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Acis longifolia is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and easy care requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acis longifolia has small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a light gray bark that becomes rough with age, growing in a bushy pattern. Its flowers are clustered in umbels, featuring white petals with a yellow center, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acis longifolia is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and environmental changes. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils in open habitats such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and coastal areas. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to approximately 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Acis longifolia is considered to be of conservation concern, with some populations declining due to human activity and habitat degradation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acis longifolia is a delicate flowering plant known for its small, bell-shaped blooms and ornamental value in gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by division of rhizomes, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. The growth cycle of Acis longifolia is typically perennial, with active growth in spring and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape.
