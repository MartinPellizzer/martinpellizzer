                    <h1>Agrostis capensis</h1>
<p>Agrostis capensis, commonly known as Cape grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, coastal dunes, and disturbed soils. The plant has fine, tufted leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is drought-tolerant and can thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
