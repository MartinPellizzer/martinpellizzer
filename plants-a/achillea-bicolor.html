                <h1>Achillea bicolor</h1>
<p>Achillea bicolor, commonly known as the purple yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces flat-topped clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens.</p>
<p>Achillea bicolor is also valued for its historical use in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea bicolor has compound, lance-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green to brownish bark, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are flat-topped umbels composed of small, white and yellow petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, two-lobed achene, with seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea bicolor is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and environmental changes. It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This species typically grows at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from human activity, Achillea bicolor is classified as a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea bicolor is a flowering plant known for its daisy-like blooms and hardy nature, often used in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with division being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a growth cycle that includes a period of active growth in spring, flowering in late summer, and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning after flowering help maintain its health and appearance. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender, yarrow, or echinacea can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
