                <h1>Achillea bicolor</h1>
<p>Achillea bicolor, commonly known as the purple yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with finely divided, fern-like leaves and a distinctive, slightly aromatic scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a range of colors from white to pink and purple.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea bicolor has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, gray-green in color, and arranged in a rosette pattern, with a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and has a smooth, light green bark, growing from the base of the plant. The flowers are compound umbels with white petals and yellow centers, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea bicolor is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>Although it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to specific areas in the Tien Shan and Pamir mountain ranges. It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, often growing in well-drained soils at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, it is considered vulnerable, and its conservation status is of concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea bicolor is a hardy perennial known for its vibrant, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late fall. The growth cycle begins with new growth in spring, flowering in summer, and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while diseases like powdery mildew can occur in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or lavender enhances its beauty and supports beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
