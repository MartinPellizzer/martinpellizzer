                        <h1>Acacia bellula</h1>
<p>Acacia bellula, commonly known as the dwarf acacia, is a small shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia bellula is primarily native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal regions of the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal dunes and fynbos vegetation. It is also present in parts of Namibia and southern Angola.</p>
<p>Acacia bellula is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia bellula was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was initially brought there for ornamental purposes due to its attractive yellow flowers and small size. However, it has since spread rapidly, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is particularly invasive in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on native biodiversity.</p>
