<p>Aspidium medium, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Aspidium medium plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
