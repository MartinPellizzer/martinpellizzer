                <h1>Acrostichum heterophyllum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum heterophyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a member of the family Davalliaceae and is native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, compound leaves that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive arrangement of pinnae that are often broadly ovate.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of ferns.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum heterophyllum has large, broad, pinnately compound leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and fibrous, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a clumping or spreading pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dark blue drupe containing a single seed, which is dispersed by water and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in wet, swampy environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum heterophyllum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of rivers and lakes where there is high moisture. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with disturbed or poorly drained soils. Its distribution includes countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.</p>
<p>It is also occasionally found in the Caribbean islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum heterophyllum was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has established populations in coastal and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, estuaries, and along the edges of freshwater ponds. This plant is often associated with nutrient-rich soils and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for certain wildlife species.</p>
