                    <h1>Aporrhiza talbotii var. gabonensis</h1>
<p>Aporrhiza talbotii var. gabonensis, commonly known as the Gabon mangrove, is a variant of the mangrove species native to coastal regions of Central and West Africa.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as estuaries and tidal mudflats. The plant exhibits specialized adaptations, including salt-excreting glands on its leaves and a complex root system that stabilizes coastal sediments. Its leaves are typically narrow and革质 (leathery), which helps reduce water loss in brackish conditions.</p>
<p>This variant plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystem stability by preventing erosion and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
