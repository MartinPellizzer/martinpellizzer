<p>Acronychia, commonly known as the rough-leaved ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to Australia and New Guinea. The plants are characterized by their rough, often fissured bark and simple, alternate leaves. Acronychia species produce small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>These plants are valued for their hard, durable wood and are often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
