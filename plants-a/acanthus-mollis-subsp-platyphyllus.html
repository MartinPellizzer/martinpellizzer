                <h1>Acanthus mollis subsp. platyphyllus</h1>
<p>Acanthus mollis subsp.</p>
<p>platyphyllus, commonly known as the broadleaf acanthus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Acanthaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive silver-gray appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, spiky inflorescences with small, pale blue or purple flowers. It is native to southern Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
<p>This subspecies is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acanthus mollis subsp.</p>
<p>platyphyllus has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often wavy-margined, arranged oppositely along the stem, and can reach up to 20 cm in length, with a deep green color. The stem is upright and somewhat woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age.</p>
<p>Its flowers are spiky and complex, with purple to reddish bracts that enclose small, yellowish flowers, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind once it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthus mollis subsp.</p>
<p>platyphyllus is a rare and striking plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region, particularly Greece and Turkey. While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including southern Europe and North America, often as an ornamental.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils in full sun, typically found in coastal cliffs and limestone formations. This subspecies grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to about 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered in its native range, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acanthus mollis subsp.</p>
<p>platyphyllus is a striking evergreen perennial known for its velvety silver foliage and dramatic spires of soft pink flowers. It can be propagated through seed or by dividing the rhizomes in early spring. This plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in USDA hardiness zones 7-10, and forms a dense clump over time.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and consistent moisture, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune old leaves in late winter to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by slugs and snails.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or sedum can enhance its appearance and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
