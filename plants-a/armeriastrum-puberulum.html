<p>Armeriastrum puberulum, commonly known as silverleaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens.</p>
