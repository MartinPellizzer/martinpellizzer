<p>Androsace villosa f. genuina, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, woolly foliage that helps insulate it against cold temperatures and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
