                    <h1>Anacamptis morio f. albicans</h1>
<p>Anacamptis morio f. albicans, commonly known as the white marsh orchid, is a rare and striking variant of the common marsh orchid.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost white flowers, which contrast sharply with the usual greenish-yellow of the species. This orchid is native to parts of Europe and is often found in wet meadows and marshy habitats. Its botanical features include long, slender leaves and a single, erect stem bearing a cluster of showy flowers.</p>
<p>The f. albicans form is distinguished by its reduced pigmentation, making it a unique and sought-after plant in botanical collections.</p>
