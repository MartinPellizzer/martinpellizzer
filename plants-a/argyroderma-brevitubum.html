                    <h1>Argyroderma brevitubum</h1>
<p>Argyroderma brevitubum, commonly known as the short-tubed silverleaf.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often in rocky or sandy soils. Its silver-gray foliage is a result of dense pubescence covering the leaves.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
