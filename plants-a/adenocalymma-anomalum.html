                <h1>Adenocalymma anomalum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma anomalum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, lantern-shaped inflorescence that appears to glow in the dark, a feature that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that emit a faint bioluminescent effect, though this is not true light but a result of reflected moonlight. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered an important species for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma anomalum has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that remains relatively unbranched. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers with four petals, blooming during the cooler months and relying on wind for pollination. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma anomalum is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal regions of the Eastern Cape Province. This species thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline. It is commonly observed in the vicinity of the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to a relatively small area within this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma anomalum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun exposure and well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found in regions with a temperate to subtropical climate. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several non-native regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
