                <h1>Aconitum tawangense</h1>
<p>Aconitum tawangense, commonly known as Tawang Aconite, is a perennial herb native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers. The plant features a stout, hairy stem that bears alternate, palmately compound leaves. Its roots are tuberous and contain potent alkaloids, making it toxic.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum tawangense has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are broadly ovate to reniform in shape, with a deep green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, typically blue-green in color, with a smooth, slightly rough bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, arranged in racemes, with showy, spurred petals and a long nectar spur, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous, thick and fleshy, adapted for storing nutrients and water in its native high-altitude environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum tawangense is primarily native to the East Himalaya.</p>
<p>This species is found in the mountainous regions of northeastern India, particularly in the states of Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim. It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically between 2,000 and 3,500 meters above sea level. The plant is commonly found in forested areas and rocky slopes, where it benefits from the cool and moist climate.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum tawangense was mainly introduced to the eastern Himalayas, particularly in the Tawang region of Arunachal Pradesh, India.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded areas such as forest margins and rocky slopes. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems and striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.</p>
