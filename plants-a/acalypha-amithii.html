<p>Acalypha amithii, commonly known as the golden torch plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its striking, bright yellow bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. These bracts are often mistaken for petals and give the plant its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Acalypha amithii thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha amithii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a smooth texture. The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with greenish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous, helping the plant anchor in moist soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
