                    <h1>Asplenium terrestre</h1>
<p>Asplenium terrestre, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a small, non-vascular fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows close to the ground, often found in rocky crevices or on the forest floor. The plant has slender, dark green fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium terrestre plays a minor but important role in soil stabilization and microhabitat creation in its native ecosystems.</p>
