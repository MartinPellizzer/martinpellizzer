                <h1>Acer saccharophorum var. rugelii</h1>
<p>Acer saccharophorum var. rugelii, commonly known as the rugel maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 20–30 meters and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and urban forestry.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer saccharophorum var. rugelii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring, with a simple structure and wind as the primary pollination method. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer saccharophorum var. rugelii is a rare maple species native to the eastern United States, specifically found in parts of Tennessee and North Carolina.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other regions, including parts of Europe and Asia, where it is cultivated in botanical gardens. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils in temperate forests and is typically found at altitudes between 600 and 1,200 meters. Due to its restricted habitat and limited population size, it is considered endangered or critically endangered in its native range.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve this unique variant in its natural environment.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer saccharophorum var. rugelii is a slow-growing, ornamental maple known for its vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering during dry spells, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic value in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer saccharophorum var. rugelii is a valuable ornamental tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in landscaping, enhancing aesthetic value while supporting ecological balance. Its deep roots help in erosion control, stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and supporting a diverse range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer saccharophorum var. rugelii is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use but is valued in ornamental horticulture for its unique foliage and structural beauty.</p>
<p>While it does not have a significant role in traditional medicine, it may be used in modern herbal preparations due to its potential antioxidant properties. The tree contributes to local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for wildlife, supporting biodiversity in forested areas. In cultural contexts, it may symbolize resilience and natural beauty, especially in regions where it is native.</p>
<p>Its ecological role in carbon sequestration and soil stabilization also makes it relevant in environmental conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer saccharophorum var. rugelii has several popular cultivars, including 'Autumnalis' and 'Crimson King,' which are prized for their vibrant fall color and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, such as *Acer palmatum*, to produce ornamental varieties with unique foliage patterns and enhanced cold hardiness. These hybrids often exhibit improved adaptability to different climates and soil conditions, making them more widely cultivated in gardens. The horticultural importance of *Acer saccharophorum var. rugelii* lies in its aesthetic value and versatility, contributing to landscape design with its striking autumn displays.</p>
<p>Its use in urban and suburban settings further highlights its significance in modern horticulture.</p>
