                    <h1>Ajuga rhodopea</h1>
<p>Ajuga rhodopea, commonly known as the Greek bugleweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, low-growing mats of dark green foliage with small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright blue to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick carpets, which can help suppress weeds and prevent soil erosion.</p>
