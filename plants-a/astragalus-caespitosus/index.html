                            <h1>Astragalus Caespitosus</h1>
<p>Astragalus caespitosus is a small, flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is commonly known as the tufted milkvetch and belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae. This species is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
