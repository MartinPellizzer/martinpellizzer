                    <h1>Arenaria canescens</h1>
<p>Arenaria canescens, commonly known as sand pink, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Arenaria canescens is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal sands, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
