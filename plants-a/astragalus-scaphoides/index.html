                            <h1>Astragalus Scaphoides</h1>
<p>Astragalus scaphoides is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This species is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers and slender stems that thrive in rocky habitats. It is often found in alpine meadows and open woodlands at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental needs, Astragalus scaphoides is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
