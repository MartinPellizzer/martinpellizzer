                    <h1>Aira humilis</h1>
<p>Aira humilis, commonly known as the common hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with slender, hair-like leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Aira humilis is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators.</p>
