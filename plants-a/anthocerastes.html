                    <h1>Anthocerastes</h1>
<p>Anthocerastes, commonly known as the horned liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the order Marchantiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and the presence of distinct, horn-like reproductive structures called archegonia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Anthocerastes has a simple yet efficient system for absorbing water and nutrients from its surroundings.</p>
<p>Its morphology and reproductive features make it an important component of early successional ecosystems.</p>
