<p>Aira rara, commonly known as the rare grass or slender aira, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. It has a fibrous root system and produces seeds in slender, spike-like clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aira rara is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
