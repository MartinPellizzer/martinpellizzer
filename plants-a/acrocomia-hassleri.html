                <h1>Acrocomia hassleri</h1>
<p>Acrocomia hassleri, commonly known as the Hassler's palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Mexico and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white inflorescences that bear small, clustered fruits. Acrocomia hassleri is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its elegant appearance and resilience.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocomia hassleri has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate to ovate leaflets that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a spiny, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release three winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocomia hassleri is primarily native to Brazil West-Central and Paraguay.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It typically grows in open forests and savannas. The species is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its ecological preferences and historical range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocomia hassleri was mainly introduced to the Caribbean islands, particularly Cuba and the Bahamas, as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability.</p>
<p>It has since been found growing in other regions of the West Indies, including parts of Jamaica and Hispaniola. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often establishing itself in disturbed or coastal habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native environments.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, its ecological impact remains under study in the areas where it has become naturalized.</p>
