                    <h1>Acrostichum yatesii</h1>
<p>Acrostichum yatesii, commonly known as the Florida leather Fern, is a rare and endangered fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its wetland habitats. The plant typically grows in swamps and marshes, where it thrives in the humid, shaded conditions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Acrostichum yatesii is critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
