                <h1>Achyrocalyx gossypinus</h1>
<p>Achyrocalyx gossypinus, commonly known as the cottonwood tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, warm climates. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, fluffy seeds, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The tree is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocalyx gossypinus has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that exhibits a twining growth pattern, often climbing or trailing along supports. Its flowers are small, clustered in axillary inflorescences, featuring five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in disturbed or open habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocalyx gossypinus is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid lowland areas with rich soil and adequate rainfall. This plant is commonly found in the Amazon rainforest and adjacent savanna regions. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is often associated with secondary growth habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to these specific ecological zones within the continent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocalyx gossypinus was mainly introduced to the region of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is often found in lowland and coastal areas, thriving in humid and tropical climates. The plant is commonly associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges. Its introduction has been linked to human activities, including trade and accidental dispersal through agricultural practices.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some areas, posing a threat to native flora.</p>
