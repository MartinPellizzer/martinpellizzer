                    <h1>Aralia ornata</h1>
<p>Aralia ornata, commonly known as the white woodbine, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by bright red berries that attract birds. Its root system is fibrous and can spread widely, making it somewhat invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>Aralia ornata thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, wooded areas.</p>
