The plant produces yellow flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Aloe tenuior is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its leaves contain a gel that is sometimes used for topical applications, though it is less commonly utilized than other aloe species.</p>
