                    <h1>Asparagus glaucus</h1>
<p>Asparagus glaucus, commonly known as the silver asparagus, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive silver-gray appearance. The plant produces small, white to green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, needle-like spears that are harvested before they fully elongate. Asparagus glaucus thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant suitable for rock gardens or borders.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
