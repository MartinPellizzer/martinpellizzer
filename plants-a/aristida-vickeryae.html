<p>Aristida vickeryae, commonly known as Vickery's threeawn, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and distinctive, three-awned lemma structures. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It produces small, pale green to brownish inflorescences that are adapted to disperse seeds efficiently in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
