<p>Argythamnia tricuspidata var. genuina, commonly known as the desert sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapting well to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are edible for both humans and animals. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food in desert ecosystems.</p>
