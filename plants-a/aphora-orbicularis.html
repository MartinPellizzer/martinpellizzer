                    <h1>Aphora orbicularis</h1>
<p>Aphora orbicularis, commonly known as the roundleaf aphora, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its orbicular, or nearly circular, leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. Its succulent stems allow it to store water, enabling it to survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>Aphora orbicularis is often found growing in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, where it thrives with minimal water and full sun exposure.</p>
