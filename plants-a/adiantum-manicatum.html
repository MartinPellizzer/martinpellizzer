                <h1>Adiantum manicatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum manicatum, commonly known as the southern maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green with a slight metallic sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantum manicatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum manicatum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with finely divided, delicate fronds that are typically 20â€“30 cm long.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green, glossy, and arranged in a bipinnate pattern, giving the plant a lacy appearance. The stems are slender, upright, and often branched, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively inconspicuous. This plant is typically sterile and does not produce flowers, so it lacks flowering structures, color, blooming period, or pollination method.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and anchor itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum manicatum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This fern thrives in forest understories and along stream banks, where it benefits from high humidity and partial sunlight. Its distribution extends to parts of the Indian subcontinent, including India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Adiantum manicatum is also present in some regions of Australia, particularly in the northern territories.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum manicatum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become naturalized in various regions. The plant is commonly found in damp, shaded areas such as forest floors and stream sides. It has spread through both natural means and human activity.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is considered a potential weed in some areas.</p>
