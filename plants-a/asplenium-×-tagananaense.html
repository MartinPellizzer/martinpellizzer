<p>Asplenium × tagananaense, commonly known as the Taganana spleenwort, is a hybrid fern species native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow in dense clusters. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread along rocky or shaded surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangs, are found on the underside of its leaves, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
