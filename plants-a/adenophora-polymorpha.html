                <h1>Adenophora polymorpha</h1>
<p>Adenophora polymorpha, commonly known as the variable bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats.</p>
<p>Adenophora polymorpha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its beauty and resilience.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora polymorpha has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, often branched, and have a rough, hairy texture, with a reddish-brown color that becomes darker as the plant matures. The flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in umbels, and are typically pink to purple in color, blooming from late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping the plant to anchor and absorb moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora polymorpha is primarily native to East Asia, including regions such as China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous areas and forested regions where the climate is temperate. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or gravelly habitats. It is particularly prevalent in the northeastern parts of China, such as Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces.</p>
<p>Adenophora polymorpha is an important species in the flora of these regions and is often found in meadows and open woodlands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora polymorpha was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often in regions where it can thrive as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides in parts of North America, particularly in the northeastern and western United States. This plant spreads through seeds dispersed by wind, water, and animals, contributing to its widespread distribution. Due to its adaptability, it has become naturalized in several regions beyond its native range.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
