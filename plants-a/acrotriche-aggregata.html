                <h1>Acrotriche aggregata</h1>
<p>Acrotriche aggregata, commonly known as the clustered acrotriche, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Acrotriche aggregata is adapted to survive in dry environments, with deep roots and a low-growing habit to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky soils and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotriche aggregata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically gray to brown in color. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotriche aggregata is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland in Australia.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils. It thrives in the temperate to subtropical climates of these regions. Acrotriche aggregata is often associated with dunes and open heathland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within these two states.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotriche aggregata was mainly introduced to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion in coastal areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the Atlantic coast of South America. This plant thrives in harsh, saline environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its deep root system helps bind the soil, making it valuable for dune stabilization.</p>
<p>However, it can sometimes become invasive if not managed properly.</p>
