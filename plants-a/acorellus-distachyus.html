                <h1>Acorellus distachyus</h1>
<p>Acorellus distachyus, commonly known as the two-stamened acorellus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fruits are dry, two-lobed schizocarps, which disperse seeds through wind.</p>
<p>Acorellus distachyus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorellus distachyus has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorellus distachyus is primarily native to South America, specifically the Andean region.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. This plant grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. It is adapted to the cool and humid conditions of the Andes.</p>
<p>Its natural range is limited to these specific ecological zones within the continent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorellus distachyus was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought in for its ornamental value due to its attractive, palm-like foliage. The plant has since spread beyond its initial introduction sites, becoming established in wetland and riparian habitats. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to monitor and control its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
