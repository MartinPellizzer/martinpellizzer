                    <h1>Asclepias cancellata</h1>
<p>Asclepias cancellata, commonly known as the zigzag milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Asclepias cancellata plays a vital role in supporting pollinators and is a key species in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
