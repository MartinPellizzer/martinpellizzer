<p>Asterolasia trymalioides subsp.</p>
<p>areniticola, commonly known as the coastal asterolasia, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal or inland dune environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to harsh, dry conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
