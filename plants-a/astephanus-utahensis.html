                    <h1>Astephanus utahensis</h1>
<p>Astephanus utahensis, commonly known as the Utah stephanus, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Utah and neighboring states.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowering stems bear small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Astephanus utahensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying desert flora.</p>
