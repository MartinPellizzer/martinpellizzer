<p>Anoectochilus kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact, rosette-like growth habit, characterized by its fleshy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often arranged in a spike. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity and is adapted to the unique microclimate of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
