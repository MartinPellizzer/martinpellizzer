                <h1>Aciphylla hectori</h1>
<p>Aciphylla hectori, commonly known as Hector's New Zealand spinach, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, berry-like fruits. It is well adapted to rocky and coastal habitats, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often found in conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciphylla hectori has small, needle-like leaves that are tightly clustered at the base of the plant, giving it a compact appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The stem is short and thick, often covered in a rough, greyish-brown bark that provides protection against harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal, allowing the plant to spread in open, dry habitats.</p>
