                    <h1>Aspalathus cretica</h1>
<p>Aspalathus cretica, commonly known as the Cape chestnut, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are dark green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by the development of hard, chestnut-like fruits. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Aspalathus cretica is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
