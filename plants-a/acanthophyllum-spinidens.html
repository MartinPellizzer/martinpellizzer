                        <h1>Acanthophyllum spinidens</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum spinidens, commonly known as the spiny broomweed, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by dry, papery fruits. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Acanthophyllum spinidens plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthophyllum spinidens is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and China.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in steppes and deserts. This plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, such as high temperatures and low precipitation. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the ecological zones characterized by extreme climatic conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthophyllum spinidens was mainly introduced to areas with arid and semi-arid conditions, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with low precipitation and high solar exposure, such as deserts and shrublands. This plant is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a pioneer species in disturbed or degraded habitats. Its introduction has been documented in several regions outside its native range, including parts of North America and Australia.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it can sometimes outcompete native vegetation, raising concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
