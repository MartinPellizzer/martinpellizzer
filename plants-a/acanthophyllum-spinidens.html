<p>Acanthophyllum spinidens, commonly known as the spiny broomweed, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by dry, papery fruits. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Acanthophyllum spinidens plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
