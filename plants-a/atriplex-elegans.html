<p>Atriplex elegans, commonly known as silverleaf chenopod, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its seed capsules are typically three-angled and ribbed. Atriplex elegans is adapted to thrive in saline and alkaline soils, making it a common component of desert and coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
