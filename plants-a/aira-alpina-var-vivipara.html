                    <h1>Aira alpina var. vivipara</h1>
<p>Aira alpina var. vivipara, commonly known as the alpine air grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. One of its notable botanical features is its ability to produce viviparous seeds, which can germinate while still attached to the parent plant.</p>
<p>This trait enhances its survival in harsh alpine environments where seed dispersal is challenging.</p>
