<p>Agrostis anadyrensis, commonly known as the Armenian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant has slender,丛生 (clump-forming) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Agrostis anadyrensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fine texture and ability to thrive in cooler climates.</p>
