                    <h1>Alopecurus crypsoides</h1>
<p>Alopecurus crypsoides, commonly known as the creeping hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground, often in moist or wet habitats such as meadows, ditches, and marshes. The plant has fine, hair-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily and form extensive colonies.</p>
<p>Alopecurus crypsoides is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
