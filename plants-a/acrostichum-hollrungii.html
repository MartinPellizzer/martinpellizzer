                <h1>Acrostichum hollrungii</h1>
<p>Acrostichum hollrungii, commonly known as the hollrung's fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a light green color and a finely divided structure.</p>
<p>Acrostichum hollrungii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum hollrungii has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth, waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a creeping growth pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the late spring, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds through wind when it splits open.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping it to spread and colonize moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum hollrungii is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland environments, often found near coastal areas and in dense tropical rainforests. This plant is commonly associated with mangrove ecosystems and brackish water habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing shorelines. It is also found in swampy and marshy areas, where it tolerates varying salinity levels.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum hollrungii was mainly introduced to wetland and riparian areas where it can thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed sites such as along stream banks, lake edges, and floodplains. This plant is known for its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native species in certain regions.</p>
