                    <h1>Asplenium × bernardii</h1>
<p>Asplenium × bernardii, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a fern species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the appearance of the parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Asplenium × bernardii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in controlled indoor settings.</p>
