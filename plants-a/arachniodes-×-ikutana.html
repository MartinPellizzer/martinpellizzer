                    <h1>Arachniodes × ikutana</h1>
<p>Arachniodes × ikutana, commonly known as the spider fern, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Arachniodes felix-malfoy and Arachniodes standleyi.</p>
<p>It is a fern characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that resemble the delicate patterns of a spider's web. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, thriving in humid, shaded environments such as tropical forests. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This rare and exotic species is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ecological significance.</p>
