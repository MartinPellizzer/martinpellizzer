                <h1>Acrostichum fluviatile</h1>
<p>Acrostichum fluviatile, commonly known as the river fern, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that float on the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize the soil and prevent erosion. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Acrostichum fluviatile plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum fluviatile has broad, feather-like leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, arranged in a pinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows horizontally along the ground. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer, which are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a spore-bearing capsule that disperses spores through wind, and the plant has fibrous roots that help anchor it in moist soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum fluviatile is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of rivers and lakes. This plant thrives in warm, humid climates with abundant moisture and partial to full sunlight. It is often associated with disturbed or nutrient-rich soils in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Acrostichum fluviatile plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum fluviatile was mainly introduced to aquatic and riparian habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in areas with standing or flowing water. This plant is often associated with disturbed sites and can colonize areas with high water tables. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various regions, sometimes competing with native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can spread rapidly in suitable conditions, making it an invasive species in some areas.</p>
