                    <h1>Acrostichum fluviatile</h1>
<p>Acrostichum fluviatile, commonly known as the river fern, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that float on the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize the soil and prevent erosion. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Acrostichum fluviatile plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
