                            <h1>Austrobuxus Swainii</h1>
<p>Austrobuxus swainii is a rare evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Buxaceae and is known for its dense, leathery leaves and compact growth habit. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in understorey layers of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
