                <h1>Aegiphila spicata</h1>
<p>Aegiphila spicata, commonly known as the Chilean ironwood, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has thick, leathery leaves that help it conserve water in its arid habitat. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Aegiphila spicata is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila spicata has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size and a dull green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a pale greenish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white to pale pink petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry, rocky soils in which the plant typically grows.</p>
