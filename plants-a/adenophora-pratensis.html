                <h1>Adenophora pratensis</h1>
<p>Adenophora pratensis, commonly known as meadow bellflower, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped blue to purple flowers in late summer. Its flowers are clustered in umbels, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
<p>Adenophora pratensis is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora pratensis has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement, ranging from 2 to 6 centimeters in length, and are typically clustered at the base of the plant. The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a slightly hairy texture and a light green to reddish-brown color, growing from a basal rosette of leaves. Its flowers are bell-shaped, arranged in clusters, and are pale blue to purple in color, blooming from July to August, and are pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, capsule that contains small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora pratensis is primarily native to Inner Mongolia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands and open habitats within this region. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is an important component of the local flora in the area.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the northern parts of Inner Mongolia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora pratensis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, temperate climates, typically found in meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in regions with moderate temperatures and sufficient rainfall. This plant is commonly distributed in the northern hemisphere, particularly in Europe and parts of Asia. Its introduction to new regions is often associated with human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become naturalized in several non-native areas where it can compete with local flora.</p>
