<p>Androsace magellanica, commonly known as the Magellan's rock白菜, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southern tip of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
