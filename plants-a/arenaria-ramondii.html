<p>Arenaria ramondii, commonly known as Ramond's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in arid environments.</p>
<p>Arenaria ramondii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry landscapes.</p>
