                <h1>Acianthera crassilabia</h1>
<p>Acianthera crassilabia, commonly known as the broad-lipped acianthera, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and possesses showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant features a sympodial growth pattern, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette-like formation.</p>
<p>Acianthera crassilabia is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera crassilabia has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a pale greenish-brown color, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and a prominent yellowish throat, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera crassilabia is primarily native to Costa Rica.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the foothills and lowland areas. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the cloud forests and rainforests. The plant is known for its small, fragrant flowers and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera crassilabia was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded habitats, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high humidity and well-drained soil, often found in forest understories. This plant is commonly introduced to regions where its native range includes parts of South America, such as Brazil and Peru. It has been noted in some introduced populations in the southeastern United States and parts of Australia.</p>
<p>Its introduction is often associated with horticultural trade and accidental dispersal through human activities.</p>
