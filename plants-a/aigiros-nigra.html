                    <h1>Aigiros nigra</h1>
<p>Aigiros nigra, commonly known as black mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in saline and tidal environments. The plant has specialized roots that help filter salt from the water, allowing it to survive in brackish conditions. Its leaves are typically small, thick, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Aigiros nigra plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
