                    <h1>Arum cilicicum</h1>
<p>Arum cilicicum, commonly known as the Cyprus arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers surrounded by a spadix, which is characteristic of the Araceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Arum cilicicum is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats across its native range.</p>
