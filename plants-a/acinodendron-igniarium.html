<p>Acinodendron igniarium, commonly known as the flameleaf acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in hard pods, which split open when mature to release the seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it is often used in reforestation and land restoration projects.</p>
