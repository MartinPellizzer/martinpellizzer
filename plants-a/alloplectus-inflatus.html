<p>Alloplectus inflatus, commonly known as the inflated bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, still freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the bladders are the primary photosynthetic organs.</p>
<p>Alloplectus inflatus is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the digestion of trapped prey for survival.</p>
