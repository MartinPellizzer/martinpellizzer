<p>Anacamptis pyramidalis var. tanayensis, commonly known as the Tanay pyramidal orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pyramidal inflorescence composed of numerous violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while the roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
