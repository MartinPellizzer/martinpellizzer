                <h1>Actinocephalus phaeocephalus</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus phaeocephalus, commonly known as the black-headed daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive dark purple to black central flower head. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow ray florets surrounding the central disc. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Actinocephalus phaeocephalus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus phaeocephalus has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical and slightly woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with yellow petals and a greenish calyx, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus phaeocephalus is primarily native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern and southern regions of the country. This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. It is commonly associated with coastal and inland areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus phaeocephalus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, star-shaped flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in coastal and lowland regions.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
