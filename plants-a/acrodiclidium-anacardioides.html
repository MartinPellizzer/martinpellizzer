                <h1>Acrodiclidium anacardioides</h1>
<p>Acrodiclidium anacardioides, commonly known as the African sumach, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other plants like the cashew and poison ivy. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. Its fruit is a three-lobed drupe, often containing a single seed.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrodiclidium anacardioides has simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are glossy green in color, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that has a slightly fibrous texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, blooming during the summer months, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted for efficient water absorption in dry environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrodiclidium anacardioides is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with humid climates and well-drained soils. This plant thrives in lowland forests and along riverbanks, where it benefits from ample sunlight and moisture. It is often seen as a shrub or small tree, adapting well to various soil types in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in ornamental gardens in warmer regions outside its natural range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrodiclidium anacardioides was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage. The plant has since become naturalized in several tropical regions. It thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to invade native ecosystems.</p>
