                <h1>Aegialina pumila</h1>
<p>Aegialina pumila, commonly known as the beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in sandy, salt-tolerant environments. The plant produces striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are sprawling and vine-like.</p>
<p>Aegialina pumila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune soils and providing habitat for small insects and birds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegialina pumila has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with five petals, blooming in spring and relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy coastal soils.</p>
