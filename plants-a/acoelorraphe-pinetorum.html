                <h1>Acoelorraphe pinetorum</h1>
<p>Acoelorraphe pinetorum, commonly known as the Florida panhandle bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Bladderwort family (Peltogynioideae) and is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures used for trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and pond margins. It has slender, branching stems with small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptations make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoelorraphe pinetorum has leaves that are simple, lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a light brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoelorraphe pinetorum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas, including marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds and lakes. This plant thrives in moist to aquatic environments and is often associated with pine flatwoods and cypress swamps. It plays an important role in the ecological balance of these wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the availability of water and the specific soil conditions found in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoelorraphe pinetorum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas with sandy soils and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It was originally from the Caribbean and parts of South America, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. This plant was introduced for its ornamental value, especially its bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. However, it has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have made it a concern for environmental management in invaded areas.</p>
