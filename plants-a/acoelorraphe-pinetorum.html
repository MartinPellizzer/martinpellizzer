                    <h1>Acoelorraphe pinetorum</h1>
<p>Acoelorraphe pinetorum, commonly known as the Florida panhandle bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Bladderwort family (Peltogynioideae) and is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures used for trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and pond margins. It has slender, branching stems with small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptations make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
