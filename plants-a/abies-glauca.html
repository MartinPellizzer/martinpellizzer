                        <h1>Abies glauca</h1>
<p>Abies glauca, commonly known as the blue spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and its striking blue-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The needles are sharp, four-sided, and have a waxy coating that contributes to its distinctive color. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in full sun to partial shade.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies glauca is primarily native to North America, specifically the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as the Rocky Mountains, the Sierra Nevada, and the Pacific Northwest. This species thrives in high-elevation environments, often growing in subalpine or alpine zones. It is commonly associated with cold and dry climates, preferring well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Abies glauca is an important component of boreal and subalpine forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies glauca was mainly introduced to areas with cold, moist climates, particularly in mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in forested landscapes. This species is often planted for its ornamental value due to its striking blue-green needles and cone production. It has been introduced to parts of Europe and Asia as well, where it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as an ornamental tree.</p>
<p>However, its introduction outside its native range is limited due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
