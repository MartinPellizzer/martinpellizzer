                <h1>Acmena graveolens</h1>
<p>Acmena graveolens, commonly known as the sour cherry or cherry gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and often have a reddish or purple tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. The berries are edible but have a tart, acidic flavor, making them popular in culinary uses.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry woodland habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena graveolens has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stems are smooth and slightly woody, with a pale grey-brown bark that peels in thin, vertical strips. The flowers are small, white or cream-colored, clustered in inflorescences, and bloom from late winter to early spring, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a spherical, fleshy drupe that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena graveolens is primarily native to eastern and northeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory. This plant typically grows in subtropical and tropical rainforests, often in moist, shaded areas. It is commonly associated with rocky or sandy soils in these regions.</p>
<p>Acmena graveolens is an important component of the local flora and is often used in horticulture due to its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena graveolens was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. The plant is commonly found in gardens and along riverbanks, where it can spread into native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, management efforts are underway to control its spread and prevent ecological harm.</p>
