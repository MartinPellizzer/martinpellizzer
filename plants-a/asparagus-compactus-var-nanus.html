                    <h1>Asparagus compactus var. nanus</h1>
<p>Asparagus compactus var. nanus, commonly known as dwarf asparagus, is a compact, low-growing plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, scale-like leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray in color. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and minimal maintenance requirements.</p>
