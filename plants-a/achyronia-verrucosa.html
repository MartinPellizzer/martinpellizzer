                <h1>Achyronia verrucosa</h1>
<p>Achyronia verrucosa, commonly known as the warty achyronia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive warty leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often covered in small, raised bumps, giving them a textured appearance.</p>
<p>The flowers are clustered in racemes and are pollinated primarily by insects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia verrucosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth, waxy surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 5 to 10 cm in length, typically displaying a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and slightly hairy, with a light brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia verrucosa is primarily native to the southern United States, particularly Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of swamps where there is abundant moisture. This plant thrives in sandy or peaty soils and is often associated with coastal areas. It plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitats by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia verrucosa was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as trade and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has established itself in regions with similar climatic conditions to its native range. The plant's ability to thrive in disturbed soils has contributed to its spread in non-native areas. It is commonly found in urban environments and along roadsides.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
