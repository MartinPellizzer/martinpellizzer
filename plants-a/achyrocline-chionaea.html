                <h1>Achyrocline chionaea</h1>
<p>Achyrocline chionaea, commonly known as the white cloud flower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a cloud-like appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Achyrocline chionaea is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline chionaea has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy lower surface, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length and 1 to 2 cm in width, and they are usually dark green in color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and slightly hairy, with a light green to pale yellowish bark that remains smooth throughout its growth. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale blue petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind, with each seed being small and winged to aid in aerial distribution.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soils where the plant typically grows.</p>
