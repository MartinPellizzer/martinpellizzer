                    <h1>Annona nana var. katangensis</h1>
<p>Annona nana var. katangensis, commonly known as the Katanga cherimoya, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Annonaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and fragrant, white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are similar in appearance to cherimoyas but have a unique, creamy-white pulp. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species.</p>
