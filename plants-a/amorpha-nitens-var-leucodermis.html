                    <h1>Amorpha nitens var. leucodermis</h1>
<p>Amorpha nitens var. leucodermis, commonly known as the white-leaf false indigo, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered with a fine, white pubescence, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable plant for dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is less common than the typical form of Amorpha nitens and is often found in woodland edges and open fields.</p>
