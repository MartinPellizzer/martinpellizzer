                <h1>Adansonia grandidieri</h1>
<p>Adansonia grandidieri, commonly known as the Royal Palm, is a striking endemic species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is a tall, slender tree that can grow up to 25 meters in height, characterized by its long, pinnate leaves and distinctive, clustered flower clusters. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces large, fibrous fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a symbol of Madagascar's biodiversity and a flagship species for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adansonia grandidieri has large, thick, waxy leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, and range from 30 to 60 centimeters in length, with a dark green color.</p>
<p>Its stem is thick and woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grayish-brown in color, and it grows as a tree with a broad, rounded crown. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are yellow with a red throat, arranged in clusters, blooming between December and February, and are pollinated by bats and insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to survive in arid conditions by accessing underground water.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adansonia grandidieri is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the island, particularly in the southern and southwestern parts. This species thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is commonly seen in the spiny forests of the region. It is also known as the baobab tree and is an important part of Madagascar's unique flora.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it faces threats to its native distribution.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adansonia grandidieri was mainly introduced to Madagascar, where it is native and thrives in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the spiny forests of the south-western part of the island, particularly around the town of Tulear. This species is well adapted to the harsh climate and is a key component of the local ecosystem. It is also known as the "baobab tree" and holds cultural significance for the local people.</p>
<p>Due to its unique characteristics, it is often studied for its ecological and conservation importance.</p>
