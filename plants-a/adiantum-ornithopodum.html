<p>Adiantum ornithopodum, commonly known as the bird's foot fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble a bird's foot, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
