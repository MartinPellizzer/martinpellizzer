                <h1>Adenia dewevrei</h1>
<p>Adenia dewevrei, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a climbing shrub native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant has woody stems and palmately lobed leaves, which are often hairy. Its flowers emit a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>Adenia dewevrei is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia dewevrei has leaves that are large, elliptical, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are large, showy, and clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia dewevrei is primarily native to the rainforests of eastern and southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the states of Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within these regions. It is often associated with rocky or clay soils in understorey habitats.</p>
<p>Adenia dewevrei is an important component of the native flora in these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia dewevrei was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions due to its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several countries across Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Africa. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming an invasive species in non-native environments.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and mitigate ecological impacts.</p>
