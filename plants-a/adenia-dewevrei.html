                <h1>Adenia dewevrei</h1>
<p>Adenia dewevrei, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a striking climbing plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fragrant, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a woody stem with smooth, dark green leaves that are often heart-shaped. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with five petals and a prominent, showy center.</p>
<p>Adenia dewevrei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in shaded, moist environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia dewevrei has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring up to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is brownish-gray in color, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. Its flowers are large, showy, and bisexual, with five petals that are pink to purple in color, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia dewevrei is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations within the eastern rainforests of the country. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high levels of organic matter in the soil. The species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, Adenia dewevrei is considered critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenia dewevrei is a striking tropical plant known for its vibrant flowers and unique appearance, often cultivated in warm climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, especially during the warm seasons, and thrives in well-draining soil with regular watering. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant and encourage blooming are essential for its health.</p>
<p>While it is generally resistant to pests and diseases, it may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions, and planting it with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
