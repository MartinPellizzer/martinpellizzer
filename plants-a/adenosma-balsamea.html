                <h1>Adenosma balsamea</h1>
<p>Adenosma balsamea, commonly known as the balsam plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, often aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with showy bracts that attract pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Adenosma balsamea is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma balsamea has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal umbels, featuring five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma balsamea is primarily native to Southeast Asia, specifically parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. The plant is commonly associated with humid climates and well-drained soils. It is typically found in shaded undergrowth, where it can receive partial sunlight.</p>
<p>Adenosma balsamea is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma balsamea was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as accidental transport via contaminated soil or equipment.</p>
<p>It thrives in disturbed environments, including roadsides, fields, and abandoned areas, which are common in urban and agricultural landscapes. This plant has shown adaptability to various soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade, contributing to its spread. Its rapid growth and ability to produce numerous seeds enhance its competitive advantage over native species.</p>
<p>As a result, Adenosma balsamea has become a concern in some regions due to its potential to invade and alter local ecosystems.</p>
