                <h1>Adenostyles calcarea</h1>
<p>Adenostyles calcarea, commonly known as the limestone bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are alternate and lanceolate, often with hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>Adenostyles calcarea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostyles calcarea has leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, woody, and has a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles calcarea is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and parts of Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky habitats such as chaparral and coastal sage scrub. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often associated with coastal and inland mountain regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches where it can tolerate drought and poor soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles calcarea was mainly introduced to areas with limestone soils and open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, gravelly slopes, and dry meadows. This plant has a low-growing habit with narrow, fleshy leaves and produces small, greenish flowers. It is often mistaken for native species due to its similar appearance.</p>
<p>Its distribution is primarily limited to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada.</p>
