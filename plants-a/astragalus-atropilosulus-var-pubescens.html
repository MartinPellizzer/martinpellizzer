                    <h1>Astragalus atropilosulus var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Astragalus atropilosulus var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy yellow milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and produces cylindrical, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, semi-desert environments.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its pubescent (hairy) texture, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
