                    <h1>Aeranthes muscicola</h1>
<p>Aeranthes muscicola, commonly known as the moss orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, moss-like growth habit and produces small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocks or in shaded forest floors. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival.</p>
