<p>Aridaria esterhuyseniae, commonly known as the Esterhuysenia grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
