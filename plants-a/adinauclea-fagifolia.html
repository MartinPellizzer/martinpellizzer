                <h1>Adinauclea fagifolia</h1>
<p>Adinauclea fagifolia, commonly known as the sweet woodruff, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and small, white to yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed each. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Adinauclea fagifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinauclea fagifolia has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green, with five petals and stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that matures to a reddish color, dispersing its seeds through animal consumption and droppings.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded forest soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinauclea fagifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, particularly in regions with moist, tropical climates. This plant thrives in shaded undergrowth and is often associated with secondary growth forests. It is also present in some parts of India and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinauclea fagifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and potential for erosion control.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 1970s and has since spread across various regions, particularly in the North Island. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal and riparian areas. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites have led to concerns about its invasive potential.</p>
<p>Despite its ecological impact, it remains popular in horticultural settings for its aesthetic value.</p>
