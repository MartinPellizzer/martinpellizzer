                <h1>Acrostichum caudatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum caudatum, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnately divided leaves that are typically bright green with a golden hue on the underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forest understories. Its fronds are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Acrostichum caudatum plays a role in providing habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum caudatum has large, feather-like leaves that are linear and arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind once it opens.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping it to spread and anchor in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum caudatum is primarily native to the tropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, wetlands, and mangrove swamps where it thrives in saline and brackish water conditions. This plant is particularly abundant in countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and the Caribbean islands. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of moist, nutrient-rich soils near coastal environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum caudatum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in coastal areas and wetlands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often associated with disturbed or riparian habitats. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and urban environments.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it has been introduced.</p>
