                <h1>Acaena microphylla var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Acaena microphylla var. microphylla, commonly known as New Zealand brake, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features small, persistent, spiny leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, berry-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its hardy nature and ability to colonize disturbed or marginal areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acaena microphylla var. microphylla has compound leaves that are typically trifoliate, with oval to elliptical leaflets that are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually green, with a smooth surface and a moderate size, ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length. The stems are wiry and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age, and they grow upright with a bushy habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a bur-like structure that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>The seeds are dispersed by animals that brush against the burs, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena microphylla var. microphylla is a low-growing shrub native to the southern regions of South America, including Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of New Zealand, where it was introduced as an ornamental plant. This species thrives in temperate climates, often growing in coastal areas and on sandy or rocky soils. It typically occurs at altitudes ranging from sea level to approximately 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, it is considered of least concern in terms of conservation status due to its widespread distribution and adaptability.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acaena microphylla var. microphylla is a low-growing, flowering shrub native to New Zealand, known for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within two to three years, and prefers well-drained soil with moderate watering.</p>
<p>Fertilization should be minimal, with a balanced fertilizer applied in spring, while pruning is best done after flowering to maintain shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or sedum can enhance its growth and aesthetic appeal in garden settings.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
