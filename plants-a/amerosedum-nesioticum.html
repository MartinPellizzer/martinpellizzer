                    <h1>Amerosedum nesioticum</h1>
<p>Amerosedum nesioticum, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in high-salinity conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
