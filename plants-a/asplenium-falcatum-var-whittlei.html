<p>Asplenium falcatum var. whittlei, commonly known as the Whittle's maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, dark green fronds that resemble the shape of a sickle. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in compact clusters called sori.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings.</p>
