<p>Aphanosperma sinaloense, commonly known as the Sinaloan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Mexican state of Sinaloa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as members of the Lauraceae family. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has small, scale-like structures that aid in photosynthesis. Its small, white or pale green flowers are followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>Aphanosperma sinaloense plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
