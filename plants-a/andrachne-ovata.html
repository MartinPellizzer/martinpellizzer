                    <h1>Andrachne ovata</h1>
<p>Andrachne ovata, commonly known as the oval sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a dry capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Andrachne ovata plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or degraded habitats.</p>
