                    <h1>Aleuritia involucrata</h1>
<p>Aleuritia involucrata, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clusters of bright red, papery bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small white flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible but often consumed by birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Aleuritia involucrata is also valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
