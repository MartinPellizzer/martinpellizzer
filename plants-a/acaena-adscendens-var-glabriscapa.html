<p>Acaena adscendens var. glabriscapa, commonly known as the silky burr or slender spinifex, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with woody stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that are adapted for animal dispersal, and its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue. It thrives in coastal and sandy environments, tolerating salt spray and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its erosion control capabilities and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes.</p>
