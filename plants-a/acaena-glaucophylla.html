                        <h1>Acaena glaucophylla</h1>
<p>Acaena glaucophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf acaena, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spiny, spherical fruits. Its leaves and stems are covered in dense, stiff hairs, which provide protection against herbivores.</p>
<p>Acaena glaucophylla thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins and rocky areas.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena glaucophylla is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the South Island, particularly in the eastern regions. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as scrublands and grasslands. It is commonly associated with coastal and inland areas with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to specific ecological zones within New Zealand.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena glaucophylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, often in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems.</p>
