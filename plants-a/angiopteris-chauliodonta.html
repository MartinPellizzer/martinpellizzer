                    <h1>Angiopteris chauliodonta</h1>
<p>Angiopteris chauliodonta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant's rhizomes are long and creeping, allowing it to spread across the substrate. Its spores are produced in sori located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>Angiopteris chauliodonta plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
