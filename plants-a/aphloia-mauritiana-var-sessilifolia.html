<p>It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and has lance-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack a petiole. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in dry, sunny environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range.</p>
