                <h1>Aegiphila congesta</h1>
<p>Aegiphila congesta, commonly known as the clustered aegiphila, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in whorls along the stems, and bloom during the dry season.</p>
<p>Aegiphila congesta is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal areas and dry forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila congesta has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and branching, with a grayish-brown bark that is smooth when young and becomes rough with age. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring small, tubular structures with purple to pinkish hues, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by birds. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soils it inhabits.</p>
