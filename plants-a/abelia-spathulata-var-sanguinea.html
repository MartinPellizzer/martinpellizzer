                <h1>Abelia spathulata var. sanguinea</h1>
<p>Abelia spathulata var. sanguinea, commonly known as the red-leaf abelia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that turn a striking red in the autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soil.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental foliage and moderate drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abelia spathulata var. sanguinea has ovate to elliptic leaves that are glossy, dark green on top, and lighter green underneath, with a smooth margin.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged oppositely along the stems and measure approximately 2-4 inches in length. The stems are slender, reddish-brown in color, and have a smooth texture, with a spreading growth habit that forms a dense shrub. The flowers are clusters of small, tubular, pink to red blooms that appear in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies through nectar.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds via wind dispersal, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting well to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelia spathulata var. sanguinea is a rare variant of the abelia plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>Although its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including botanical gardens and private collections in North America and Europe. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments with well-drained soil, often found in forest understories. It typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited cultivation, it is considered a conservation concern and is listed as vulnerable in some regional assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abelia spathulata var. sanguinea is a compact, flowering shrub known for its vibrant red flowers and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through softwood cuttings in spring or by dividing established clumps, which ensures genetic consistency. This variety has a moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 3 to 5 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, moist soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilize with a balanced fertilizer in early spring, and prune after flowering to maintain shape and promote new growth. It is generally pest and disease resistant, though aphids and powdery mildew can occasionally occur.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its ornamental appeal and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Abelia spathulata var. sanguinea is a valuable plant that provides nectar and berries, serving as a food source for birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies, due to its showy flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved soil conditions. Its dense foliage offers shelter and nesting sites for birds and insects.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Abelia spathulata var. sanguinea is a decorative shrub primarily valued for its ornamental uses in gardens and landscaping due to its attractive pink flowers and glossy foliage.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its flowers may be occasionally used in floral arrangements or as a natural dye. In traditional medicine, some parts of the plant may have been used for their mild astringent properties, though scientific validation is limited. It also holds cultural significance in certain regions where it is grown for its aesthetic appeal and may symbolize resilience or beauty.</p>
<p>Industrially, it contributes to the horticultural economy by being a popular choice for ornamental plant cultivation.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Abelia spathulata var. sanguinea has several popular cultivars, including 'Kleim's Wonder' and 'Schmidt's Beauty', which are prized for their vibrant red flowers and compact growth.</p>
<p>It is also used in hybridization to create new varieties with improved traits such as enhanced flower color and disease resistance. Hybrid forms often combine the hardiness of Abelia spathulata with the ornamental qualities of other Abelia species. These hybrids are highly valued in horticulture for their adaptability to different climates and their ability to thrive in a variety of garden settings.</p>
<p>Overall, the cultivars and hybrids of Abelia spathulata var. sanguinea play an important role in ornamental gardening and landscape design.</p>
