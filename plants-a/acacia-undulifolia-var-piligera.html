                        <h1>Acacia undulifolia var. piligera</h1>
<p>Acacia undulifolia var. piligera, commonly known as the woolly wattle, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant has finely serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing food and shelter for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia undulifolia var. piligera is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.</p>
<p>This variant is commonly found in sandy soils and rocky outcrops, often in areas with low rainfall. It thrives in environments with high sunlight exposure and is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. The plant is known for its distinctive wavy leaf margins and is often used in traditional medicine by local communities.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the specific ecological niches it occupies in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia undulifolia var. piligera was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Western Cape and surrounding areas, particularly in fynbos vegetation. This plant is often associated with rocky outcrops and sandy soils, thriving in dry, sunny conditions. Its introduction has led to some ecological concerns due to its potential to spread aggressively.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance.</p>
