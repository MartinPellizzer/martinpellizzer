                    <h1>Androsace lehmannii</h1>
<p>Androsace lehmannii, commonly known as Lehmann's cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are adapted to cold and harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring, typically clustered at the center of the rosette. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas with high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is considered an important indicator species for alpine ecosystems.</p>
