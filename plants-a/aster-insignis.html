                    <h1>Aster insignis</h1>
<p>Aster insignis, commonly known as the mountain aster, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude environment.</p>
<p>Aster insignis plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during its brief flowering season.</p>
