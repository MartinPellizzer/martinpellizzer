                    <h1>Anthocoma</h1>
<p>Anthocoma, commonly known as the "buttercup" or "meadow buttercup," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their showy, yellow or orange flowers with five to eight petals, often surrounded by a ring of sepals. Anthocoma species typically have basal leaves that are palmately divided, and their stems are usually hairy. They are found in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges, across temperate regions.</p>
<p>Many species are short-lived annuals or biennials, and they play a role in pollination by attracting insects such as bees and butterflies.</p>
