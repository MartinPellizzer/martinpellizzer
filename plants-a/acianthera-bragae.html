                <h1>Acianthera bragae</h1>
<p>Acianthera bragae, commonly known as the Brazilian violet or the purple orchid, is a species of orchid native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of tree trunks or branches rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Acianthera bragae is prized for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera bragae has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals with a slight pink hue, blooming during the late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera bragae is primarily native to Brazil South and Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the Atlantic Forest biome. The plant thrives in rocky or forested areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats in these regions of Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera bragae was mainly introduced to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the eastern part of the island, particularly in areas with moist, shaded environments. The plant thrives in tropical rainforests and has adapted well to the local climate. It is often seen growing on tree trunks and in the understory of dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on native plant species.</p>
