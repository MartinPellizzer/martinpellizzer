<p>Aloe lanzae, commonly known as the desert aloe, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow to orange flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Aloe lanzae is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its leaves and having a deep root system.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal.</p>
