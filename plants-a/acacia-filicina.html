<p>Acacia filicina, commonly known as the slender acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, globular inflorescences, which are followed by flat, leathery pods. Acacia filicina is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and a capacity to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria.</p>
<p>It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
