<p>Aristolochia juruana, commonly known as the Brazilian pipevine, is a climbing vine native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, complex, and often fragrant flowers that resemble pipes, with a deep purple to brown coloration. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant is known for containing aristolochic acids, which are toxic to many animals.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling.</p>
