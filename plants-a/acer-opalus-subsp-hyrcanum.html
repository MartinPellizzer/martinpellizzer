                <h1>Acer opalus subsp. hyrcanum</h1>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>hyrcanum, commonly known as the Hyrcanian maple, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of Asia, particularly in parts of Iran and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive foliage, which features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically green in summer and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn, adding ornamental value to the landscape. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for cultivation in gardens and parks.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>hyrcanum has alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, often turning red or orange in autumn. The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a deciduous tree with a spreading crown.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, greenish-yellow catkins that appear in early spring, with wind as the primary pollination method. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in temperate and subtropical climates.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>hyrcanum is a rare tree species native to the Caucasus region, specifically found in parts of southern Russia and northern Iran. Its current distribution is limited, with populations primarily occurring in the mountainous areas of the Caucasus and the Iranian plateau.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates, typically in mixed forests and on rocky slopes. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation and climate change, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>hyrcanum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and elegant form. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. The tree grows slowly, reaching maturity over several decades, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, loamy soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning to maintain shape and remove dead branches are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its ornamental appeal in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>hyrcanum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The tree acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing soil stability and promoting the growth of other plant species. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality through photosynthesis.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>hyrcanum is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited culinary use due to its small and bitter fruits. While not widely used in traditional medicine, some local communities may use its leaves or bark for minor health purposes.</p>
<p>It contributes to the ecological balance by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species, thus playing a role in industrial and economic forestry practices. Culturally, it may hold symbolic value in certain regions where it is native, representing resilience or natural beauty.</p>
<p>However, its overall applications remain relatively niche compared to more commonly cultivated maple species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>hyrcanum has several popular cultivars, including 'Sutherlandii' and 'Tortuosum', which are prized for their striking foliage and ornamental value. It is also commonly used in hybridization to create new maple varieties with enhanced traits such as improved cold hardiness and unique leaf patterns.</p>
<p>Hybrids involving this subspecies often exhibit vibrant autumn colors and compact growth, making them popular in landscape design. Its horticultural importance lies in its adaptability to various climates and its role in expanding the diversity of ornamental maples.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic appeal and versatility, it remains a valuable species in modern horticulture.</p>
