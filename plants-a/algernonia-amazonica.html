                    <h1>Algernonia amazonica</h1>
<p>Algernonia amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the dense rainforests of the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped white petals that bloom during the rainy season. The plant has a compact, shrub-like structure with dark green, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers emit a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators, such as certain species of bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Algernonia amazonica is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
