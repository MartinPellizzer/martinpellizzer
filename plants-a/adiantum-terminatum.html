                <h1>Adiantum terminatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum terminatum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum terminatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum terminatum has frond-like leaves that are feather-shaped (pinnate), arranged in a rosette pattern, and typically measure about 10-20 cm in length, with a dark green color that often turns bronze in the fall.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead having a creeping rhizome that grows horizontally near the soil surface, covered in a thin, smooth, and pale brown bark. It does not produce flowers, as it is a fern and reproduces through spores rather than seeds. The fruit is not applicable, as it does not produce fruits; instead, it produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which release spores for dispersal by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum terminatum is primarily native to Belize, Bolivia, Brazil North, Brazil Northeast, Brazil South, Brazil Southeast, Brazil West-Central, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Mexico Southeast, Nicaragua, Panam√°, Peru, Suriname, Trinidad-Tobago, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in humid lowland areas. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant is known for its delicate, lace-like fronds and is often used in horticulture.</p>
<p>Its wide distribution across South and Central America reflects its adaptability to various ecological conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum terminatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. This fern is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its delicate, lace-like fronds. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species and can sometimes outcompete native vegetation in certain habitats.</p>
