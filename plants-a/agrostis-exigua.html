                    <h1>Agrostis exigua</h1>
<p>Agrostis exigua, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is often found in moist, well-drained soils such as those in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a common weed in cultivated areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it adaptable to different ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and agricultural contexts.</p>
