                <h1>Acrospelion glaciale</h1>
<p>Acrospelion glaciale, commonly known as the glacier moss, is a type of cryptogamic plant that thrives in cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amblystomataceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. This plant is adapted to harsh conditions, including low temperatures and poor soil nutrients. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in alpine and Arctic regions.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered an indicator species for environmental change.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrospelion glaciale has small, needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish bark that grows upright and is often found in alpine environments. It produces tiny, inconspicuous white flowers in early summer, with a simple structure and wind as the primary pollination method. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal, and the seeds are lightweight with a feathery appendage.</p>
<p>Its roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky, nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrospelion glaciale is primarily native to Spain.</p>
<p>It is found in specific regions within the country, particularly in the northern and central areas. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. It is adapted to the cool, moist conditions typical of these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited, reflecting its specialized ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrospelion glaciale was mainly introduced to areas with cold, alpine environments where it can thrive in rocky and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is typically found in high-altitude regions, often growing in crevices or on exposed slopes. This plant is adapted to low temperatures and limited sunlight, making it a characteristic species of mountainous ecosystems. Its introduction to new areas has been largely due to human activity, such as horticultural trade or accidental transport.</p>
<p>However, its spread is generally limited by its specific environmental requirements.</p>
