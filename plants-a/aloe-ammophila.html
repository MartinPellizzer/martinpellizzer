<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. The leaves are typically gray-green in color with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in dune ecosystems.</p>
