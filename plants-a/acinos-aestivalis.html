                    <h1>Acinos aestivalis</h1>
<p>Acinos aestivalis, commonly known as the summer cushion grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh alpine environments. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acinos aestivalis is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
