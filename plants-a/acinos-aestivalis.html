                <h1>Acinos aestivalis</h1>
<p>Acinos aestivalis, commonly known as the summer cushion grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh alpine environments. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acinos aestivalis is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos aestivalis has leaves that are narrow, linear, and grass-like, arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color, growing in a丛生 pattern. The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense, spherical heads, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical dispersal when the capsule bursts.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos aestivalis is primarily native to southern Europe, including countries such as Spain, Portugal, France, and Italy.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of North Africa, including Morocco and Algeria. This plant thrives in rocky and calcareous soils, often growing in mountainous or coastal areas. It is commonly found in open habitats such as grasslands, slopes, and along cliffs.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the Mediterranean region, where it has adapted to the dry and sunny conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos aestivalis was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in open grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in regions with moderate precipitation. This plant is commonly used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. It has been introduced to several regions beyond its native habitat, including parts of the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely determined by its adaptability to specific soil and climate conditions.</p>
