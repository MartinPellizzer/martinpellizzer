<p>Amphithalea rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often edible roots. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough, sandpaper-like texture, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Amphithalea rostrata is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
