                    <h1>Appendicula collina</h1>
<p>Appendicula collina, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a small, flowering plant native to the alpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, glandular hairs that provide protection against UV radiation and desiccation.</p>
<p>Appendicula collina is often found in rocky soils and meadows, thriving in cool, moist conditions.</p>
