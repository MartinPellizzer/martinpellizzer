<p>Aridaria constricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf aridaria, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Aridaria constricta is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
