                <h1>Achroanthes monophyllos</h1>
<p>Achroanthes monophyllos, commonly known as the single-leaf achroanthes, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its single, broad, lance-shaped leaf that is often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in late spring, making it a unique addition to botanical gardens. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in swampy areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achroanthes monophyllos has leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and slightly serrated edges.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achroanthes monophyllos is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal regions and adjacent inland areas of these states. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline and in open, sunny habitats. It is often associated with dunes, grasslands, and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achroanthes monophyllos was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activities such as agriculture and land clearing.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often an early colonizer in ecological succession. Its introduction has been documented in parts of California and other western U.S. states.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can spread rapidly and may compete with native species in invaded habitats.</p>
