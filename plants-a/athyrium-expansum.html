                    <h1>Athyrium expansum</h1>
<p>Athyrium expansum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or drooping, with a distinctive, airy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
