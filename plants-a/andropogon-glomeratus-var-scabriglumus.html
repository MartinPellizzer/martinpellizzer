<p>Andropogon glomeratus var. scabriglumus, commonly known as rough bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common component of native prairie and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, contributing to its ecological importance in native ecosystems.</p>
