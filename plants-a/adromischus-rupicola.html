                    <h1>Adromischus rupicola</h1>
<p>Adromischus rupicola, commonly known as the rock rose or stone plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish or reddish tinge, arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
