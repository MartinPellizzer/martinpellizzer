                    <h1>Angiopteris microura</h1>
<p>Angiopteris microura, commonly known as the small-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both a sporophytic and gametophytic stage, typical of ferns. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant in shallow water, while the fronds float on the surface.</p>
<p>Angiopteris microura plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
