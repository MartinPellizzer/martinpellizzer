                        <h1>Acacia glutea</h1>
<p>Acacia glutea, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves that are gray-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular heads, which are followed by flat, woody pods containing seeds. Acacia glutea is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common sight in savannas and rocky areas.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems and has been used traditionally for various purposes, including as a source of fiber and in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia glutea is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It thrives in savanna and woodland habitats, often found in areas with well-drained soils. This plant is commonly associated with dry and semi-arid environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. It is also found in parts of southern Arabia and the Horn of Africa.</p>
<p>Acacia glutea is well adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia glutea was mainly introduced to areas with dry and semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Sudan, Ethiopia, and Somalia. This plant is often used for its hardy nature, providing shade and serving as a source of timber and fuelwood. Its introduction has also been associated with afforestation efforts in degraded lands.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
