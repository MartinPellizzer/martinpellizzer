                        <h1>Acaena subflaccida</h1>
<p>Acaena subflaccida, commonly known as the soft burr bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, spherical fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fibrous, woolly covering. The plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture.</p>
<p>Acaena subflaccida plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena subflaccida is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in temperate climates, often growing in coastal areas and on rocky slopes. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to a variety of environmental conditions. It is often associated with shrublands and grasslands, where it contributes to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern parts of South America, where it plays an important ecological role.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena subflaccida was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as a contaminant in agricultural products or through the movement of livestock. This plant is now considered an invasive species in certain regions of New Zealand. It thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
