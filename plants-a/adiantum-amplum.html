                <h1>Adiantum amplum</h1>
<p>Adiantum amplum, commonly known as the broad shield fern, is a species of fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its fronds are often covered with a fine layer of silky hairs, giving them a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Adiantum amplum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum amplum has delicate, finely divided leaves that are pinnately arranged, with a feathery appearance and a bright green color.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically narrow and elongated, reaching up to 30 cm in length, and are arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright without branching. Adiantum amplum is a sterile species, meaning it does not produce flowers or fruits, so these characteristics are not applicable.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum amplum is primarily native to Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico Central, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Northwest, Mexico Southeast, Mexico Southwest, Nicaragua, Panam√°, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. It is often seen growing on tree trunks or along streams.</p>
<p>Its native distribution spans a wide range across Central America and parts of northern South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum amplum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and streamside habitats. This fern is often cultivated in gardens due to its delicate, lace-like fronds and ability to thrive in humid conditions. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in these regions and is sometimes classified as an invasive plant.</p>
