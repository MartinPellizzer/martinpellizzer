                    <h1>Antirrhinum glutinosum var. rupestre</h1>
<p>Antirrhinum glutinosum var. rupestre, commonly known as the stickyplant or sticky antirrhinum, is a perennial herb native to rocky and arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which helps reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from spring to autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptive traits make it an interesting subject for botanical study and horticultural cultivation.</p>
