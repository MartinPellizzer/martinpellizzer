<p>Athrixia pinifolia, commonly known as the needleleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a dark green to blackish upper surface with a distinctive, leaf-like structure. The thallus is leathery and often covered with tiny, hair-like structures called rhizines. It is typically found on bark, soil, or rocks in temperate forests.</p>
<p>This lichen plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
