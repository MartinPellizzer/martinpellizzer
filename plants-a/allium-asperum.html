                    <h1>Allium asperum</h1>
<p>Allium asperum, commonly known as wild leek, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a tall, flowering stem topped with a umbel of white or pale pink flowers. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor, making it a valued wild plant in some cuisines.</p>
<p>However, it is often confused with other Allium species due to its similar appearance.</p>
