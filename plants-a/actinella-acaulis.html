                <h1>Actinella acaulis</h1>
<p>Actinella acaulis, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It forms dense, compact cushions of foliage that help it retain moisture and resist harsh environmental conditions. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden among the foliage.</p>
<p>Actinella acaulis is well adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinella acaulis has small, rounded leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a bluish-green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a dark brown bark that is smooth and slightly rough to the touch. Its flowers are simple, consisting of five white petals, and bloom in early spring, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when it dries and splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping to anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella acaulis is primarily native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, including regions of Oregon and Washington.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest environments, particularly in areas with rich, organic soil. This plant thrives in cool, humid climates and is often associated with coniferous and mixed hardwood forests. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches, making it a rare and localized species.</p>
<p>Actinella acaulis is an important component of the understory vegetation in these forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella acaulis was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, particularly on rocky shores and cliffs. This plant thrives in harsh, windy environments with high salt exposure. It is often considered an invasive species due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
