<p>Andinorchis klugii, commonly known as the Klug's orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, elongated flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in rocky or forested areas at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat, and it plays a significant role in the local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
