                <h1>Acinodendron mexicanum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in arid regions of central Mexico. It has a compact growth form and produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron mexicanum has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with leaflets that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, measuring approximately 2-5 cm in length, and have a dark green, glossy upper surface with a lighter, hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, dark brown bark that exudes a resinous scent, and it exhibits a shrub-like growth pattern with multiple branches. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming during the spring season, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are taprooted with extensive lateral roots, allowing the plant to anchor firmly in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron mexicanum is primarily native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and humid lowlands. Its distribution includes countries like Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and parts of southern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is often associated with secondary growth forests and is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron mexicanum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with ample sunlight and moderate to high rainfall. This plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and degraded forests. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including landscaping and agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems remains largely unstudied.</p>
