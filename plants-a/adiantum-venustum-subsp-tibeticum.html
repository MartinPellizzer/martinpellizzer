<p>Adiantum venustum subsp.</p>
<p>tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its finely divided, glossy green fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive rusty-brown margin.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in rocky crevices or shaded forest floors at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its fronds are bi-directionally arranged, with the fertile and sterile fronds often occurring on separate branches.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
