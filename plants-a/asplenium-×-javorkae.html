                    <h1>Asplenium × javorkae</h1>
<p>Asplenium × javorkae, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, round structures called sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Asplenium × javorkae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to tolerate low light conditions.</p>
