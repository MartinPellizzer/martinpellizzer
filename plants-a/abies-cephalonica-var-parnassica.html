                    <h1>Abies cephalonica var. parnassica</h1>
<p>Abies cephalonica var. parnassica, commonly known as the Parnassian fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the high-altitude regions of the Pindus Mountains in Greece.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more rigid compared to other fir species. The cones are typically small and clustered, with reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. This variety is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, thriving in cool, moist environments with poor soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and human activity.</p>
