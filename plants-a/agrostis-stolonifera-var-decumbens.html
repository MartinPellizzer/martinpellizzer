                    <h1>Agrostis stolonifera var. decumbens</h1>
<p>Agrostis stolonifera var. decumbens, commonly known as mat grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and forms dense mats through its stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows, lawns, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its ability to form dense turf makes it a useful plant for erosion control and ground cover.</p>
