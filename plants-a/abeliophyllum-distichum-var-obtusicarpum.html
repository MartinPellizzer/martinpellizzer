                <h1>Abeliophyllum distichum var. obtusicarpum</h1>
<p>Abeliophyllum distichum var. obtusicarpum, commonly known as the Japanese boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to Japan.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage with a compact, rounded shape, making it ideal for hedges and topiaries. The plant has small, oval leaves that remain throughout the year, providing year-round visual interest. It produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abeliophyllum distichum var. obtusicarpum has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. It produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers with four petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abeliophyllum distichum var. obtusicarpum is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of central China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While its native range was once broader, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in high-altitude areas. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soils, typically found in temperate forests and rocky slopes. This variety is typically found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts to prevent its extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abeliophyllum distichum var. obtusicarpum is a compact, evergreen shrub known for its fragrant white flowers and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-hardwood cuttings taken in late summer, which root easily in a humid environment. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 5 to 7 years, making it ideal for smaller gardens.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires consistent watering during the growing season, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Regular fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote blooming. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ornamental grasses or heathers can enhance its aesthetic appeal and improve soil health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Abeliophyllum distichum var. obtusicarpum is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and offering habitat in forested areas.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Abeliophyllum distichum var. obtusicarpum is a lesser-known plant with limited documented uses, but it is primarily valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique flowering patterns.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, some traditional practices may incorporate its parts in local remedies. Its role in industrial or economic contexts is minimal, as it does not yield significant commercial products. Culturally, it may hold symbolic value in certain regions where it is cultivated or found in the wild.</p>
<p>Overall, its primary application remains in landscaping and botanical study.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Abeliophyllum distichum var. obtusicarpum has several popular cultivars, including 'Compactum' and 'Roseum,' which are prized for their compact growth and striking floral display.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other Abeliophyllum species to produce varieties with enhanced ornamental traits. These hybrids often exhibit improved cold hardiness and extended blooming periods, making them more adaptable to diverse garden conditions. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in partial shade and its ability to provide long-lasting spring blooms.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage and flowers make it a valuable addition to woodland gardens and shade landscapes.</p>
