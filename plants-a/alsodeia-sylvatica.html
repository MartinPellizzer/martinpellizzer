<p>Alsodeia sylvatica, commonly known as the woodland alsike, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats, often along stream banks or in forest understories. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>Alsodeia sylvatica is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability in its native habitats.</p>
