<p>Angraecum ringens, commonly known as the Christmas star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, star-shaped inflorescence composed of numerous small, white to pale pink flowers.

Angraecum ringens typically blooms during the dry season, usually between July and December.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike.</p>
