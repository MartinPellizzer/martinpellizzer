<p>Acropogon megaphyllus, commonly known as the giant fern, is a large, tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in rainforests and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>The botanical significance of Acropogon megaphyllus lies in its role as an indicator species for undisturbed tropical ecosystems.</p>
