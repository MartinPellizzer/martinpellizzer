                    <h1>Arabis lasiocarpa</h1>
<p>Arabis lasiocarpa, commonly known as the woolly rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>
