<p>Acer glabrum f. rhodocarpum, commonly known as the red maple or red-leaf maple, is a variant of the red maple tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red foliage, which becomes more vibrant in the fall. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The tree produces samaras, or winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation.</p>
