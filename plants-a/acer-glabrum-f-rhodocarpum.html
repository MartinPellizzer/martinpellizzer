                <h1>Acer glabrum f. rhodocarpum</h1>
<p>Acer glabrum f. rhodocarpum, commonly known as the red-leaf maple, is a variant of the maple tree characterized by its striking red foliage.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that belongs to the Sapindaceae family, native to parts of East Asia. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy, dark green upper surface. During the autumn, the leaves turn vibrant shades of red and orange, making it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in landscaping and garden design.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum f. rhodocarpum has palmate leaves that are typically 5-7 lobed, with a bright green color during the growing season and a vibrant red or orange hue in autumn; the leaves are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light gray bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in catkins, blooming in early spring; they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum f. rhodocarpum is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Tibet and western Sichuan in China.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these high-altitude areas. It thrives in cool, moist temperate forests with well-drained soils, typically found in mixed hardwood stands. This species grows at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat fragmentation, it is considered endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum f. rhodocarpum is a rare and ornamental variant of the maple tree known for its striking red foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. The growth cycle of this plant includes a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires consistent watering during the growing season, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigolds can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum f. rhodocarpum is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in mixed landscapes, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a range of ecological interactions. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil structure and fertility.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum f. rhodocarpum is a variant of the maple tree known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its wood is sometimes utilized in small-scale woodworking due to its fine grain and durability. In traditional medicine, parts of the plant may be used for their potential anti-inflammatory properties, though scientific validation is limited. Culturally, it is often appreciated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and parks, symbolizing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting local biodiversity also makes it important for environmental conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum f. rhodocarpum has several popular cultivars that are highly valued in horticulture, such as 'Crimson King' and 'Variegatum', which are known for their striking foliage colors.</p>
<p>This form is often used as a parent in hybridization efforts to develop new ornamental maple varieties. Hybrids involving Acer glabrum f. rhodocarpum are frequently bred for improved cold hardiness and enhanced leaf coloration. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to contribute unique traits to modern maple cultivars.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it remains a significant species in landscape design and botanical collections.</p>
