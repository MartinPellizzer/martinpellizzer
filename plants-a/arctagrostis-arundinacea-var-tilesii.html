<p>Arctagrostis arundinacea var. tilesii, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern coast of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and tufted inflorescences that produce small, pale green to brown spikelets. This variety is adapted to sandy, coastal soils and can tolerate salt spray and wind, making it a hardy plant in maritime environments. It often forms dense mats, contributing to erosion control and stabilizing dunes.</p>
<p>The plant is widely used in coastal restoration projects due to its resilience and ecological benefits.</p>
