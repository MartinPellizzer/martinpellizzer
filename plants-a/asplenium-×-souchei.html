                    <h1>Asplenium × souchei</h1>
<p>Asplenium × souchei, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium × souchei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in controlled indoor conditions.</p>
