<p>Aridaria lignea, commonly known as the desert wood plant, is a shrub adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>It has thick, woody stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are small and often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale flowers that attract pollinators like bees and moths.</p>
<p>It is native to regions with hot, dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
