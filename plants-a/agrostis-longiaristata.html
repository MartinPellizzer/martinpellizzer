<p>Agrostis longiaristata, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. The plant has slender,丛生 (clumping) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
