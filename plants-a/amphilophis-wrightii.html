<p>Amphilophis wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweeds and related species. The plant is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. It produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in supporting local ecosystems, though it is less commonly cultivated than other milkweed species.</p>
