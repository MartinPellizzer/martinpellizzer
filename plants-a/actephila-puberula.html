                <h1>Actephila puberula</h1>
<p>Actephila puberula, commonly known as the hairy actephila, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stem. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental appeal. Actephila puberula is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a notable species for ecological studies and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila puberula has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, fuzzy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, shady habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila puberula is primarily native to the Andaman Islands and Nicobar Islands.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical regions of these island chains. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within the forests. The plant is well adapted to the humid climate and rich biodiversity of the area.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific geographic locations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila puberula was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been documented in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. Its introduction is believed to be due to accidental dispersal through human activity or natural spread from nearby habitats.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains under study due to limited data on its distribution and effects on native flora.</p>
