                <h1>Adamanthus arbuscula</h1>
<p>Adamanthus arbuscula, commonly known as the Florida holly or dwarf holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with spines along the leaf edges. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded areas.</p>
<p>Adamanthus arbuscula is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adamanthus arbuscula has simple, alternate, lanceolate leaves that are typically 5–10 cm long and 1–2 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and exhibits a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamanthus arbuscula is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. This species thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often associated with hammocks and pine flatwoods. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its distinctive, cone-like fruit that resembles a small tree.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamanthus arbuscula was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Texas and Louisiana, as a ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed soils and open areas, thriving in full sun conditions. The plant is known for its small, clustered flowers and its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions. Although it is not native to these regions, it has become established in the local ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and does not spread aggressively in most environments.</p>
