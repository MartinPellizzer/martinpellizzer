                    <h1>Atriplex gracilis</h1>
<p>Atriplex gracilis, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to saline and drought conditions. The plant produces small greenish flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources in poor soils.</p>
<p>Atriplex gracilis is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate harsh environmental conditions.</p>
