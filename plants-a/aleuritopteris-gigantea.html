                    <h1>Aleuritopteris gigantea</h1>
<p>Aleuritopteris gigantea, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It has long, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, making it a striking feature in wetland environments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater, often found in marshes and ponds. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically green, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention and resistance to herbivory.</p>
