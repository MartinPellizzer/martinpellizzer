                        <h1>Acalypha stenoloba</h1>
<p>Acalypha stenoloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf erythranthe, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha stenoloba belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of a complex life cycle involving alternation of generations. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises a group of vascular plants that includes horsetails and some ferns, known for their primitive features. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a large group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is characterized by a wide range of floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a diverse order of flowering plants that includes many species with specialized adaptations for various environments. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse morphologies and some containing toxic compounds. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cupweed," characterized by their distinctive leaf shapes and often showy inflorescences.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha stenoloba, a specific plant within the genus Acalypha, distinguished by its narrow leaves and specific growth habits, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha stenoloba is primarily native to Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the Andean regions of these countries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded areas. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely confined to the western part of South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha stenoloba was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The introduction occurred in the late 19th century, primarily through horticultural trade. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and urban areas.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems.</p>
