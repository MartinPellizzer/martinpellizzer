                <h1>Acrostichum fistulosum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum fistulosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with a prominent central disk. It thrives in wet, sunny environments and is often found near water bodies.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum fistulosum has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows vertically. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers with three petals, usually in shades of yellow or green, which bloom in early summer and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum fistulosum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Indo-Pacific, including parts of Southeast Asia, the Philippines, and northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, riverbanks, and wetlands where it thrives in moist, saline environments. This plant is well adapted to brackish water conditions and often grows in mangrove swamps or salt marshes. Its distribution extends to the western Pacific, including Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum fistulosum was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant thrives in saline and brackish environments, making it well-suited for coastal areas. It has been reported in states such as Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>
