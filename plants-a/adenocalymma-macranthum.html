<p>Adenocalymma macranthum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy, pink or red flowers. The plant is typically found in sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich color, though it is now protected due to overharvesting.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma macranthum plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma macranthum has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with oval-shaped leaflets that are typically green and slightly hairy.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical and woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that peels off in thin layers. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, featuring yellow petals and stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out underground, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma macranthum is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern and northern regions of the country. This plant grows in coastal areas and on sandy soils. It is commonly seen in the provinces of KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma macranthum is well adapted to the warm, humid climate of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma macranthum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with abundant sunlight and moderate rainfall, making it suitable for cultivation in regions such as parts of Southeast Asia, the Caribbean, and northern Australia. This plant is often grown as an ornamental due to its attractive, showy flowers and adaptability to various soil types. Its introduction has been primarily for horticultural purposes, though it has occasionally naturalized in some regions.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited compared to more invasive exotic species.</p>
