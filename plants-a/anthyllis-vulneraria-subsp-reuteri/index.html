                            <h1>Anthyllis Vulneraria Subsp. Reuteri</h1>
<p>Common broom, scientifically known as Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. reuteri, is a small flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate yellow blooms and upright growth habit, often found in open, sunny habitats. This subspecies is part of the legume family, which allows it to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance. Its resilience and adaptability make it a notable species in both natural and managed landscapes.</p>
