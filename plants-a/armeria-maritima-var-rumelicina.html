                    <h1>Armeria maritima var. rumelicina</h1>
<p>Armeria maritima var. rumelicina, commonly known as sea thrift, is a coastal plant native to the British Isles and parts of northern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing evergreen perennial that forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and harsh maritime conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in coastal gardens and as a ground cover in difficult soil conditions.</p>
