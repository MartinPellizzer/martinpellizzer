                    <h1>Acacia microcybe</h1>
<p>Acacia microcybe, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, dark green leaves that are narrow and oval in shape. The plant produces yellow flowers in winter, which are clustered in globular heads, attracting various pollinators. Its seeds are encased in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Acacia microcybe is adapted to dry environments and is often found in sandy soils across arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
