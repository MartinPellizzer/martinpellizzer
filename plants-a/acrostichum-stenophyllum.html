                <h1>Acrostichum stenophyllum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that grow in a compact, upright habit. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>The narrow-leaf fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum stenophyllum has large, elongated leaves that are typically sword-shaped, arranged in a linear pattern along the stem, and can reach up to 2 meters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pale underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and cylindrical, with a smooth, dark brown bark that has a slightly fibrous texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spadices, usually yellow-green in color, blooming during the late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses its seeds by wind, and the roots are rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum stenophyllum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and high rainfall. This plant is commonly found in swampy or mangrove-like environments along coastal regions. It is well adapted to saline and waterlogged soils, making it a common species in coastal wetlands.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely tied to the tropical and subtropical climates of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum stenophyllum was mainly introduced to areas with high humidity and warm climates, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, waste areas, and along waterways. This plant is often associated with wetland environments and can thrive in poorly drained soils. Its introduction has been documented in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some areas, posing challenges to native ecosystems.</p>
