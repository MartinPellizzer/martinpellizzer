<p>Acrostichum stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that grow in a compact, upright habit. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>The narrow-leaf fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
