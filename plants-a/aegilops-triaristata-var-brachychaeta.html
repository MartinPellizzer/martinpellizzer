                    <h1>Aegilops triaristata var. brachychaeta</h1>
<p>Aegilops triaristata var. brachychaeta, commonly known as the short-hairy wild rye, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive three-branched awns on its lemmas. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as coastal areas and disturbed ground. Its small, spike-like inflorescence consists of multiple spikelets, and it produces achenes as its seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic relationship with wheat and its potential for agricultural use.</p>
