<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple spurred flowers. The plant features palmate leaves with a deeply lobed structure, and its stems are usually upright and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum puchonroenicum has compound leaves that are palmately arranged, with deeply lobed blades that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, measuring up to 30 cm in length.</p>
