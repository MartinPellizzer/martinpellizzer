<p>Araucaria neocookii, commonly known as the Cook's Araucaria, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of horizontal branches that form a distinctive umbrella-like shape.

Its foliage consists of scale-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches.</p>
<p>Araucaria neocookii is adapted to cool, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils.</p>
