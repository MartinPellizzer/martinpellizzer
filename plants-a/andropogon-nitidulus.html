                    <h1>Andropogon nitidulus</h1>
<p>Andropogon nitidulus, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and it typically grows in open woodlands and prairie habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Silver bluestem is also used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and drought tolerance.</p>
