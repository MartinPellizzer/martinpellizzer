<p>Aristida adscensionis var. nigrescens, commonly known as blackstem threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems that turn dark purple to black as they mature, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous bristly spikelets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ability to colonize degraded areas make it an important pioneer species in certain ecosystems.</p>
