                <h1>Acalypha persimilis var. scabra</h1>
<p>Acalypha persimilis var. scabra, commonly known as roughleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive rough, hairy texture on its leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often surrounded by bracts. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a unique and ornamental species in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha persimilis var. scabra has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a deep green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a slightly hairy texture. The stem is erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers with stamens that are longer than the petals, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-lobed schizocarp that splits into three winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha persimilis var. scabra is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other tropical regions, including parts of the Caribbean and the Pacific Islands. This species thrives in humid, lowland environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks. It typically grows at altitudes between 0 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its natural habitat faces threats from deforestation and habitat degradation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha persimilis var. scabra is a unique, ornamental plant known for its delicate foliage and vibrant coloration.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seed, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. This fast-growing plant thrives in a warm, humid climate with a growth cycle that spans from early spring to late fall.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant and promote bushiness are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic appeal.</p>
