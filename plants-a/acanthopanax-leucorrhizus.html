<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax leucorrhizus is a woody climbing plant native to East Asia, primarily found in China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to specific regions within these countries, particularly in mountainous areas. It thrives in temperate forests and shrublands, often growing in shaded, moist environments. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax leucorrhizus is a hardy shrub commonly cultivated for its medicinal properties and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or root division, with cuttings offering the fastest and most reliable results. This plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture levels.</p>
<p>Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant and encourage new growth are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, requiring careful monitoring.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or garlic can help deter pests and promote a healthier garden environment.</p>
