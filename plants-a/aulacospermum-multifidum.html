                    <h1>Aulacospermum multifidum</h1>
<p>Aulacospermum multifidum, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that split into multiple lobes, giving it a star-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by dry, capsule-like fruits. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water requirements.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it an interesting subject for botanical study in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
