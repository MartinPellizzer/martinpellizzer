                    <h1>Agrostis × mercieri</h1>
<p>Agrostis × mercieri, commonly known as the hybrid meadowgrass, is a sterile grass species resulting from the cross between Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis stolonifera.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically forms dense, low-growing clumps and is often found in moist, disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>While it does not produce viable seeds, it is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping due to its fine texture and adaptability.</p>
