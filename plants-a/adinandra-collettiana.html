                <h1>Adinandra collettiana</h1>
<p>Adinandra collettiana, commonly known as the Collett's adinandra, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, often found in moist, shaded habitats. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Adinandra collettiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra collettiana has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows in a climbing or shrub-like manner. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor the plant in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra collettiana is primarily native to Assam and Myanmar.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within forest understories. It is well adapted to the humid climate and nutrient-rich soils of its native habitat.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in the ecosystems of Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra collettiana was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as montane forests and secondary growth areas. The plant is often found in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activities like horticulture and land clearing.</p>
<p>It is now considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native flora.</p>
