                    <h1>Agave nevidis</h1>
<p>Agave nevidis, commonly known as the ghost agave, is a striking succulent native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spire-like stems that can reach up to 10 feet in height, covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces a large, bell-shaped inflorescence that blooms once in its lifetime, typically in shades of yellow or green. Its leaves are thick, fleshy, and often have a bluish-gray hue, providing a unique visual contrast.</p>
<p>Agave nevidis is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping.</p>
