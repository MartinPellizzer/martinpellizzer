                <h1>Achimenes picta</h1>
<p>Achimenes picta, commonly known as the painted bellflower, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, pink, and purple. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Achimenes picta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its showy blooms and compact growth habit.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes picta has heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy surface and a size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. Its flowers are showy, tubular, and borne in clusters, typically in shades of red, pink, or white, blooming from late spring to early autumn and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, allowing the plant to store nutrients and survive periods of drought.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes picta is primarily native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the understory of forests. This plant is commonly found in the Amazon Basin and other tropical rainforest areas. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and is often associated with rocky or stream-side habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in various parts of the world outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes picta was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its vibrant flowers and foliage.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and greenhouses where it thrives in warm, humid conditions. The plant is often cultivated as a bedding plant or in containers because of its ability to bloom throughout the growing season. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in some areas, where it can compete with native species.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread in non-cultivated environments.</p>
