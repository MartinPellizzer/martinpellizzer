<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, cone-like fruits. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in cloud forests or montane habitats. Its leaves are leathery and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment.</p>
