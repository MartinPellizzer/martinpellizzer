                    <h1>Acacia tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, feathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grey hairs. The plant produces yellow, globular flowerheads that appear in late winter or early spring. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Acacia tenuifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
