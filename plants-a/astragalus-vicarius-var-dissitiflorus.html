                    <h1>Astragalus vicarius var. dissitiflorus</h1>
<p>Astragalus vicarius var. dissitiflorus, commonly known as the scattered-flower milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features erect, branched stems and pinnately compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system helps it thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas.</p>
