                    <h1>Acacia globulifera</h1>
<p>Acacia globulifera, commonly known as the globular acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive globular or spherical seed pods, which are a key feature of its botanical classification. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments, and it has a deep root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia globulifera is often found in coastal areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
