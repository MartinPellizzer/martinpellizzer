                    <h1>Amphinomia riouxii</h1>
<p>Amphinomia riouxii, commonly known as the African rock orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rock-dwelling growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, intricate flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with purple markings, adapted for specific pollinators. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in sandy soils, where it forms dense clumps.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amphinomia riouxii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
