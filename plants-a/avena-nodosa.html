                    <h1>Avena nodosa</h1>
<p>Avena nodosa, commonly known as nodding oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that nod toward the ground, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, two-lobed flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Avena nodosa is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity.</p>
