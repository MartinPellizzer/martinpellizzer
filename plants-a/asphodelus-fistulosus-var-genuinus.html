<p>Asphodelus fistulosus var. genuinus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved asphodel, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, upright flower stalks that bear clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in sunny, well-drained habitats.
