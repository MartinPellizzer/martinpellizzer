                <h1>Acronia scabrilinguis</h1>
<p>Acronia scabrilinguis, commonly known as the rough-leaved acronia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Acronia scabrilinguis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia scabrilinguis has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, with a rough, scaly bark that is dark brown in color, and it grows in a creeping pattern along the ground. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring; they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia scabrilinguis is primarily native to the southern United States, specifically Texas and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and sandy soils within arid and semi-arid regions. This plant thrives in environments with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure. It is often associated with limestone outcrops and dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to a few isolated areas within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia scabrilinguis was mainly introduced to the eastern United States as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond its original cultivation areas, establishing itself in various habitats including disturbed soils and forest edges. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in diverse conditions have contributed to its widespread distribution. It is now considered invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to control its spread and mitigate its ecological impact.</p>
