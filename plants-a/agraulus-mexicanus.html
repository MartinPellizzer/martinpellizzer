                    <h1>Agraulus mexicanus</h1>
<p>Agraulus mexicanus, commonly known as the Mexican leafminer, is a small fly belonging to the family Agromyzidae.</p>
<p>It is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it primarily infests various species of plants, including some common ornamental and agricultural crops. The larvae of this species feed on the leaves, creating distinctive serpentine galleries that can damage the foliage. The plant's botanical significance lies in its role as a host for this insect, which can impact plant health and growth.</p>
<p>Its life cycle and feeding habits are closely tied to the seasonal availability of its host plants.</p>
