                <h1>Aegiphila cowanii</h1>
<p>Aegiphila cowanii, commonly known as the Cowan's aegiphila, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila cowanii has compound leaves that are opposite in arrangement, with lanceolate or ovate leaflets, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, and a dull green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grayish-brown in color. The flowers are small and clustered in umbels, with white or pale pink petals, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
