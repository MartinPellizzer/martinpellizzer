                <h1>Albizia falcataria</h1>
<p>Albizia falcataria, commonly known as the silk tree or rain tree, is a fast-growing leguminous tree native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has pinnately compound leaves that turn bright red in the autumn, adding ornamental value to its appearance. The tree produces yellow or cream-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, woody pods that split open to release the seeds.</p>
<p>Albizia falcataria is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in reforestation and soil enrichment efforts.</p>
