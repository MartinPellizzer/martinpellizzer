                    <h1>Athroisma haareri</h1>
<p>Athroisma haareri, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is extensive and adapted to anchor it in loose, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Athroisma haareri is well-suited to xerophytic conditions and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats.</p>
