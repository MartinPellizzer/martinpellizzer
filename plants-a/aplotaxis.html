                    <h1>Aplotaxis</h1>
<p>Aplotaxis, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, clustered leaves. Aplotaxis species produce yellow or white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically used for construction and tool-making.</p>
