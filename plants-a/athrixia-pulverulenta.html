                    <h1>Athrixia pulverulenta</h1>
<p>Athrixia pulverulenta, commonly known as the dust lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale to dark grayish-green thallus, which is covered in a fine, powdery layer of dust-like particles. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with a green alga and a fungus, which together provide nutrients through photosynthesis and water absorption. It is often found on rock surfaces and soil in regions with low rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a common indicator species in dryland ecosystems.</p>
