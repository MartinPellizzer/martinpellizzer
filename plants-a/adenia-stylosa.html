                <h1>Adenia stylosa</h1>
<p>Adenia stylosa, commonly known as the yellow bell vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a climbing shrub that produces striking yellow flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and is characterized by its long, twisting stems. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>The flowers are primarily pollinated by birds and insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia stylosa has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are glossy green, with a smooth texture and a waxy cuticle.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is dark brown to grey in color, and it grows as an upright shrub. The flowers are large, showy, and have a complex structure with five petals, typically pink to red in color, blooming during the wet season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia stylosa is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern and northern parts of the island, where the climate is tropical and humid. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within rainforests or along riverbanks. It is well adapted to the unique ecological conditions of Madagascar's diverse habitats.</p>
<p>Adenia stylosa plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is part of the country's rich biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia stylosa was mainly introduced to New South Wales, Australia, as part of botanical collections and horticultural interest.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal regions of the state, particularly in the northern and western parts. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in coastal heathlands and dunes. It is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique plant.</p>
