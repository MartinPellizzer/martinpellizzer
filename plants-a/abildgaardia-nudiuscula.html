                        <h1>Abildgaardia nudiuscula</h1>
<p>Abildgaardia nudiuscula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine and coastal environments. The plant has tiny, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered at the base, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers. It is well adapted to harsh climates, with a compact growth form that helps it withstand strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
<p>Abildgaardia nudiuscula is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar adaptations to cold environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abildgaardia nudiuscula is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky coastal areas and sandy shores, where it thrives in well-drained soils. This plant is particularly associated with the western Mediterranean, such as southern France, Spain, and northern Africa. It is often seen growing in dune environments and along the edges of salt marshes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats that provide the right balance of sunlight, salt exposure, and drainage.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abildgaardia nudiuscula was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there intentionally as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, small, yellow flowers. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native species for resources. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often spreading through its rhizomes.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
