                    <h1>Aristolochia anguicida</h1>
<p>Aristolochia anguicida, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and striking, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Its unique floral structure and chemical composition have made it a subject of interest in botanical and pharmacological research.</p>
<p>The species is also valued in traditional medicine, though its use is often limited due to its toxicity.</p>
