<p>Atriplex zahlensis, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, salt-tolerant hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are succulent and adapted to conserve water, making it well-suited for harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>Atriplex zahlensis is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in poor, saline soils.</p>
