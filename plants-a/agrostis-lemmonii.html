<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Agrostis lemmonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland areas.</p>
