<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its delicate, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant grows in grasslands and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Acranthera uniflora is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera uniflora has simple, narrow leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a linear shape, a bluish-green color, and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a pale green bark that is smooth and slightly roughened with age. Its flowers are small, tubular, and arranged in clusters, with a pale pink to white color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects.
