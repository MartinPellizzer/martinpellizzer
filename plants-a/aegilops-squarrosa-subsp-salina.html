<p>Aegilops squarrosa subsp.</p>
<p>salina, commonly known as the saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, glabrous leaves that are adapted to withstand high salinity.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in stabilizing coastal and saline soils and is used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
