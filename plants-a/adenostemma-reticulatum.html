                <h1>Adenostemma reticulatum</h1>
<p>Adenostemma reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined adenostemma, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant that typically grows to a height of 30 to 100 centimeters. The plant features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with prominent net-like venation, which is a characteristic feature of the genus. Its flowers are usually small and clustered in loose inflorescences, with tubular corollas that are often pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>Adenostemma reticulatum is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma reticulatum has leaves that are opposite in arrangement, ovate in shape, with a rough texture and a dark green color on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows upright with branching. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with tubular corollas that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming from summer to autumn and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant to anchor in sandy or disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma reticulatum is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands, open woodlands, and disturbed areas within these countries. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in well-drained soils. It is also occasionally reported in parts of Central America.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with areas that have a mix of dry and wet seasons, supporting its growth habits.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma reticulatum was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southwestern region.</p>
<p>It was brought there intentionally for its ornamental value and potential as a forage crop. The plant has since become naturalized in various habitats, including disturbed soils and open areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its spread beyond initial introduction sites.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions due to its competitive nature.</p>
