                <h1>Acourtia nudicaulis</h1>
<p>Acourtia nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked stalked acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a low, spreading growth habit. Its flowers are usually yellow or reddish, and it produces small, dry fruits called cypsela.</p>
<p>Acourtia nudicaulis is often found in open areas such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia nudicaulis has small, hairy, opposite leaves that are ovate in shape, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a pale green color and a somewhat woody texture, growing in a spreading pattern. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in loose inflorescences, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry, rocky habitats where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia nudicaulis is primarily native to El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico Southeast.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Acourtia nudicaulis is well adapted to the warm and humid climate of its native range.</p>
<p>It is often seen in lowland areas with well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia nudicaulis was mainly introduced to disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and waste places due to its adaptability to harsh environments.</p>
<p>It spreads primarily through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind, water, and human activity. This plant is considered invasive in some regions because it can outcompete native vegetation for resources. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions contribute to its successful establishment.</p>
<p>However, it is not always considered a major threat in all ecosystems where it is found.</p>
