                <h1>Acosta pinae</h1>
<p>Acosta pinae, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which is a distinguishing botanical feature. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with five petals, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Acosta pinae plays a role in local ecosystems, providing food and habitat for various insects and animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta pinae has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and slightly woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom during the spring and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to absorb nutrients from the surface layer of the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta pinae is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico, particularly in the states of Guanajuato, Jalisco, and Michoac√°n.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level. This plant is commonly found in dry forests and rocky slopes, where it adapts to the cooler and drier conditions. It is often associated with limestone substrates and is part of the local flora in these specific ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta pinae was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates where it can thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and partial to full sunlight. The plant has been introduced to several countries in Central and South America, as well as parts of the Caribbean. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
