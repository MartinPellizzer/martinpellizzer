<p>Abies likiangensis, commonly known as the Yunnan fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain seeds covered in a thin, winged aril. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, often found in forested areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
