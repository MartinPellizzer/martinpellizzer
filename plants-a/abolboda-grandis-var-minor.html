<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in shaded undergrowth. This variant of Abolboda grandis is adapted to humid tropical climates and is typically associated with secondary forests. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its distribution has become more restricted in some regions.</p>
