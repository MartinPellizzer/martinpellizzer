                <h1>Adamanthus alfaroi</h1>
<p>Adamanthus alfaroi, commonly known as the Brazilian ironwood, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen tree characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is highly threatened in the wild.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique botanical species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adamanthus alfaroi has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth texture, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, vertical strips as the plant matures. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to its native habitat by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamanthus alfaroi is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest biome of eastern Brazil.</p>
<p>This species is found in the states of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. It grows in humid, subtropical climates with well-drained soils. Adamanthus alfaroi is commonly found in riparian forests and shaded understories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamanthus alfaroi was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and abandoned fields. The plant has a short lifecycle and produces numerous small, white flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it a potential invasive species in non-native environments.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been observed in several regions outside its native range, raising concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
