                    <h1>Adamanthus alfaroi</h1>
<p>Adamanthus alfaroi, commonly known as the Brazilian ironwood, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen tree characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is highly threatened in the wild.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique botanical species.</p>
