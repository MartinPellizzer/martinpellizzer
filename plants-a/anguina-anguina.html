                    <h1>Anguina anguina</h1>
<p>Anguina anguina, commonly known as the common bryophyte, is a type of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a simple structure with no true roots, stems, or leaves, and instead consists of a thallus that absorbs water and nutrients directly from the environment. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, produce spores that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Anguina anguina plays a vital role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
