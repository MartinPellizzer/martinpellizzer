                <h1>Actinodaphne junghuhnii</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne junghuhnii, commonly known as the Malabar camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and smooth, greyish bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is valued for its essential oils, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of camphor.</p>
<p>The species is also appreciated in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne junghuhnii has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a deep green color.</p>
<p>Its stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a pale brown to grayish bark that exudes a slight aromatic scent, and it grows in a shrub-like form. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, ovoid drupe with a yellowish skin, containing a single seed, and it is dispersed by animals that consume the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne junghuhnii is primarily native to Sumatera.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this Indonesian island. The plant thrives in humid and shaded environments. It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within Sumatera due to its particular ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne junghuhnii was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines due to its ornamental value and potential economic use. The plant is often found in lowland evergreen forests and secondary growth areas, where it contributes to biodiversity. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its ability to spread rapidly in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, it remains an important species in horticulture and ecological restoration projects.</p>
