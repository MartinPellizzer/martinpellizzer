                <h1>Acorus cochinchinensis</h1>
<p>Acorus cochinchinensis, commonly known as the broad-leaf sweetflag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features long, sword-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spadix, typical of the Aroid family. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Acorus cochinchinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus cochinchinensis has long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant, with a dark green color and a smooth, waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is short and stout, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright from the base. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spadix surrounded by a single leaf-like bract, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed, triangular capsule that disperses seeds by wind and water.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming a dense network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus cochinchinensis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and abundant moisture. It is often associated with muddy or sandy soils in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Acorus cochinchinensis is also found in parts of southern China and the Philippines.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus cochinchinensis was mainly introduced to temperate and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, ponds, and along waterways where it thrives in moist to aquatic environments. The plant is often used in landscaping to add aesthetic appeal to water features and garden designs. However, in some areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological balance in non-native habitats.</p>
