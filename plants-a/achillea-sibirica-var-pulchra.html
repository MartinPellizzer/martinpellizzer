                <h1>Achillea sibirica var. pulchra</h1>
<p>Achillea sibirica var. pulchra, commonly known as the Siberian yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, silver-green foliage that is aromatic and slightly fuzzy to the touch. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for both ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea sibirica var. pulchra has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they are usually 5â€“10 cm long.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark, growing in a clumping pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sibirica var. pulchra is a perennial flowering plant native to central and eastern Asia, particularly found in regions of Russia, Mongolia, and parts of China.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas where it has been introduced as an ornamental plant, though it remains most common in its native range. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and steppes, often growing in well-drained soils. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>It is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status due to its adaptability and widespread presence in both natural and cultivated environments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea sibirica var. pulchra is a hardy perennial known for its showy yellow flowers and rugged beauty.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the root clumps in early spring or fall. This plant has a slow growth cycle, typically blooming in late spring to early summer and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its vigor. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or sedum can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea sibirica var. pulchra is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering food and shelter. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its beneficial properties. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and supporting biodiversity in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea sibirica var. pulchra is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value and use in garden landscaping due to its attractive, daisy-like flowers.</p>
