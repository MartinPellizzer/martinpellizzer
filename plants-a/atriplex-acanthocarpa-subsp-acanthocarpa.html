<p>Atriplex acanthocarpa subsp.</p>
<p>acanthocarpa, commonly known as the spiny saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves and spiny, triangular stems that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by edible, salt-tolerant seeds. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Its adaptations make it an important component of xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
