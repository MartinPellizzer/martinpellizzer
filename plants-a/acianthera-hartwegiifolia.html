                <h1>Acianthera hartwegiifolia</h1>
<p>Acianthera hartwegiifolia, commonly known as the Hartweg's violet, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, often epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, loose soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera hartwegiifolia has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a deep green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and covered in a smooth, pale green bark, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera hartwegiifolia is primarily native to Mexico Central and Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This orchid species is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in forests or along stream banks. The plant is known for its small, fragrant flowers and is adapted to the specific climate and soil conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in parts of central and southern Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera hartwegiifolia was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest environments. This plant has been reported in several states including Oregon and Washington. Its introduction is believed to be through horticultural trade and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>It is considered a non-native species that has established itself in local ecosystems.</p>
