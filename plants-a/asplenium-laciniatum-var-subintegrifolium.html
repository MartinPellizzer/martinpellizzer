                    <h1>Asplenium laciniatum var. subintegrifolium</h1>
<p>Asplenium laciniatum var. subintegrifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spleenwort, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are finely divided, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its more compact leaf structure compared to the typical form of A. laciniatum.</p>
