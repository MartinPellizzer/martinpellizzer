<p>Aristida stipitata subsp.</p>
<p>graciliflora, commonly known as slender-flowered threeawn, is a grass species native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spikelet-based inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
