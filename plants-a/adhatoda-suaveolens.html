                <h1>Adhatoda suaveolens</h1>
<p>Adhatoda suaveolens, commonly known as the Indian dove tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fragrant, showy white and pink flowers that resemble doves in flight, hence its common name. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in humid climates and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions.</p>
<p>The species is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda suaveolens has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth upper surface and slightly hairy lower surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 4 to 10 cm in length, with a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, somewhat woody, with a rough, dark brown bark that has a slightly fissured texture, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are borne in clusters, with tubular corollas that are typically purple or violet in color, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated primarily by birds, especially sunbirds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and relatively shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda suaveolens is primarily native to southern and eastern Asia, including regions such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in regions with warm, humid climates. This plant thrives in moist environments, often growing along riverbanks, wetlands, and in the undergrowth of tropical forests. It is also present in parts of Africa, including Kenya and Tanzania, where it adapts to similar ecological conditions.</p>
<p>Its native range includes a variety of habitats, but it is most commonly associated with the Indian subcontinent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda suaveolens was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and traditional medicinal uses.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries like India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Africa. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated in gardens and herbal farms. Its introduction has sometimes led to its naturalization in certain areas, raising concerns about its potential invasive behavior.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, careful management is recommended to prevent unintended ecological impacts.</p>
