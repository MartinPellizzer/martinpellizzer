                <h1>Adhatoda suaveolens</h1>
<p>Adhatoda suaveolens, commonly known as the Indian Trumpet or Malabar Trumpet, is a flowering plant native to India and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves and flowers are used in traditional medicine for their medicinal properties, including expectorant and anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda suaveolens has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth texture, and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually 5â€“10 cm long, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The stem is slender, slightly woody, with a pale green to brownish bark that is smooth when young and becomes rough with age. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white or pale purple petals, and bloom during the rainy season; they are primarily pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda suaveolens is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of southern and southeastern Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is now also found in regions like the Caribbean and parts of the southern United States, where it has been introduced. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in forests, shrublands, and along riverbanks. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Adhatoda suaveolens is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, although its populations may be threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting in some areas.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda suaveolens is a tropical plant known for its medicinal properties and ornamental value, often cultivated for its fragrant leaves and flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. The plant has a warm-season growth cycle, thriving in USDA hardiness zones 10-12, and it flowers throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and regular watering, but it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and encourage new shoots. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while fungal diseases can occur in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>
