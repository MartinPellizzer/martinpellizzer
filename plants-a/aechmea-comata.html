                <h1>Aechmea comata</h1>
<p>Aechmea comata, commonly known as the woolly pineapple plant, is a bromeliad native to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage that forms a central cup to collect rainwater. The leaves are thick, leathery, and covered in a dense, woolly coating that gives the plant its common name. It produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea comata has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, strap-like, and dark green with a silvery underside, arranged in a compact spiral at the base.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, instead having a short, thick, and fibrous base that resembles a pseudostem. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, with pink to red flowers that bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry containing small seeds, which are dispersed by birds and mammals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in its bromeliad-like rosette structure.</p>
