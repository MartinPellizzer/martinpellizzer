<p>Aspalathus pachyloba subsp.</p>
<p>macroclada, commonly known as the large-leaved rooibos, is a shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its robust, woody stems and large, leathery, ovate leaves that are densely covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a distinctive member of the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>Although not commercially cultivated like the more common Aspalathus linearis, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its ecological and potential medicinal significance.</p>
