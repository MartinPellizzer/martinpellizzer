<p>Asclepias cornuta, commonly known as the horned milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like seed pods and its showy, pinkish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant contains a milky sap that is toxic to many animals but is a vital food source for monarch butterfly larvae. Its leaves are opposite and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are often reddish or purplish in color.</p>
<p>Asclepias cornuta plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is often found in prairies and open woodlands.</p>
