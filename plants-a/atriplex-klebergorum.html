<p>Atriplex klebergorum, commonly known as Kleber's saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are typically covered in a layer of fine, salt-excreting hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are adapted to attract pollinators in harsh environments. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in saline soils, making it an important component of arid ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife further highlights its ecological significance.</p>
