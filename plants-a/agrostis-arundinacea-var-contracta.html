                    <h1>Agrostis arundinacea var. contracta</h1>
<p>Agrostis arundinacea var. contracta, commonly known as narrowleaf basketgrass, is a grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
