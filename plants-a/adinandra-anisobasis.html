                <h1>Adinandra anisobasis</h1>
<p>Adinandra anisobasis, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The tree has simple, opposite leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, Adinandra anisobasis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra anisobasis has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra anisobasis is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this island, which is part of the Malay Archipelago. This plant thrives in humid and shaded environments, typically in lowland and hill forest areas. Its distribution is restricted to specific regions within Borneo, where the climate and soil conditions are suitable for its growth.</p>
<p>Adinandra anisobasis is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra anisobasis was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It thrives in lowland and hill forest environments, often found in secondary growth and disturbed areas. This plant is commonly found in Southeast Asia, including countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It has been introduced to other parts of the world as an ornamental or for reforestation purposes.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited due to its specific ecological requirements.</p>
