It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthopanax gracilistylus var. major is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in the provinces of Guangxi, Guangdong, and Yunnan.</p>
