<p>Angiopteris smithii, commonly known as the Smith's fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and colonize new areas. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Angiopteris smithii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
