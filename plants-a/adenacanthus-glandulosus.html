                <h1>Adenacanthus glandulosus</h1>
<p>Adenacanthus glandulosus, commonly known as the hairy adenacanthus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its glandular-stemmed structure and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are usually hairy, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to harsh climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenacanthus glandulosus has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a rough, reddish-brown bark, and exhibits a creeping growth pattern along the ground. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenacanthus glandulosus is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of South America, particularly in Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded areas within dense forests. This species is commonly associated with riverine and coastal habitats, where it benefits from high humidity and nutrient-rich soils. Its distribution is largely restricted to the Atlantic Forest and Pantanal regions, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Adenacanthus glandulosus is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenacanthus glandulosus was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fuzzy foliage and showy flowers.</p>
<p>It was likely brought by early settlers or horticulturalists who valued its aesthetic appeal. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. Despite its initial introduction for ornamental purposes, its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists.</p>
<p>Efforts are now being made to control its spread and mitigate its ecological impact.</p>
