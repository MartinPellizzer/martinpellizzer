<p>Achillea tanacetifolia, commonly known as yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Achillea tanacetifolia is also valued for its medicinal properties and historical use in herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea tanacetifolia has leaves that are lanceolate to elliptic in shape, with a finely toothed margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 2â€“6 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, herbaceous, and often branched, with a smooth, light green to gray-green bark. Its flowers are small, clustered in flat-topped umbels, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea tanacetifolia is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of Iran.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends into the western Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau, where it thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. This plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands at altitudes ranging from 2,000 to 4,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Achillea tanacetifolia is considered to be of conservation concern in some regions, although its status is not yet fully assessed at the global level.</p>
