                <h1>Achillea tanacetifolia</h1>
<p>Achillea tanacetifolia, commonly known as yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Its historical use dates back to ancient times for its medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea tanacetifolia has compound, finely divided, and gray-green leaves that are narrow and linear, arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a grayish-green color, growing in dense clusters. The flowers are small, yellow, and arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and deep, helping the plant to anchor and absorb water from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea tanacetifolia is primarily native to southern Europe, including countries such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, France, and parts of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is also found in the Mediterranean region, particularly in areas with dry, rocky, or calcareous soils. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often seen in open woodlands, meadows, and along coastal areas. Its distribution extends into some parts of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to sunny conditions and is commonly found in regions with mild winters and warm, dry summers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea tanacetifolia was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the western United States, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in various regions, often thriving in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction, which has contributed to its establishment in new areas. It is commonly found in meadows, roadsides, and other sunny, well-drained sites.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential varies depending on local environmental conditions and management practices.</p>
