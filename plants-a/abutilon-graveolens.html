                <h1>Abutilon graveolens</h1>
<p>Abutilon graveolens, commonly known as the stinkwood or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a strong, often unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the flowers are in full bloom. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to several meters in height, with a woody stem and fibrous roots.</p>
<p>Abutilon graveolens is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value, though its scent makes it less popular in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon graveolens has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and reddish-brown in color, with a tendency to branch out profusely. Its flowers are pendulous, with five pale yellow petals and a hairy calyx, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, aiding in water absorption in dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon graveolens is a flowering plant native to the southern United States, particularly Texas and northeastern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of Central America and the Caribbean, where it has been introduced. This species thrives in warm, humid environments, often growing in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open woodlands. It typically grows at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to about 500 meters.</p>
<p>Despite its widespread distribution, Abutilon graveolens is considered a conservation concern due to habitat loss and limited natural population sizes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon graveolens is a flowering plant known for its vibrant orange-red blooms and fuzzy leaves, often cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method for quick growth. The plant has a warm-season growth cycle, thriving in USDA zones 9-11, and it blooms from late spring to early autumn. It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings.</p>
<p>Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape and encourage flowering are recommended, while common pests like aphids and diseases such as root rot can be managed with proper care and companion plants like marigolds or lavender.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Abutilon graveolens is a versatile plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring crops by improving soil health. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving habitat structure in natural and agricultural environments.</p>
