Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that typically have separate male and female reproductive structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Lamiales, which includes a diverse group of flowering plants such as mint, snapdragon, and tobacco, often with showy flowers. Its family is Acanthaceae, a group of flowering plants commonly known as the spurred gentians, characterized by their distinctive spurred petals. Its genus is Acanthus, which includes several species of flowering plants known for their ornamental value and spiny leaves.</p>
<p>Its species is Acanthus polystachyus, a specific type of Acanthus plant native to certain regions of Africa, recognized for its unique appearance and ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
