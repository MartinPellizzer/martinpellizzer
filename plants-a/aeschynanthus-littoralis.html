                    <h1>Aeschynanthus littoralis</h1>
<p>Aeschynanthus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal twinflower, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that are typically bright red or orange, with two lobes that open to reveal a central corolla. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Aeschynanthus littoralis is often found growing near coastal areas, which suggests it has some degree of salt tolerance.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation.</p>
