                <h1>Adicea grandifolia</h1>
<p>Adicea grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered adicea, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a velvety texture, while its flowers range in color from pale pink to deep red.</p>
<p>Adicea grandifolia is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting local pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea grandifolia has leaves that are elongated, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and exhibits a creeping growth pattern, with a pale green bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and attracting pollinators such as bees through nectar production. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea grandifolia is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Tanzania, Kenya, and Mozambique.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly distributed in the Eastern and Southern parts of the African continent. It is also present in some areas of Madagascar and parts of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes humid woodlands and grasslands with high rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea grandifolia was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with ample sunlight and moderate to high levels of rainfall. The plant is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and abandoned fields. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has spread to several regions beyond its native range.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
