                <h1>Acis grandiflora</h1>
<p>Acis grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered acis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers with prominent yellow stamens. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Acis grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acis grandiflora has leaves that are typically elliptical or lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, slightly woody texture and a light grayish-brown color. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring five petals and a yellowish-orange color, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acis grandiflora is primarily native to the eastern and southeastern United States, including states such as Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, sandy soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. This plant thrives in coastal dunes, pine flatwoods, and wetlands, often in areas with high salt exposure. It is also present in parts of Texas and along the lower Mississippi River.</p>
<p>Acis grandiflora is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing dune environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acis grandiflora was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas. It has become naturalized in some parts of its introduced range, forming dense mats that can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is now considered a noxious weed in certain areas of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
