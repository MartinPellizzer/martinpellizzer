                <h1>Adenanthos meisneri</h1>
<p>Adenanthos meisneri, commonly known as the narrow-leaf adenanthos, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and showy, pinkish-red floral spikes. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. It is a shrub that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>Adenanthos meisneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthos meisneri has small, narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its flowers are clustered in umbel-like inflorescences, featuring pink to red petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos meisneri is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the south-west region of the state, particularly in the areas of the Fitzgerald River National Park and the nearby Jarrahdale region. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and heathlands. It is a small shrub that is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region.</p>
<p>Adenanthos meisneri is an important component of the local flora and is often seen in conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos meisneri was mainly introduced to South Australia and Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky habitats such as gorges, cliffs, and outcrops. The plant is well adapted to arid conditions and can survive with minimal water. It is often seen growing in association with other endemic species in these regions.</p>
<p>Its introduction has been largely due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging environments.</p>
