                    <h1>Argyreia aggregata var. osyrensis</h1>
<p>Argyreia aggregata var. osyrensis, commonly known as the red rafflesia, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fleshy, and intensely fragrant flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The flowers are typically red or orange with a white or yellow center, and they emit a strong, meaty odor to attract pollinators. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is also notable for its unique structure, with a fleshy, umbrella-shaped calyx that encloses the reproductive organs.</p>
