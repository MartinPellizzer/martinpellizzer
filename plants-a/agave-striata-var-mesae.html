<p>Agave striata var. mesae, commonly known as the Mesilla agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-gray in color. The leaves are lined with sharp, spiny margins and have a distinctive white to pale blue coloration due to the presence of a waxy coating. It produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, white flowers, which are typically pollinated by nocturnal insects.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established.</p>
