                        <h1>Acanthocereus pitajaya</h1>
<p>Acanthocereus pitajaya, commonly known as the Pitajaya cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus with a ribbed stem and spines that provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its structure and adaptations reflect its evolutionary response to harsh desert environments.</p>
