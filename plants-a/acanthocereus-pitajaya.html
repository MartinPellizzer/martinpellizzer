                        <h1>Acanthocereus pitajaya</h1>
<p>Acanthocereus pitajaya, commonly known as the Pitajaya cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus with a ribbed stem and spines that provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its structure and adaptations reflect its evolutionary response to harsh desert environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthocereus pitajaya is primarily native to the southern regions of the United States, particularly Arizona and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of northern Mexico, including the states of Sonora and Chihuahua. This cactus thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and on limestone formations. It is commonly found in desert scrublands and canyons where it receives full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthocereus pitajaya was mainly introduced to the tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in arid conditions. The plant is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant because of its low maintenance requirements. It has also been introduced to parts of the United States, particularly in states with warm climates.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems if it becomes invasive.</p>
