                            <h1>Armeria Pubigera</h1>
<p>Armeria pubigera is a low-growing flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is known for its dense clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. This species thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. Its compact form and showy blooms make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Despite its beauty, it is considered a rare and endangered plant due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
