                <h1>Aegilops macrochaeta</h1>
<p>Aegilops macrochaeta, commonly known as the hairy wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and long, narrow leaves with a distinctive hairy texture. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, making it monoecious. Its seeds are encased in tough, dark brown glumes, which aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Aegilops macrochaeta is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops macrochaeta has leaves that are narrow and grass-like, with a linear shape, alternate arrangement, and a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is upright and branching. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, pale blue to purple florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-angled spikelet containing three seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient water absorption in arid environments.</p>
