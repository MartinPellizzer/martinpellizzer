                <h1>Acrachne vatovae</h1>
<p>Acrachne vatovae, commonly known as the Socotra starfruit, is a unique flowering plant native to the island of Socotra.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Didiereaceae and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped fruits. The plant has a succulent, shrub-like appearance with thick, fleshy stems adapted to arid conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of yellow or green.</p>
<p>Due to its limited geographic distribution and specialized habitat, Acrachne vatovae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrachne vatovae has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow centers, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant in moist, nutrient-rich soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrachne vatovae is primarily native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>This plant is found in specific regions of the island, particularly in the eastern rainforests. It thrives in humid and tropical conditions with high rainfall. Its habitat is limited to certain elevations and microclimates within Madagascar.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrachne vatovae was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands through human activity, including accidental transport via shipping and intentional introduction for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>It has established itself in coastal and disturbed habitats, thriving in sandy soils and areas with high sunlight exposure. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction have led to its widespread presence in the region. Due to its invasive nature, it poses a threat to native vegetation by outcompeting local species for resources.</p>
<p>Efforts are currently being made to monitor and control its spread to prevent further ecological disruption.</p>
