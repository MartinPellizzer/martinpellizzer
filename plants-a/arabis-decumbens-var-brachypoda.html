<p>It features basal rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens.</p>
