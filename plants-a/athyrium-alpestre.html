<p>Athyrium alpestre, commonly known as the Alpine lady fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green and adorned with small, rounded lobes. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas at high altitudes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Athyrium alpestre is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
