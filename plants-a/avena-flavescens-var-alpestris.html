                    <h1>Avena flavescens var. alpestris</h1>
<p>Avena flavescens var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine oat, is a perennial grass native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with yellowish to golden florets, which are adapted to pollinate in alpine environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience to cold and poor soil conditions, it is an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
