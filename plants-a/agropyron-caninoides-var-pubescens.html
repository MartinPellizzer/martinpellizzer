                    <h1>Agropyron caninoides var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Agropyron caninoides var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy crested wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating drought, poor soil conditions, and grazing.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in erosion control and forage production due to its hardiness and rapid establishment.</p>
