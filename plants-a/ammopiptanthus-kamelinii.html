<p>Ammopiptanthus kamelinii, commonly known as the desert peashrub, is a shrub native to arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, compound leaves and pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it access water from underground sources. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
