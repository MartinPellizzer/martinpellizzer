                <h1>Acrostichum luridum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum luridum, commonly known as the golden hibiscus, is a species of flowering plant in the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its large, showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a rough texture.</p>
<p>Acrostichum luridum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum luridum has large, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and has a smooth, light brown bark, growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dark, round drupe that contains one seed, which is dispersed by water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in wet, marshy environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum luridum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Pacific Islands, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is commonly found in mangrove swamps and tidal forests. This plant is well adapted to saline and brackish water conditions, which are typical of its natural habitat. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to areas with consistent moisture and warm temperatures year-round.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum luridum was mainly introduced to coastal and wetland areas where it thrives in humid, saline environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high rainfall and poor drainage, such as mangrove swamps and salt marshes. This plant is often spread through human activity, including landscaping and accidental transport via water or wind. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to outcompete native species in these sensitive ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for certain wildlife.</p>
