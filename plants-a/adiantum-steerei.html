                <h1>Adiantum steerei</h1>
<p>Adiantum steerei, commonly known as the Steere's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive black midrib that contrasts with the light green fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum steerei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum steerei has fern-like leaves that are bipinnate, with a delicate, lacey appearance, typically measuring up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and upright, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark. This plant does not produce flowers; instead, it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Its fronds bear sporangia on the underside, and the spores are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum steerei is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically found in the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It is commonly distributed in states such as Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forests or along stream banks. It is typically found in the Appalachian Mountains and the coastal plain regions.</p>
<p>Adiantum steerei is a rare and delicate species that prefers acidic soils and high humidity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum steerei was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and stream sides. This fern has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California. It is often associated with disturbed sites and can spread rapidly in suitable conditions.</p>
<p>Its presence in these areas is a result of both natural dispersal and human activity.</p>
