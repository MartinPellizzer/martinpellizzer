                    <h1>Artemisia pygmaea</h1>
<p>Artemisia pygmaea, commonly known as dwarf sage, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage with small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces tiny yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer and early fall. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Artemisia pygmaea also has historical uses in traditional medicine for its aromatic and antiseptic properties.</p>
