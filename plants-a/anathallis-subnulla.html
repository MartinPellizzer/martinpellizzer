                    <h1>Anathallis subnulla</h1>
<p>Anathallis subnulla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers and lacks the typical green leaves found in most orchids, instead relying on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant is epiphytic, growing on the trunks of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it highly vulnerable to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this rare botanical wonder.</p>
