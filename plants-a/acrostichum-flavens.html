                <h1>Acrostichum flavens</h1>
<p>Acrostichum flavens, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green to yellowish in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>The golden fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum flavens has broad, leathery leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 10 to 30 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a dense, bushy pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, with each seed having a wing-like structure for easy flight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum flavens is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Oceania, including New Guinea and some Pacific islands, where it has been introduced. It thrives in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and swampy areas. Acrostichum flavens is typically found at low altitudes, often below 500 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its habitat is threatened by deforestation and land conversion, which may impact its long-term survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acrostichum flavens is a striking ornamental fern known for its vibrant yellow fronds and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through spores or by dividing the rhizomes, with the latter method being more reliable for gardeners. This plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity in about two to three years, making it ideal for long-term landscaping.</p>
