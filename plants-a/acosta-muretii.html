                <h1>Acosta muretii</h1>
<p>Acosta muretii, commonly known as the Muretii acosta, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, with small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare species with specific ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta muretii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exhibits a slight furrowed texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta muretii is primarily native to the Andean region of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude areas, typically between 2,500 and 4,000 meters above sea level. This plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on slopes or in mountainous terrains. It is adapted to the cold and dry conditions typical of the Andes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta muretii was mainly introduced to areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it suitable for coastal and inland regions. This plant is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and urban landscapes. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions beyond its native range.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems remains under study.</p>
