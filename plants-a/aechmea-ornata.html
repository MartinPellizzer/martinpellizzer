                <h1>Aechmea ornata</h1>
<p>Aechmea ornata, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of stiff, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-like inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its foliage is often variegated with white or silver markings, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Aechmea ornata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea ornata has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, stiff, and sword-like, arranged in a tight spiral around the plantâ€™s central axis, with a waxy, blue-green color and a sharp, pointed tip.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead forming a dense, compact rosette with a central rosette that holds the inflorescence. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix surrounded by colorful bracts, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow, and bloom during the summer months, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for water absorption, helping the plant thrive in humid, tropical environments.</p>
