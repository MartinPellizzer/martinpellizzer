                <h1>Acrostichum microlepis</h1>
<p>Acrostichum microlepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf brake, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae).</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright fronds with a dense arrangement of small, linear leaves. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Acrostichum microlepis is characterized by its delicate, finely divided foliage and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum microlepis has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows in a climbing or trailing pattern. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers with three petals and three sepals, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-parted capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant, often growing in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum microlepis is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid environments with poor to moderately drained soils. Its distribution extends into parts of the Caribbean as well.</p>
<p>It is often associated with coastal and floodplain areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum microlepis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for ornamental purposes due to its attractive fronds.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several countries including the United States, Australia, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and can often be found near water bodies or in disturbed habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in non-native regions.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread and minimize ecological impacts.</p>
