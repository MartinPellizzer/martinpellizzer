                    <h1>Ascochilus pulvinatus</h1>
<p>Ascochilus pulvinatus, commonly known as the purple ghost orchid, is a rare and unusual orchid species native to the wetlands of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with elongated, pale purple flowers that resemble spectral forms. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered a threatened species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
