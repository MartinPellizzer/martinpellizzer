<p>Allocasuarina acutivalvis subsp.</p>
<p>acutivalvis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved she-oak, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, needle-like leaves that are closely clustered around the stems.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in woody cones and are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
