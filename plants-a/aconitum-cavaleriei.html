                <h1>Aconitum cavaleriei</h1>
<p>Aconitum cavaleriei, commonly known as the Chinese aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, spikelike inflorescences. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>Aconitum cavaleriei contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum cavaleriei has palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure up to 20 cm in diameter, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petal-like sepals and numerous yellow stamens, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients and water.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum cavaleriei is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates at high elevations, often found in forested areas and rocky slopes. This plant is adapted to cool, moist environments and is commonly associated with alpine vegetation. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum cavaleriei was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue-violet flowers and attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and spreads rapidly through its rhizomes.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
