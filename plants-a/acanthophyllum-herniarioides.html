                        <h1>Acanthophyllum herniarioides</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum herniarioides, commonly known as the desert holly, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise rugged appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing transpiration and enhancing drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Acanthophyllum herniarioides plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
