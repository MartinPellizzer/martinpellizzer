                <h1>Adiantum neoguineense</h1>
<p>Adiantum neoguineense, commonly known as the New Guinea maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that resemble those of the common maidenhair fern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a glossy appearance, with a distinctive rachis that is slightly grooved.</p>
<p>Adiantum neoguineense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum neoguineense has frond-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance, typically arranged in a rosette pattern and ranging from 10 to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green, with a glossy surface and finely serrated margins. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a creeping or ascending pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures rather than true flowers, and the spores are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum neoguineense is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in the western and central regions. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments along stream banks and in mountainous areas. It is commonly observed in the undergrowth of primary and secondary forests.</p>
<p>The plant's distribution is largely restricted to the unique ecological conditions of New Guinea.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum neoguineense was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests, stream banks, and rocky crevices. The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its delicate, fern-like fronds. Its introduction has been largely accidental, through seed dispersal by wind or water.</p>
<p>It has become naturalized in several areas, sometimes posing a challenge to native vegetation.</p>
