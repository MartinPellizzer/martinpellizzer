                <h1>Acosta chaubardii</h1>
<p>Acosta chaubardii, commonly known as the Chaubard's acosta, is a species of flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes a wide variety of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta chaubardii has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lance-shaped leaflets that are glossy green and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its small, white flowers are clustered in racemes, bloom in early spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in rocky or arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta chaubardii is primarily native to Central America, particularly in countries such as Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in humid, shaded environments. This plant thrives in areas with rich, well-drained soil and high moisture levels. It is typically associated with forests and understory vegetation.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific geographic regions within Central America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta chaubardii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and riverbanks.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in temperate climates, particularly in regions of South America where it is native. Its introduction to new areas has been largely due to human activities, including accidental dispersal through agricultural practices.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in non-native environments.</p>
