                    <h1>Avicennia elliptica</h1>
<p>Avicennia elliptica, commonly known as the mangrove button or sea bean, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized aerial roots called pneumatophores that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, aiding in buoyancy and photosynthesis. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Avicennia elliptica plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and filtering pollutants from tidal waters.</p>
