                            <h1>Asystasia Gangetica Subsp. Micrantha</h1>
<p>Gangetic asystasia, scientifically known as Asystasia gangetica subsp. micrantha, is a lesser-known yet ecologically significant plant native to the Indian subcontinent. This perennial herb thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth and along riverbanks. Its striking violet to purple flowers bloom in clusters, making it a visually appealing addition to botanical gardens and natural habitats. Despite its beauty, it remains underappreciated and understudied in modern horticulture. Understanding its biology and ecological role is crucial for conservation efforts and sustainable plant use.</p>
