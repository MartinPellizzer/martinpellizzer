                <h1>Acer × koenighoferae</h1>
<p>Acer × koenighoferae, commonly known as the Koenighofer's maple, is a hybrid deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Acer ginnala and Acer negundo.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 6–12 meters with a broad, rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a serrated margin, and turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer × koenighoferae has palmate leaves that are typically 5-7 lobed, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils it prefers.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer × koenighoferae is a hybrid maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in the Alps and Carpathians.</p>
<p>Although it was originally a natural hybrid, its current distribution is primarily limited to cultivation due to its rarity in the wild. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, often found in forested areas or along rocky slopes. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 800 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural occurrence and reliance on human cultivation, Acer × koenighoferae is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer × koenighoferae is a hybrid maple tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seed propagation requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The tree grows slowly, reaching maturity over several decades, and thrives in temperate climates with full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, fertile soil and moderate watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Regular fertilization in early spring and annual pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer × koenighoferae is a hybrid maple tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers. The tree acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the aesthetic and ecological value of the landscape. Its deep root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality, making it beneficial for local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer × koenighoferae is a hybrid maple species primarily valued for its ornamental use in horticulture due to its striking foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas in certain cultural contexts. In medicinal applications, it has been explored for its potential antioxidant properties, though research is limited. Industrially, it contributes to the timber and paper industries in regions where it is cultivated.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty in botanical gardens and landscape design, enhancing urban aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer × koenighoferae has a limited number of naturally occurring hybrids, primarily resulting from crosses between *Acer rubrum* (red maple) and *Acer saccharum* (sugar maple).</p>
<p>Some popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Emerald Queen', which are valued for their vibrant fall color and ornamental appeal. These hybrids are often selected for their enhanced hardiness and unique foliage characteristics. Horticulturally, Acer × koenighoferae is important for its role in landscape design and its contribution to the genetic diversity of maple species.</p>
<p>Its cultivation also supports ecological benefits, such as providing food and habitat for wildlife.</p>
