<p>Acer oliverianum, commonly known as the Oliver's maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
