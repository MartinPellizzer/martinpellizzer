                <h1>Acer oliverianum</h1>
<p>Acer oliverianum, commonly known as the Oliver's maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red or orange foliage that turns vibrant in the fall. The tree has palmate leaves with five lobes, and its flowers are small, greenish-yellow catkins. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for gardens and parks.</p>
<p>The Oliver's maple is valued for its ornamental beauty and adaptability to various climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 4 to 8 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching pattern that is generally upright. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicle inflorescences during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. Its fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, acidic soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited to a few scattered locations, often in remote and protected habitats. It thrives in moist, temperate environments with well-drained soil, typically found in forest understories. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Acer oliverianum is listed as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts to prevent its extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum is a small, ornamental maple known for its vibrant autumn foliage and unique, twisted trunk.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. This species has a slow growth cycle, often reaching maturity over several decades, making it ideal for long-term landscape planning.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires regular watering during dry periods without becoming waterlogged. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of balanced fertilizer in spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and encourage healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving perennials or ferns enhances its aesthetic appeal in woodland gardens.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum is a small deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers in spring. Its dense canopy acts as a companion plant, offering shade and protection to smaller plants in the understory. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity of its habitat by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum is a small deciduous tree native to the Himalayas, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In industrial contexts, it contributes to local biodiversity and provides habitat for various wildlife species. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in some regions, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its role in reforestation and soil stabilization also makes it important for environmental conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aureum', known for its golden foliage, and 'Variegatum', which features striking variegated leaves. Hybrids of Acer oliverianum are often created to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and leaf coloration. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions.</p>
<p>They are widely cultivated in temperate climates for their unique visual characteristics and seasonal interest.</p>
