                <h1>Acer oliverianum</h1>
<p>Acer oliverianum, commonly known as the Oliver's maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, turning yellow to orange in the fall. The stem is slender with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to rocky and well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Pakistan.</p>
<p>While its native range was once broader, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Pamir and Tian Shan mountain ranges. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soils, typically found in forested areas at altitudes between 2,500 and 4,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, Acer oliverianum is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum is a small, ornamental maple known for its vibrant autumn foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. This plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 10 to 15 years, and thrives in well-drained, loamy soil with moderate watering. Fertilize it in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and encourage new growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with shade-loving companion plants like ferns or heathers.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring blossoms and produces edible fruits that are consumed by birds and small mammals. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a wide range of flora and fauna. Its extensive root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along riverbanks and slopes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality through its photosynthetic processes.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use but is appreciated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Its leaves and bark have been traditionally used in some indigenous medicinal practices for their potential anti-inflammatory and astringent properties. While not widely used in industrial applications, it contributes to local biodiversity and supports ecosystem health. In cultural contexts, it may symbolize resilience and natural beauty in regions where it grows.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems makes it valuable for conservation efforts in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Variegatum', known for its striking variegated leaves, and 'Atrosanguineum', which displays deep red foliage in autumn. Hybrids of Acer oliverianum are often created to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and leaf coloration. These plants hold horticultural importance due to their unique appearance and adaptability to various garden conditions.</p>
<p>They are widely cultivated in temperate regions for their aesthetic appeal and seasonal interest.</p>
