                <h1>Acalypha juruana</h1>
<p>Acalypha juruana, commonly known as the golden flame plant, is a tropical shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant has simple, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Acalypha juruana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant, long-lasting foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha juruana has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length and a color that varies from green to reddish-purple.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and has a smooth, pale green bark with a slightly fibrous texture, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with a yellowish-green color, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a shallow network near the soil surface, aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha juruana is a species native to the Amazon Basin, primarily found in northern South America, including countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>While it was once widespread in its native range, its current distribution is fragmented due to habitat loss and human activity. It thrives in moist, tropical rainforests and is often found near streams or in shaded understory areas. The plant typically grows at altitudes between 200 and 600 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its limited distribution and habitat degradation pose threats to its long-term survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha juruana is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with stem cuttings being the most reliable method for quick results. This plant typically has a rapid growth cycle, thriving in warm climates and reaching maturity within a few months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and occasional pruning to shape the plant and encourage bushiness are recommended. While it is generally resistant to pests and diseases, it may occasionally attract aphids or mealybugs, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acalypha juruana is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, colorful flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in agroforestry systems, enhancing the growth of other crops. Its dense foliage helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity of the ecosystem by supporting a range of flora and fauna.</p>
