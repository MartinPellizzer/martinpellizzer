                <h1>Achillea millii</h1>
<p>Achillea millii, commonly known as yellow archangel, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and aromatic, fern-like foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millii has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“15 cm in length, with a grayish-green color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and often branching, with a smooth, greenish-gray bark that becomes more woody with age. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus of bristles that aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millii is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends to the Canary Islands and some areas of southern Spain. This species thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to around 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Achillea millii is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millii is a hardy perennial known for its vibrant, daisy-like flowers that thrive in full sun.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late winter. The plant has a long growth cycle, blooming from late spring to early fall, with a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding overwatering to prevent root rot. Fertilize with a balanced fertilizer in spring, and prune spent flowers to encourage continuous blooming. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea millii is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, due to its showy yellow flowers and abundant nectar. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants by attracting beneficial insects. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing slopes and sandy soils.</p>
