<p>Aristida kelleri, commonly known as Keller's grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it access underground water sources.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping and as a forage plant in dry environments.</p>
