                    <h1>Arenaria modesta var. trachysperma</h1>
<p>Arenaria modesta var. trachysperma, commonly known as the rough-fruited sandparsley, is a low-growing perennial plant native to dry, rocky habitats in the western United States.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its fruit is a small, ribbed achene, which is adapted for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils, making it an important component of its native ecosystem.</p>
