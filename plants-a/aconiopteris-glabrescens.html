<p>Aconiopteris glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are usually glabrous, or smooth, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new fronds, contributing to its ability to spread in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
