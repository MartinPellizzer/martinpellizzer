<p>Austrostipa tenuifolia, commonly known as slender-berry grass, is a flowering plant native to southern South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its drought-resistant features. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Austrostipa tenuifolia plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates.</p>
