<p>Abutilon macrum, commonly known as the woolly abutilon, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring broad, heart-shaped leaves with a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds.</p>
<p>Abutilon macrum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon macrum has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy and range in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dull green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>Its stems are hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody as the plant matures, growing in a spreading or shrub-like pattern. The flowers are showy, with five petals forming a bell-shaped structure, typically pink or red, blooming in spring and summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon macrum is a species native to the island of Madagascar, where it occurs in specific regions of the eastern rainforests.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to these areas, with no known populations outside Madagascar. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. The plant grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, Abutilon macrum is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon macrum is a fast-growing, tropical shrub known for its showy, lantern-shaped flowers and velvety foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method for quick results. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a year under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil with regular watering, but it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilize with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and prune to maintain shape and encourage blooming. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its ornamental appeal.</p>
