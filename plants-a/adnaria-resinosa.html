                <h1>Adnaria resinosa</h1>
<p>Adnaria resinosa, commonly known as the resinous adnaria, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces a milky latex sap, which is one of its distinguishing features. Adnaria resinosa typically grows in coastal areas and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria resinosa has small, ovate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring up to 2 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria resinosa is primarily native to the southern regions of the Arabian Peninsula, including countries such as Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Oman.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in coastal areas and along rocky shores. This plant is commonly associated with coastal dunes and sandy soils, where it adapts to high temperatures and low rainfall. It plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria resinosa was mainly introduced to coastal areas and estuaries where it can thrive in brackish water conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with moderate temperatures and low salinity. This plant is often associated with mangrove ecosystems and can tolerate periodic flooding. Its introduction has been linked to both natural dispersal and human activities such as coastal development.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities.</p>
