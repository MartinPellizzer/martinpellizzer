                <h1>Achillea neilreichii</h1>
<p>Achillea neilreichii, commonly known as Neilreich's yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Its flowering period occurs in late summer, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea neilreichii has basal leaves that are lanceolate, with a grayish-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern and measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, slightly reddish-brown bark, and grows from the base of the plant, forming a compact, herbaceous structure. Its flowers are composite, consisting of white ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry achene, with small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in rocky or disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea neilreichii is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found in rocky soils and open slopes at high elevations. This species is adapted to the cold and harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. It is commonly found in the Pamir and Tien Shan mountain ranges.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea neilreichii was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, daisy-like flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and disturbed soils across the United States and Canada. The plant has spread beyond cultivated areas, becoming naturalized in some regions, particularly in the western United States. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is important to monitor its distribution to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
