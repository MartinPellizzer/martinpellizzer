                <h1>Achyrospermum axillare</h1>
<p>Achyrospermum axillare, commonly known as the velvetleaf or blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves and clusters of small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common weed in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability contribute to its success in various environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum axillare has leaves that are opposite in arrangement, ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a rough texture and a dark green color, typically ranging from 3 to 8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, somewhat hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark, growing upright with some branching. The flowers are clustered in cymes, with five pink to purple petals, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum axillare is primarily native to DR Congo, Sudan-South Sudan, and Uganda.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland areas. The species is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific geographic regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrospermum axillare was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since spread across various regions, including coastal and inland areas. The plant thrives in a range of soil types and is drought-tolerant, contributing to its successful establishment. It is now considered a potential weed in some parts of New Zealand, particularly in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological impacts of non-native species in new environments.</p>
