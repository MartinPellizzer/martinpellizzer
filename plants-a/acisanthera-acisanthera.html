                <h1>Acisanthera acisanthera</h1>
<p>Acisanthera acisanthera, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, yellow tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Acisanthera acisanthera is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its vibrant and unique floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acisanthera acisanthera has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively unchanging throughout the plant's life. Its flowers are small, clustered in loose inflorescences, featuring five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera acisanthera is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, growing in open grasslands and rocky soils. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry climate of its native habitat. It is often seen in coastal and inland areas where the climate is warm and dry.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in local horticulture and landscaping.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera acisanthera was mainly introduced to the eastern and southeastern regions of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought in during the early 20th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions have led to its classification as an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>However, it is still commonly used in gardens and landscaping due to its aesthetic value.</p>
