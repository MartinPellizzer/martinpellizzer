                    <h1>Azolla</h1>
<p>Azolla, commonly known as water fern, is a genus of aquatic ferns that thrive in shallow freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It forms dense floating mats on the surface of ponds and rice fields, contributing to nutrient cycling and water oxygenation. Azolla is notable for its symbiotic relationship with the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Anabaena azollae, which enhances its ability to enrich soil with nitrogen. The plant's rapid growth rate makes it an effective biofertilizer in agriculture.</p>
<p>Its unique structure includes small, water-filled fronds and specialized reproductive structures that aid in propagation.</p>
