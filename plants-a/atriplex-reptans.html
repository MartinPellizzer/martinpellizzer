<p>Atriplex reptans, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in sandy or loose soils.</p>
<p>Atriplex reptans is adapted to thrive in harsh conditions, making it an important species in desert ecosystems.</p>
