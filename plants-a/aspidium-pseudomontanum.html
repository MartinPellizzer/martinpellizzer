<p>Aspidium pseudomontanum, commonly known as the false mountain maidenhair, is a fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, slender, and often arching growth habit. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity.</p>
<p>Aspidium pseudomontanum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded gardens.</p>
