<p>Adelphacme, commonly known as the "false mallow," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically herbaceous and can be found in various habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils. They produce small, often hairy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Adelphacme species are often used in ecological studies due to their adaptability and role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
