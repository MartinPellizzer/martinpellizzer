                            <h1>Allium Stevenii F. Condensatum</h1>
<p>Steven's onion, scientifically known as Allium stevenii f. condensatum, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Sierra Nevada mountains. This bulbous plant is characterized by its compact growth and distinctive onion-like odor, which sets it apart from other members of the Allium family. Despite its small size, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting local pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Steven's onion is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
