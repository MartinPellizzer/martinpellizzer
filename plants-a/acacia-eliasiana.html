<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the eastern coast, often in open forests and heathlands. This species thrives in temperate to subtropical climates and is well adapted to the local environmental conditions. It plays an important role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various native animals.</p>
<p>Acacia eliasiana is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia eliasiana was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>It has been widely used for its hardy nature, making it a popular choice for reforestation and land stabilization projects. The plant's rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing capabilities have contributed to its successful establishment in various ecosystems. However, its invasive potential in some areas has raised concerns about ecological impact.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, Acacia eliasiana remains an important species in both agricultural and environmental contexts.</p>
