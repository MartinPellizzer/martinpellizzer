                <h1>Achimenes atrosanguinea</h1>
<p>Achimenes atrosanguinea, commonly known as the black blood achimenes, is a striking tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black, velvety flowers that contrast sharply with its green foliage. The plant produces showy, tubular blooms that are typically pink to red in color, though the name suggests a darker hue. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Achimenes atrosanguinea is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes atrosanguinea has heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. Its flowers are tubular with a deep red corolla, featuring a prominent yellow throat, and bloom from summer to autumn, primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes atrosanguinea is primarily native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is found in the states of Pará, Amazonas, and Amapá, where the climate is humid and warm. This plant thrives in lowland areas with rich, moist soil, often near rivers or in dense rainforests. It is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which is one of the most biodiverse regions in the world.</p>
<p>Due to its striking flowers, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and as an ornamental plant in some parts of the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes atrosanguinea was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for ornamental purposes due to its striking red and purple flowers.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant because of its ability to thrive in warm, humid climates. The plant is typically found in countries such as Australia, New Zealand, and parts of the United States, where it has been intentionally introduced. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for shaded borders or containers.</p>
<p>Although it is not considered invasive in most regions, it requires careful management to prevent unintended spread.</p>
