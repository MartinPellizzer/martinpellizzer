                <h1>Achnatherum nevadense</h1>
<p>Achnatherum nevadense, commonly known as Sierra grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration.</p>
<p>Achnatherum nevadense plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum nevadense has slender, grass-like leaves that are typically linear, narrow, and slightly pointed, with a bluish-green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, often forming dense clumps, with a light green to reddish-brown color and a smooth, slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with pale blue to lavender colors, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-angled seed enclosed in a dry, bristle-like structure, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and stabilize soil in its arid habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum nevadense is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in the Great Basin and the Sierra Nevada mountains.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and rocky slopes. This grass species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. It is well adapted to the dry climate and can tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Achnatherum nevadense plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum nevadense was mainly introduced to disturbed sites such as roadsides, railroads, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, open habitats with well-drained soils. This plant is often found in the western United States, particularly in California, Nevada, and Utah. Its introduction has led to its establishment in areas where it competes with native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can spread rapidly in these environments.</p>
