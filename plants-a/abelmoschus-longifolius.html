<p>The stem is erect and somewhat woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured as the plant matures. The flowers are showy, with five petals and a yellow center, blooming in summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelmoschus longifolius is a flowering plant native to southern Asia, particularly India and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is now found in various parts of the world, including Africa, the Americas, and the Caribbean, often as an introduced species. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as threatened, its wild populations are under pressure due to habitat loss and overharvesting.</p>
