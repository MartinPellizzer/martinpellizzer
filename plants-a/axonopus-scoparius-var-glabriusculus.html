                    <h1>Axonopus scoparius var. glabriusculus</h1>
<p>Axonopus scoparius var. glabriusculus, commonly known as the smooth axonopus, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or marshy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
