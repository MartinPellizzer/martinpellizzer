                <h1>Acrostichum auricomum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum auricomum, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Dicksoniaceae family and is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that can form dense mats. Its leaves are typically bright green with a yellowish or golden hue on the underside, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forests or along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum auricomum has large, broad, sickle-shaped leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, measuring up to 1 meter in length and 30 centimeters in width, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is robust and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows in a clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum auricomum is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean islands, including the Greater and Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of southern Florida and the Bahamas, though its distribution has been significantly reduced. This plant thrives in wet, swampy areas and along the edges of freshwater bodies, often in brackish or saline environments. It typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 50 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, it is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>[WRONG START] Acrostichum auricum is a hardy, shade-tolerant plant known for its vibrant, sword-like leaves.</p>
