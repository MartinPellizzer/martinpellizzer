                    <h1>Althaea dissecta</h1>
<p>Althaea dissecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped, deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Althaea dissecta thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its mucilage-rich roots.</p>
