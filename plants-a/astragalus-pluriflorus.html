                    <h1>Astragalus pluriflorus</h1>
<p>Astragalus pluriflorus, commonly known as the many-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow to reddish-purple pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and disturbed sites. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Its seeds are small and typically dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
