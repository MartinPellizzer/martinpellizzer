                    <h1>Agrostis rockii</h1>
<p>Agrostis rockii, commonly known as the Rockgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two to three flowers. Agrostis rockii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Its low-growing form and drought tolerance make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
