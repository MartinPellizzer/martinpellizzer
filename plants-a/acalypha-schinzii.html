<p>Acalypha schinzii, commonly known as the Schinz's spurflower, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa, particularly Tanzania and Kenya.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, wooded areas. The plant is characterized by its attractive, spiky bracts that form a showy inflorescence, often mistaken for flowers. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, inconspicuous true flowers within the bracts.</p>
<p>Acalypha schinzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha schinzii has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale green to reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with bisexual flowers that are pale green to yellowish in color, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara, dispersed by wind due to its light, feathery structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
