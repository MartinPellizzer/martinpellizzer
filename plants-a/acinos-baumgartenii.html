                <h1>Acinos baumgartenii</h1>
<p>Acinos baumgartenii, commonly known as the Sierra acino, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, thriving at high elevations. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The small yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos baumgartenii has narrow, linear to lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem, with a grayish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark, and exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, blooming in early summer; they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when the pod dries and splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos baumgartenii is primarily native to the western United States, specifically found in California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It grows in rocky and gravelly habitats, often in open areas with full sun exposure. This plant is commonly found in the Sierra Nevada and Great Basin regions. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Acinos baumgartenii is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos baumgartenii was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the western states such as California, Oregon, and Washington.</p>
<p>It was brought in during the early 20th century as part of ornamental plant introductions. This plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats like meadows and slopes. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some natural areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered to have a limited ecological impact compared to other non-native species.</p>
