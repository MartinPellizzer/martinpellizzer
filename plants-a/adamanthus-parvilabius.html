                <h1>Adamanthus parvilabius</h1>
<p>Adamanthus parvilabius, commonly known as the small-lobed hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It has palmately lobed leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Adamanthus parvilabius is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adamanthus parvilabius has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with small, ovate leaflets measuring up to 2 cm in length, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, white to cream-colored, clustered in terminal panicles, and bloom from May to July, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamanthus parvilabius is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil.</p>
<p>This species is found in the states of Espírito Santo, São Paulo, and Paraná. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. The plant is typically found in secondary forests and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamanthus parvilabius was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in regions with a warm, temperate climate.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas where it serves as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. The distribution of this plant has expanded beyond its native range, particularly in the southeastern United States. It thrives in environments with moderate rainfall and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
