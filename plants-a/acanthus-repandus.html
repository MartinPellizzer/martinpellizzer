                <h1>Acanthus repandus</h1>
<p>Acanthus repandus, commonly known as the broadleaved acanthus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Acanthaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, tubular flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks.</p>
<p>The plant has ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage and floral displays.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acanthus repandus has leaves that are broad, palmately lobed, and typically measure up to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is upright and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark. The plant produces spikes of spathaceous flowers in late spring to early summer, featuring white to pale pink petals and a complex structure that attracts both insects and birds for pollination. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthus repandus is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to specific areas in southern Europe, particularly in countries like Spain, Portugal, and southern France. It thrives in rocky, coastal environments and dry, sunny slopes, often growing in disturbed or marginal habitats. This species is typically found at low to moderate altitudes, generally below 500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acanthus repandus is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acanthus repandus is a striking, evergreen perennial known for its dramatic, palmate leaves and showy spires of blue or violet flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, division, or stem cuttings, with the latter being the most reliable method for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil, with regular watering during the growing season to maintain moist but not waterlogged conditions. Fertilize it with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring, and prune spent flower stalks after blooming to encourage new growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions, and it pairs well with lavender, sedum, and other drought-tolerant plants in garden settings.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acanthus repandus is a hardy perennial plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, spiny leaves and clusters of small flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its dense foliage. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions in its habitat.</p>
