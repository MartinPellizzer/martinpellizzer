<p>Arctostaphylos canescens f. candidissima, commonly known as the whiteleaf manzanita, is a variant of the manzanita shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost white, foliage that distinguishes it from other manzanita species. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, which bloom in late spring. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and covered in a fine, whitish coating that reflects light.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
