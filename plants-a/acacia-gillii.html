                    <h1>Acacia gillii</h1>
<p>Acacia gillii, commonly known as the white wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of South Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The leaves are small, phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that perform the function of true leaves. Acacia gillii is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
