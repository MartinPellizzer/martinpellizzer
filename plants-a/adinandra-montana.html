<p>Adinandra montana, commonly known as the mountain adinandra, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is a small evergreen shrub, typically growing up to 2 meters in height. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a glossy surface.</p>
<p>It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, often blooming during the dry season.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra montana has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra montana is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forests, often growing in shaded understory environments. This species thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils, typically in primary and secondary forests. Adinandra montana is also present in parts of eastern India and the Andaman Islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with areas that have a rich diversity of evergreen and semi-evergreen forests.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra montana was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded habitats such as montane forests and hillside thickets.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures, typically found in tropical and subtropical climates. This plant is often found in secondary growth areas and can establish itself in disturbed soils. Its introduction has been noted in several countries across Southeast Asia and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing shelter and food for various fauna.</p>
