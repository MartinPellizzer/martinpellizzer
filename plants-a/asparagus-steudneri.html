                    <h1>Asparagus steudneri</h1>
<p>Asparagus steudneri, commonly known as the desert asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features slender, woody stems that often branch at the base and produce small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water.</p>
<p>Asparagus steudneri is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
