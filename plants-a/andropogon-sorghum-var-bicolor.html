<p>Andropogon sorghum var. bicolor, commonly known as sorghum, is a tall, warm-season grass native to Africa.</p>
<p>It features erect stems that can grow up to 3â€“4 meters in height, with large, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, two-lipped flowers. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought.</p>
