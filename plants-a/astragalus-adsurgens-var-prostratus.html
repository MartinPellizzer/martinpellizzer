<p>Astragalus adsurgens var. prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming habit with slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
