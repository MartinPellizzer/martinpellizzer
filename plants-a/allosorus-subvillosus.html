                    <h1>Allosorus subvillosus</h1>
<p>Allosorus subvillosus, commonly known as the woolly alpine lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly appearance, which helps it retain moisture in harsh alpine conditions. The thallus is typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a slightly leathery texture. It forms symbiotic relationships with algae and fungi, contributing to its ability to survive in nutrient-poor substrates.</p>
<p>This lichen is often found on rocks and tree trunks in mountainous regions.</p>
