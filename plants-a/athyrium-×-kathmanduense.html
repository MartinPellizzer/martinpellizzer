<p>Athyrium × kathmanduense, commonly known as the hybrid lady fern, is a deciduous fern native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Athyrium filix-femina and Athyrium niponicum, exhibiting a mix of characteristics from both parent species. The plant features elegant, bipinnate fronds with a light green to bronze coloration, often with a reddish hue on the underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is typically propagated through spores or division rather than seeds.</p>
