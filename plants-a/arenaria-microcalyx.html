                    <h1>Arenaria microcalyx</h1>
<p>Arenaria microcalyx, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by round, greenish fruits that mature into small, dry capsules. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Arenaria microcalyx is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
