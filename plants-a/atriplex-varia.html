<p>Atriplex varia, commonly known as the variable saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-green foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to minimize transpiration. It produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Atriplex varia is often used in rehabilitation of degraded soils due to its tolerance to saline and drought conditions.</p>
