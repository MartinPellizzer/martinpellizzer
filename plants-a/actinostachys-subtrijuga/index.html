                            <h1>Actinostachys Subtrijuga</h1>
<p>Cinnamon fern, scientifically known as Actinostachys subtrijuga, is a striking native plant of the eastern United States and southeastern Canada. With its unique appearance featuring a tall, arching frond and a dense cluster of spore-bearing structures at the base, it stands out in woodland settings. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest floors. Its common name comes from the cinnamon-like scent released when the spore heads are disturbed. Despite its delicate look, the cinnamon fern is resilient and plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems.</p>
