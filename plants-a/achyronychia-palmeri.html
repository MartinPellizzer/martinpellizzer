                <h1>Achyronychia palmeri</h1>
<p>Achyronychia palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's achyronychia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in arid environments and is often found in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronychia palmeri has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly woody, with a rough, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with pale blue to lavender petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and attracting pollinators such as bees and flies through its fragrant scent. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronychia palmeri is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. This plant thrives in desert environments, including parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. It is often associated with limestone or clay soils in desertscrub habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronychia palmeri was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in areas with dry, rocky soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in desert regions such as Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. This plant is often associated with disturbed sites and can thrive in areas with limited water availability. Its introduction has been linked to both natural dispersal and human activities.</p>
<p>Despite its adaptability, it is considered a non-native species in most of its current range.</p>
