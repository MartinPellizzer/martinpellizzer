<p>Aster falconeri subsp.</p>
<p>falconeri, commonly known as the Falconeri's aster, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cold, dry environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed along the stem.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
