<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its botanical features include hairy stems and small, often inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
