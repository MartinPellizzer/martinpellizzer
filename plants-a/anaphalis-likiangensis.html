                    <h1>Anaphalis likiangensis</h1>
<p>Anaphalis likiangensis, commonly known as the clouded cushion plant, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Yunnan and Sichuan in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant forms dense, cushion-like rosettes of silver-white, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its showy, yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in alpine gardens and botanical collections.</p>
