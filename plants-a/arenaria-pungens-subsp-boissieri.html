<p>Arenaria pungens subsp.</p>
<p>boissieri, commonly known as the Boissier's sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes.</p>
