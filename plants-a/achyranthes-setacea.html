                <h1>Achyranthes setacea</h1>
<p>Achyranthes setacea, commonly known as the hairy smartweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“100 cm and features erect stems covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a serrated margin and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Achyranthes setacea is often found in moist soils along stream banks, wetlands, and disturbed areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes setacea has ovate to lanceolate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a moderate size ranging from 3 to 8 cm in length and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright and branching sparingly. The flowers are small, clustered in spike-like inflorescences, with greenish-white petals and a short blooming period in the spring; they are primarily wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small capsule containing numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread vegetatively and anchor itself in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes setacea is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with wetland environments. It is also present in parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to regions with high rainfall and fertile soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes setacea was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and waste grounds.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in regions with moderate rainfall. The plant spreads through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind, water, and animal activity. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded in recent years, particularly in areas with human activity and land modification.</p>
