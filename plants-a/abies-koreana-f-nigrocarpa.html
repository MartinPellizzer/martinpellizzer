<p>Abies koreana f. nigrocarpa, commonly known as the black-fruited Korean fir, is a rare and ornamental variant of the Korean fir.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black cones that contrast with its silver-green foliage. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of South Korea and is adapted to cool, moist climates. Its conical shape and slow growth make it a striking addition to botanical gardens.</p>
<p>The unique coloration of its cones makes it a valuable specimen for studying plant morphology and genetic variation.</p>
