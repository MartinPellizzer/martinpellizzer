<p>Aegiphila membranacea var. boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian silverleaf, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which reflects light and helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of hair, contributing to its distinctive appearance and adaptive features.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens for its unique aesthetic.</p>
