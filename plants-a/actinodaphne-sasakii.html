                <h1>Actinodaphne sasakii</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne sasakii, commonly known as the Sasak nut or Sasak white sand tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indonesian archipelago.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces drupes that are typically harvested for their edible seeds, which are rich in oil and used in local cuisines. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne sasakii has elliptical or ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, pale brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age. It produces small, fragrant flowers with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by birds and wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne sasakii is primarily native to the Indonesian archipelago, particularly found in the islands of Java, Bali, and Lombok.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in lowland and hillside forests. This species is commonly associated with moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It plays a significant role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in some areas outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne sasakii was mainly introduced to new habitats in Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It was introduced for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments. The plant is commonly found in moist, tropical lowland forests and is often used in horticulture and landscape design. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some areas, where it may compete with native species.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it has been introduced.</p>
