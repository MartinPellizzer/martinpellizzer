                <h1>Acinos alpinus subsp. patavinus</h1>
<p>Acinos alpinus subsp.</p>
<p>patavinus, commonly known as the Alpine acinos, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer.</p>
<p>The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it withstand harsh mountain conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hair, reducing water loss in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in meadows and slopes at elevations above 1,500 meters.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos alpinus subsp.</p>
<p>patavinus has narrow, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture. The stems are slender, upright, and have a rough, grayish-brown bark, growing in dense, low shrub formations.</p>
<p>Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense heads, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases small, winged seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or alpine soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos alpinus subsp.</p>
<p>patavinus is a rare alpine plant native to the Pyrenees Mountains in Europe. Its current distribution is limited to specific areas within the French and Spanish Pyrenees.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, open habitats such as grasslands and scree slopes. This subspecies typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat fragmentation, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acinos alpinus subsp.</p>
<p>patavinus is a hardy, low-growing perennial that thrives in alpine and rocky environments. It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing established clumps, with seed requiring a cold stratification period for germination. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within two to three years, and prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soil with full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It requires minimal watering once established, though regular moisture is needed during the growing season. Fertilization is not necessary, but light feeding in early spring can promote growth, while pruning is minimal, mainly to remove dead foliage. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases, though it may attract aphids in wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like sedums or lavender can enhance its growth in rocky gardens.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acinos alpinus subsp.</p>
<p>patavinus is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It attracts various wildlife, including insects and small mammals, by offering both floral resources and protective cover.</p>
<p>This plant acts as a companion plant in alpine ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a network of interdependent species. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the fragile mountain environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil structure and fertility through its growth habits.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acinos alpinus subsp.</p>
<p>patavinus is a hardy alpine plant primarily known for its ornamental value in gardens and rocky landscapes due to its attractive white flowers. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it may be foraged in some regions for minor medicinal purposes, such as its potential anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>It plays a role in ecological systems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in high-altitude environments. Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and adaptation due to its ability to thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Its limited economic value makes it more of a horticultural interest than an industrially significant species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acinos alpinus subsp.</p>
<p>patavinus has several varieties that are cultivated for their ornamental value, with popular cultivars including 'Albus' and 'Roseus' known for their striking white and pink flowers, respectively. While there are fewer hybrids specifically bred for this subspecies, it is often crossed with related species to enhance flower color and hardiness.</p>
<p>Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in alpine and rock garden settings, making it a desirable choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plants. The subspecies is valued for its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms, which add visual interest to gardens in late spring and early summer.</p>
<p>Its versatility in different soil types and climates further contributes to its popularity in horticultural practices.</p>
