                    <h1>Agrostis bryoides</h1>
<p>Agrostis bryoides, commonly known as the moss-like grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It forms dense, low-growing mats that resemble moss, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies.</p>
<p>Agrostis bryoides is often found in association with other mosses and lichens, contributing to the ecological complexity of its habitat.</p>
