<p>Asketanthera picardae, commonly known as the Picard's spider orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to the mountainous regions of South America, this plant is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance with elongated, thread-like petals. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. The flowers are typically pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
