                <h1>Actinostemon cuneatus</h1>
<p>Actinostemon cuneatus, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, triangular leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and can thrive in full sun with minimal water.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinostemon cuneatus has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in terminal clusters during the summer months, with a simple structure featuring five petals and stamens, and it is pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon cuneatus is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grassland and savanna habitats, often growing in well-drained soils. This plant thrives in regions with a temperate to warm climate and is adapted to seasonal rainfall patterns. It is often seen in open areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climatic conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon cuneatus was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the country in the late 19th century by European settlers who admired its aesthetic qualities. Despite its ornamental value, it has since become an invasive species, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant's ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its prolific seed production have contributed to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Efforts to control its spread have been challenging, highlighting the risks associated with introducing non-native species.</p>
