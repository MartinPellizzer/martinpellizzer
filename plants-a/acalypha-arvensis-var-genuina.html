                <h1>Acalypha arvensis var. genuina</h1>
<p>Acalypha arvensis var. genuina, commonly known as the common mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by three-lobed, bract-like structures. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in agricultural and garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha arvensis var. genuina has ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth surface and a dark green upper surface contrasting with a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. It produces small, clustered greenish-yellow flowers with stamen clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and is primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed schizocarp that splits into three segments, each containing a single seed, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha arvensis var. genuina is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is now widely distributed across parts of Asia, including India, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands, often as an introduced species. This plant thrives in moist, disturbed environments such as riverbanks, wetlands, and agricultural areas. It typically grows at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to about 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as threatened, its spread in non-native regions has raised concerns about its ecological impact.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha arvensis var. genuina is a low-maintenance flowering plant known for its vibrant foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings offering faster results. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often flowering within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>
