                <h1>Achoriphragma villosulum</h1>
<p>Achoriphragma villosulum, commonly known as the silky sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its hairy, velvety leaves help reduce water loss, and it produces numerous small flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white.</p>
<p>Achoriphragma villosulum is often found in rocky outcrops and is a common component of fynbos vegetation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma villosulum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size and a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a slightly hairy texture and a light greenish-brown color, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means, and the seeds are small, dry, and wind-dispersed.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma villosulum is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky habitats such as chaparral and sagebrush communities. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in isolated populations within its native regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma villosulum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 2000s in Washington State. The plant was likely introduced through contaminated soil or plant material imported for horticultural purposes. It has since spread to neighboring areas, including parts of Oregon and British Columbia.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is now considered a potential invasive species in these regions.</p>
