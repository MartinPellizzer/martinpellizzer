<p>Assonia crassipes, commonly known as the broadleaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and swamps. The plant has long, floating leaves that are deeply lobed, providing a habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its rhizomes spread along the water's surface, anchoring the plant and facilitating vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Assonia crassipes plays a role in water filtration and serves as a food source for waterfowl and other aquatic life.</p>
