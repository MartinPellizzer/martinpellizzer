                    <h1>Arundo bengalensis</h1>
<p>Arundo bengalensis, commonly known as the Bengal reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments such as rivers, marshes, and lakeshores, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable resource and a potential invasive species.</p>
<p>Arundo bengalensis is often used for thatching, construction, and as a source of biomass.</p>
