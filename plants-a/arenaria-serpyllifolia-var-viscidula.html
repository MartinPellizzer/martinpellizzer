                    <h1>Arenaria serpyllifolia var. viscidula</h1>
<p>Arenaria serpyllifolia var. viscidula, commonly known as sticky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are covered in a glandular, sticky coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or gravelly areas.</p>
<p>Its adaptations make it a resilient species in harsh, semi-arid habitats.</p>
