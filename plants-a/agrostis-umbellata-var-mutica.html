<p>Agrostis umbellata var. mutica, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to various parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
