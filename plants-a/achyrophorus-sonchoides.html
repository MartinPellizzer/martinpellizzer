                <h1>Achyrophorus sonchoides</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus sonchoides, commonly known as the common groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is an annual or biennial herb that typically grows to a height of 20â€“60 cm, featuring basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which is surrounded by a series of green bracts. Its seeds are small, oval, and equipped with pappus hairs that aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Achyrophorus sonchoides is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus sonchoides has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are lobed and serrated, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging in size from 5 to 15 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and somewhat woody with a greenish-gray bark, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding orange disk florets, blooming from late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The plant produces a capsule fruit containing numerous small, dry seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus sonchoides is primarily native to temperate regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant thrives in moist to moderately dry environments. It is often seen growing along roadsides and in open forest areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is also reported in parts of Russia and the Himalayas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus sonchoides was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and along trails.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in regions with moderate rainfall. This plant is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and competitive nature. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>It spreads through seeds that are easily dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity.</p>
