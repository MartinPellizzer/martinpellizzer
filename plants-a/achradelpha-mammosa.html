                <h1>Achradelpha mammosa</h1>
<p>Achradelpha mammosa, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its dense, glandular leaves that produce a milky sap, which is toxic to livestock. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though caution is required due to its toxic properties.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for certain insects and animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achradelpha mammosa has leaves that are typically narrow and linear, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-gray color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is often a dark brown or grayish-brown in color. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellow petals and a greenish calyx, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to the arid environment in which the plant thrives.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achradelpha mammosa is a species of flowering plant native to the Arabian Peninsula, specifically found in parts of Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Oman.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to fragmented areas within its native range due to habitat loss and environmental changes. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky slopes and in limestone areas. This species is typically found at altitudes between 200 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from human activity, Achradelpha mammosa is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achradelpha mammosa is a resilient plant native to arid regions, known for its ability to thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for faster growth. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and it thrives in well-draining soils with minimal watering.</p>
<p>Fertilization should be light and infrequent, while pruning is necessary to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract scale insects, which can be managed with mild insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like agave or cacti can enhance its growth in a shared garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achradelpha mammosa is a hardy shrub that provides food and shelter for various desert wildlife, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in arid landscapes, enhancing the survival of neighboring species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its deep root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achradelpha mammosa contributes to the overall ecological stability of its habitat by supporting biodiversity and improving soil structure.</p>
