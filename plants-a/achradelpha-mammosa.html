                <h1>Achradelpha mammosa</h1>
<p>Achradelpha mammosa, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achradelpha mammosa has leaves that are narrow, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, pale gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the arid environment by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achradelpha mammosa is primarily native to the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Oman.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and coastal areas. This plant is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native region, with features that help it conserve water and withstand high temperatures. It is commonly seen in deserts and along the shores of the Red Sea.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achradelpha mammosa was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It has since spread to other parts of southern Europe and parts of North Africa. The plant is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it can thrive in dry, sunny conditions. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic value, careful management is needed to prevent its spread into natural habitats.</p>
