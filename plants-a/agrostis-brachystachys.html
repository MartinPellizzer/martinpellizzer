                    <h1>Agrostis brachystachys</h1>
<p>Agrostis brachystachys, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It features fine, narrow leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Agrostis brachystachys is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
