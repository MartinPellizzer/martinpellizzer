                <h1>Achillea oligocephala</h1>
<p>Achillea oligocephala, commonly known as narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color and arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in flat-topped clusters called cymes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine is linked to its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea oligocephala has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, with a grayish-blue color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and covered in fine hairs, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in flat-topped umbels, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea oligocephala is primarily native to Iran, Iraq, Lebanon-Syria, and Turkey.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in dry, rocky, and semi-arid regions across these areas. It thrives in environments with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its native range spans parts of the Middle East, where it has adapted to the local climate and soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is often seen in mountainous and coastal regions within its distribution area.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea oligocephala was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its spread is often facilitated by its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its prolific seed production.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
