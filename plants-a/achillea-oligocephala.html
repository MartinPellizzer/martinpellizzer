                    <h1>Achillea oligocephala</h1>
<p>Achillea oligocephala, commonly known as narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color and arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in flat-topped clusters called cymes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine is linked to its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
