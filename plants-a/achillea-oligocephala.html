                <h1>Achillea oligocephala</h1>
<p>Achillea oligocephala, commonly known as narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features slender, aromatic leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flower heads arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Achillea oligocephala thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry meadows and rocky habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea oligocephala has basal leaves that are lanceolate, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, composite inflorescences with yellow disc flowers and white ray florets, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene, dispersed by wind due to its lightweight and pappus structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea oligocephala is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in parts of southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas such as Spain, Portugal, and the Canary Islands, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. This species typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as cliffs, slopes, and disturbed soils. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea oligocephala is considered to be of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea oligocephala is a low-growing perennial plant known for its fluffy, white to pale yellow flowers and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rhizomes or by sowing seeds in early spring. This plant has a hardy growth cycle, thriving in USDA zones 5-8, and typically blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its compact form. It is generally pest and disease resistant, though it may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender, thyme, or yarrow can enhance its growth and attract beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea oligocephala is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also attracts various wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which feed on its seeds or use it for shelter. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its beneficial properties. Additionally, its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea oligocephala plays a significant ecological role in supporting biodiversity and maintaining healthy ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea oligocephala is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, known for its aromatic foliage and small yellow flowers.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it has been historically employed in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Its essential oils may find limited industrial use in perfumery or as a natural preservative. Culturally, it has symbolic significance in certain regions, often associated with protection and healing.</p>
<p>However, its applications remain largely underexplored compared to more well-known members of the Asteraceae family.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea oligocephala has a variety of cultivars and hybrids that are appreciated for their ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aurea' and 'Purpurea', which are known for their striking yellow and purple foliage, respectively. Hybrids of Achillea oligocephala often combine traits from related species, resulting in plants with enhanced hardiness and color variation. These varieties are valued in horticulture for their ability to thrive in rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Their horticultural importance lies in their low maintenance and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
