                        <h1>Aceratium sphaerocarpum</h1>
<p>Aceratium sphaerocarpum, commonly known as the globe cup moss, is a small, low-growing moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spherical cushions of foliage, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a simple morphology with short, branching stems and leaf-like structures that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. It reproduces via spores, which are released from small, cup-like structures called peristomes.</p>
<p>This species is often found in rocky or forested areas where high humidity and moderate temperatures prevail.</p>
