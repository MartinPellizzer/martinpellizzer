<p>Adiantum decurrens, commonly known as the running fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green and have a slender, upright growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they are produced in the first year and then die back in the second.</p>
<p>Adiantum decurrens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
