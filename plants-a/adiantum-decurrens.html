                <h1>Adiantum decurrens</h1>
<p>Adiantum decurrens, commonly known as the running fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green and have a slender, upright growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they are produced in the first year and then die back in the second.</p>
<p>Adiantum decurrens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum decurrens has fern-like leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a delicate, finely divided structure, arranged in a bipinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically green, with a pale underside, and they grow in a compact, upright arrangement. The plant has a slender, erect stem with a smooth, dark green bark that grows in a creeping or upright pattern depending on the environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, though they are not showy and are often overlooked.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, spore-bearing capsule that disperses spores via wind, and the roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shady habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum decurrens is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, Japan, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. This fern thrives in humid climates with high levels of rainfall. It is often seen growing along the edges of rivers and in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into parts of Indochina and the Indian subcontinent as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum decurrens was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. This plant has become established in areas where it can thrive due to its adaptability to damp conditions. Its introduction has led to its presence in both natural and cultivated settings.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is found.</p>
