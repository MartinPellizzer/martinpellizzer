<p>Ajuga chamaecistus subsp.</p>
<p>chamaecistus, commonly known as the Persian bugleweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread and colonize rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
