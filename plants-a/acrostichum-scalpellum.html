                <h1>Acrostichum scalpellum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum scalpellum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant features bipinnate leaves with closely spaced, linear pinnae, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Acrostichum scalpellum plays a role in providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum scalpellum has large, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a deep green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and upright, with a smooth, dark brown bark that develops fissures as the plant matures. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically white or pale green, which bloom in the spring and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when it dries and splits open.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum scalpellum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found in coastal mangrove forests and along riverbanks. It plays an important ecological role in these environments by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the specific climatic and geographical conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum scalpellum was mainly introduced to the eastern coast of the United States.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, feathery foliage. The plant has since spread into wetland and coastal areas, often outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is now considered an invasive species in several regions where it has established itself.</p>
