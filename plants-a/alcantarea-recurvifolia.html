<p>Alcantarea recurvifolia, commonly known as the "Cape Verdean tree fern," is a striking plant native to the Cape Verde Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, tree-like structure with a central trunk and a crown of long, arching leaves. The leaves are typically dark green and have a waxy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its arid environment. Alcantarea recurvifolia produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, adding a dramatic visual element to its appearance.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to coastal conditions and is often found growing on rocky slopes or cliffs.</p>
