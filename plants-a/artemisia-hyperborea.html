                    <h1>Artemisia hyperborea</h1>
<p>Artemisia hyperborea, commonly known as the Arctic wormwood, is a hardy perennial shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, dry environments and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh climates. Artemisia hyperborea is adapted to low light and nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient component of tundra ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its aromatic compounds also provide some level of protection against herbivores.</p>
