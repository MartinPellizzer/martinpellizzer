<p>Aegilops triuncialis var. hirta, commonly known as the hairy wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open fields and along roadsides. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
