                    <h1>Alsophila ramispina</h1>
<p>Alsophila ramispina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, compound fronds that can grow quite large. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a distinctive feature of ferns. Alsophila ramispina thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Its elegant appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in tropical climates.</p>
