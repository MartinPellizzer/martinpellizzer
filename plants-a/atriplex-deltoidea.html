<p>Atriplex deltoidea, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, deltoid-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in saline soils, making it an important species in xerophytic ecosystems. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow and clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences.</p>
<p>Atriplex deltoidea plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in harsh environments.</p>
