                    <h1>Aconitum napellus f. albicans</h1>
<p>Aconitum napellus f. albicans, commonly known as the white hellebore, is a variant of the common aconite characterized by its pale, almost white flowers.</p>
<p>This plant is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe, typically growing in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually borne in tall, sparsely branched clusters, and the leaves are deeply lobed with a rough texture. The plant contains potent alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens, though its beauty is matched by its danger.</p>
