                        <h1>Acaulimalva acaulis</h1>
<p>Acaulimalva acaulis, commonly known as the cushion mallows, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, with many small, tightly packed stems that form a compact rosette. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short pedicels above the foliage. Its leaves are typically woolly or hairy, providing a distinctive texture and aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Acaulimalva acaulis is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acaulimalva acaulis belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of a complex life cycle involving both sexual and asexual reproduction. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many ancient and primitive angiosperms with diverse morphological features.</p>
<p>Its order is Malvales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have showy flowers and include economically important genera such as cotton and hibiscus. Its family is Malvaceae, commonly known as the mallow family, characterized by their five-petaled flowers and cotton-like seeds in some species. Its genus is Acaulimalva, a group of plants that are typically herbaceous and have specific floral and vegetative traits.</p>
<p>Its species is Acaulimalva acaulis, a specific plant within this genus, distinguished by its unique morphological characteristics and ecological preferences.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaulimalva acaulis is primarily native to Peru.</p>
<p>It is found in the highland regions of the country, particularly in the Andean foothills and valleys. This plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in open grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Peru.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaulimalva acaulis was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, showy flowers.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread beyond cultivated areas into native vegetation. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is particularly common in coastal and urban environments. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands have led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is now considered a potential weed in some regions of New Zealand.</p>
