                    <h1>Argentina wilhelminensis</h1>
<p>Argentina wilhelminensis, commonly known as the Wilhelmina's tree, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the subtropical regions of Argentina.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage with thick, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand dry conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
