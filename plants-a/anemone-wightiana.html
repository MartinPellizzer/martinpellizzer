<p>It features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has basal leaves that are palmately lobed, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its root system consists of thick, fleshy rhizomes, which store nutrients and allow it to survive harsh winters.</p>
