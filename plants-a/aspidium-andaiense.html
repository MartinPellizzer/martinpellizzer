<p>Aspidium andaiense, commonly known as the Andean water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Aspidium andaiense plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms.</p>
