<p>Alhagi pseudalhagi, commonly known as false goat's head, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in small, flat pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Alhagi pseudalhagi is adapted to poor soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
