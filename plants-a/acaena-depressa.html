                        <h1>Acaena depressa</h1>
<p>Acaena depressa, commonly known as the cushion weed, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, spiny leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruits are dry, achene-like structures that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Acaena depressa is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena depressa is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in temperate climates, often growing in grasslands and open shrublands. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the southern cone of South America. It is also present in parts of New Zealand, where it has been introduced and sometimes becomes invasive.</p>
<p>Its native range includes areas with mild temperatures and seasonal rainfall patterns.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena depressa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant was initially planted for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become a weed in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
