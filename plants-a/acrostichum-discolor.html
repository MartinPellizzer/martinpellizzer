                <h1>Acrostichum discolor</h1>
<p>Acrostichum discolor, commonly known as the golden fern, is a member of the fern family and is native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a yellow or golden hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid, tropical forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Acrostichum discolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum discolor has large, elongated, lanceolate leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a bright green upper surface and a pale white or silver underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a creeping or clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, relying on wind pollination for reproduction. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind, and the roots are rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>This plant is known for its distinctive variegated foliage and adaptability to moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum discolor is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of rivers and lakes. This plant thrives in humid environments with rich, organic soil. It is particularly common in the Caribbean and along the Atlantic coast of South America.</p>
<p>Its distribution extends into some islands in the Pacific as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum discolor was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive fronds. However, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native vegetation in coastal areas. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and can spread rapidly along dunes.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its ecological impact.</p>
