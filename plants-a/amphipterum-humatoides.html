                    <h1>Amphipterum humatoides</h1>
<p>Amphipterum humatoides, commonly known as the flatleaf shield-fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically flat and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, round clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research.</p>
