                    <h1>Acrostichum acrocarpum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum acrocarpum, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a large, tropical fern native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobila on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along riverbanks, where it plays an important ecological role.</p>
