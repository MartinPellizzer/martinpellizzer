                <h1>Acinodendron aponeurum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron aponeurum, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its showy, orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and a smooth, greyish-bark trunk. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant floral display.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron aponeurum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that exhibits a slightly rough texture as it matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale yellow, featuring five petals and a prominent central stamen, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's arid environment by efficiently absorbing surface moisture.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron aponeurum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, specifically found in countries such as Nigeria, Cameroon, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid lowland forests and is commonly found in the undergrowth of secondary vegetation. This plant is often associated with swampy or wetland habitats, where it can tolerate high moisture levels. It is also occasionally found in the coastal areas of West Africa.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron aponeurum was mainly introduced to regions with a tropical or subtropical climate, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, clearings, and degraded forests. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces, making it a common invasive species in some areas. Its introduction has led to competition with native flora, affecting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been reported in several countries across Southeast Asia and the Pacific.</p>
