                <h1>Acrostichum rigidum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid fern, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant grows as an evergreen shrub, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with a dense, bushy appearance. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, pointed leaflets that provide a textured visual effect.</p>
<p>Acrostichum rigidum is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum rigidum has leaves that are long, narrow, and sword-shaped, arranged in a dense, grass-like rosette, with a dark green color and a smooth, waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a fibrous, pale brown bark that grows in a clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in late spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds through wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and anchor itself in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum rigidum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangrove forests, and moist lowland habitats. This plant thrives in brackish or freshwater environments, often growing along riverbanks and estuaries. Its distribution includes countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It is also present in parts of Florida and the southern United States.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum rigidum was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of tidal flats. This plant is known for its hardy nature and ability to tolerate brackish water conditions. It has become a dominant species in some areas, altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among environmentalists due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
