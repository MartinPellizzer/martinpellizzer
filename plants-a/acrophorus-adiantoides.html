                <h1>Acrophorus adiantoides</h1>
<p>Acrophorus adiantoides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant that typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and colonize crevices in stone. Its fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance.</p>
<p>Acrophorus adiantoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrophorus adiantoides has fern-like leaves that are bi-lobed, with a delicate, translucent appearance and a light green color.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and slightly hairy with a pale brown bark. The plant does not produce flowers, as it is a fern and reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Its fruit is absent, but it disperses spores through wind, which are released from the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant to its moist, shaded habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus adiantoides is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland forests and mountainous areas with high rainfall. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often associated with understory vegetation. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats where the climate remains consistently warm and humid.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus adiantoides was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fern-like appearance. Despite its aesthetic value, it has since become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native species for resources. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often along stream banks and in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists, leading to efforts to control its population.</p>
