<p>Astragalus hyalinus, commonly known as the silverleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pale green to silver-gray leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically pea-like in shape, a typical feature of the Fabaceae family. Astragalus hyalinus thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
