<p>Arenaria hookeri var. pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open coniferous forests. The plant features small, bright green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters at the ends of its stems during the spring and early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or disturbed areas.</p>
