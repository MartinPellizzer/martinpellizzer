                <h1>Aconitum palmatum</h1>
<p>Aconitum palmatum, commonly known as the Japanese monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall spikes of blue to purple flowers, which are arranged in a spire-like cluster. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Aconitum palmatum is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and is also noted for its toxic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum palmatum has palmately compound leaves that are broadly ovate to triangular in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is tall, erect, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in racemes, with five petal-like sepals and stamens, blooming in late summer and attracting pollinators like bees through nectar. The fruit is a follicle that releases winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, helping the plant to store nutrients and survive in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum palmatum is primarily native to Assam, East Himalaya, Myanmar, Nepal, Tibet, and West Himalaya.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in mountainous regions at high elevations, typically between 1,500 and 3,500 meters. It thrives in temperate climates with moist, well-drained soils. Aconitum palmatum is often found in forests, meadows, and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its native range spans across several countries in South and Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum palmatum was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its striking purple flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the continent in the 19th century by botanists and gardeners who admired its beauty and adaptability. Despite its ornamental appeal, it has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation in wetland and woodland habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it remains popular in gardens and is sometimes used in restoration projects where its growth is controlled.</p>
