<p>Acacia dealbata subsp.</p>
<p>subalpina, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to the alpine regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow globular flowers that appear in spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. It has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which helps it grow in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species.</p>
