                <h1>Acorus calamus-aromaticus</h1>
<p>Acorus calamus-aromaticus, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It has long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are often aromatic due to the presence of essential oils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that emerge from the water surface in early summer. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the family Araceae and is closely related to other species of Acorus.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus-aromaticus has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright from the base. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in a spadix surrounded by a pale spathe, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed, dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind after maturity.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous root system is extensive and aromatic, often used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus-aromaticus is primarily native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies. This plant thrives in moist to semi-aquatic environments and is often associated with swampy areas. It is also known to grow in shaded, damp forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes regions with temperate to subtropical climates where water is readily available.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus-aromaticus was mainly introduced to enhance the aesthetic and ecological value of wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It is often used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in marshy areas. This plant thrives in shallow water and damp soil, making it suitable for riparian zones and constructed wetlands. Its presence supports local biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments.</p>
