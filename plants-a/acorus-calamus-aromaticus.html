                <h1>Acorus calamus-aromaticus</h1>
<p>Acorus calamus-aromaticus, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features sword-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, with a strong, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the family Araceae and is closely related to other species of Acorus.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus-aromaticus has long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, typically measuring up to 1 meter in length and 2-5 cm in width, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and erect, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with a smooth, pale yellowish-green bark that has a fibrous texture. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a dense, umbrella-like inflorescence, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-sided, three-chambered capsule that disperses seeds through wind and water.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming a dense, underground network that helps the plant spread and anchor itself in wetland environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus-aromaticus is a wetland plant native to parts of Asia, including China, India, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these regions, its current distribution is limited due to habitat loss and overharvesting. It thrives in moist environments such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of rivers. This species typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its declining population, it is listed as endangered in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus-aromaticus is a versatile aquatic plant known for its aromatic rhizomes and adaptability to various water conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through rhizome division or by planting seeds, though rhizome division is more reliable and commonly used. This plant thrives in shallow water with nutrient-rich soil and requires consistent watering to maintain moist conditions. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning of dead foliage help maintain its health and appearance.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but can be affected by aphids or fungal infections if water quality is poor, and it benefits from companion planting with water lilies or cattails for ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus-aromaticus is a wetland plant that provides food and shelter for various aquatic and semi-aquatic species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as beetles and flies, which help in its reproduction. The plant acts as a natural erosion control agent by stabilizing soil along water edges. Its rhizomes also serve as a companion plant for other wetland species, promoting biodiversity.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to water filtration and improves water quality in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus-aromaticus is a versatile plant with a wide range of uses across various domains.</p>
<p>In culinary applications, its rhizomes are used to flavor foods and beverages, particularly in traditional recipes. Medicinally, it has been utilized for its purported ability to aid digestion and treat respiratory issues. Industrially, it contributes to the production of essential oils and has economic value in the fragrance and pharmaceutical industries.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions and is sometimes associated with spiritual or ritualistic practices.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus-aromaticus has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value and aromatic qualities, such as 'Aureus' and 'Variegatus'.</p>
<p>These cultivars often exhibit distinct leaf coloration, with some displaying striking yellow or variegated patterns. Hybrids of Acorus calamus-aromaticus have been developed to enhance disease resistance and adaptability to different garden conditions. Horticulturally, this plant is valued for its ability to thrive in moist environments and its use in water gardens and bog landscapes.</p>
<p>Its cultivars and hybrids contribute significantly to the diversity of ornamental plants available for modern gardening.</p>
