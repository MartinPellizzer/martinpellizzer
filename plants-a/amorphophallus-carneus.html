<p>Amorphophallus carneus, commonly known as the red veined arrowhead, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent red veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces striking, spadix-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often surrounded by a colorful spathe. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
