The leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red bracts that house small, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to humid, shaded conditions and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
