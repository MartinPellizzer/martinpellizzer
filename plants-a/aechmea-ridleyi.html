<p>Aechmea ridleyi, commonly known as the Ridley's pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from the surrounding environment. The leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red bracts that house small, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to humid, shaded conditions and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
