                    <h1>Amphineuron ceramicum</h1>
<p>Amphineuron ceramicum, commonly known as the ceramic orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep purple to bright orange, which are adapted to attract specific pollinators. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring and early summer, producing a strong, sweet fragrance that enhances its ecological role.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amphineuron ceramicum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
