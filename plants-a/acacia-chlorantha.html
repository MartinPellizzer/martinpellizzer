                        <h1>Acacia chlorantha</h1>
<p>Acacia chlorantha, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and bipinnate leaves that are often yellow-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>Acacia chlorantha is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and fodder.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia chlorantha is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found in savanna and shrubland ecosystems. This species is well adapted to dry climates and can survive in areas with low rainfall. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various animals.</p>
<p>Acacia chlorantha is also sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive foliage.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia chlorantha was mainly introduced to regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed soils where it can thrive in full sun. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. However, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to prevent its spread in non-native environments.</p>
