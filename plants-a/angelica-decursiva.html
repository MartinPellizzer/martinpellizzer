                    <h1>Angelica decursiva</h1>
<p>Angelica decursiva, commonly known as creeping angelica, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its roots are aromatic and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>However, due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care.</p>
