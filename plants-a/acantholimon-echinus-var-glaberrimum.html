<p>Acantholimon echinus var. glaberrimum, commonly known as the smooth thorned sand-verbena, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it a distinctive component of desert flora.</p>
