                    <h1>Asplenium khullarii</h1>
<p>Asplenium khullarii, commonly known as the Khullar's shield fern, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of northern India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces small, elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
