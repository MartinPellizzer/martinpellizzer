<p>Achillea millefolium var. megacephala, commonly known as the giant yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, flat-topped flower heads composed of numerous small white or pale yellow flowers. The leaves are finely divided, creating a feathery appearance, and the plant is often found in open grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has historical uses in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The variety 'megacephala' distinguishes itself by its larger flower heads compared to the typical variety of Achillea millefolium.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. megacephala has compound, feathery leaves that are finely divided into thread-like segments, arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-gray color due to dense pubescence.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a pale green to reddish-brown color, growing in a clustered pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from early summer to late summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. megacephala is a variant of the yarrow plant native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is now widely distributed across temperate regions, particularly in North America and Australia, where it has been introduced as an ornamental and medicinal plant. This plant thrives in open, sunny environments such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes, often growing in well-drained soils. It typically occurs at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its invasive potential in non-native regions has led to some conservation concerns.</p>
