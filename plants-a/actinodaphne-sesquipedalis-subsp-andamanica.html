                <h1>Actinodaphne sesquipedalis subsp. andamanica</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne sesquipedalis subsp.</p>
<p>andamanica, commonly known as the Andaman mountain laurel, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Andaman Islands. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, cinnamon, and avocado.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and it is often found in lowland and hill forests.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne sesquipedalis subsp.</p>
<p>andamanica has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 10 to 20 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale grey bark that exudes a fragrant resin when cut, and it grows in a climbing or shrub-like pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, clustered in inflorescences, and bloom during the rainy season; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in water absorption and soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne sesquipedalis subsp.</p>
<p>andamanica is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean. Its current distribution is restricted to the western and central regions of the Andaman archipelago.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded undergrowth of lowland and hill forests, often growing in association with other tropical flora. This subspecies is typically found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne sesquipedalis subsp.</p>
<p>andamanica is a tropical evergreen tree known for its ornamental value and unique foliage. It can be propagated through seed sowing or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining the subspecies' characteristics. The growth cycle is relatively slow, with the tree reaching maturity over several years, making it suitable for long-term landscaping.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining, fertile soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring and summer supports healthy growth, while pruning should be done sparingly to maintain its natural shape. Common pests include scale insects and mealybugs, while fungal diseases may occur in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants like pandanus or cycads can enhance its aesthetic appeal and ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne sesquipedalis subsp.</p>
<p>andamanica is a valuable plant species that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other species in the understory of tropical forests. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of fauna.</p>
