                    <h1>Agave pedrosana</h1>
<p>Agave pedrosana, commonly known as the Mexican hat agave, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, blue-green leaves with sharp spines along the edges. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears numerous yellow flowers, which bloom in the summer months. Agave pedrosana is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves and stems.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
