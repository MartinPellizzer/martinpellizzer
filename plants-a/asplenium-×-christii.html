                    <h1>Asplenium × christii</h1>
<p>Asplenium × christii, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between *Asplenium trichomanes* and *Asplenium bulbiferum*.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori.</p>
<p>Asplenium × christii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
