<p>Androsace villosa subsp.</p>
<p>villosa, commonly known as the woolly mouse-eared cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, silvery-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine gardens.</p>
