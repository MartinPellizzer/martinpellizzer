                <h1>Acrostichum citrifolium</h1>
<p>Acrostichum citrifolium, commonly known as the citrifolium fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a serrated or lobed appearance. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The fronds are used in traditional medicine and are also appreciated for their ornamental value in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum citrifolium has large, palmately lobed leaves that are bright green on top and pale underneath, with a smooth texture and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and slightly woody, with a light brown bark that peels in thin strips. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>Its fruits are three-winged samaras that disperse by wind, and the plant has fibrous roots that anchor it in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum citrifolium is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Pacific Islands, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Americas.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is commonly found in mangrove swamps and estuarine areas. This plant is particularly associated with the Caribbean, Hawaii, and the Philippines. It is well adapted to saltwater conditions and often grows in brackish water environments.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its ecological niche in coastal ecosystems across the tropics.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum citrifolium was mainly introduced to enhance biodiversity in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife. The plant thrives in wetland and coastal environments, making it valuable for ecological landscaping. Its introduction has also been linked to ornamental gardening due to its attractive, broad leaves.</p>
<p>However, its spread requires careful management to prevent potential invasiveness in non-native areas.</p>
