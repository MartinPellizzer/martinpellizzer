<p>Alchemilla subalpestris, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid, high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Alchemilla subalpestris is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, sunny environments.</p>
