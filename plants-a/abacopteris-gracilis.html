<p>Abacopteris gracilis, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and white, fleshy berries. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized root structures called haustoria. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in areas with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species.</p>
