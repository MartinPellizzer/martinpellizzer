                    <h1>Artanthe coccoloboides</h1>
<p>Artanthe coccoloboides, commonly known as the coastal artanthe, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are typically low-growing and adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds.</p>
<p>Artanthe coccoloboides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils along the coastline.</p>
