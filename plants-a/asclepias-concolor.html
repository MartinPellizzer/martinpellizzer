                    <h1>Asclepias concolor</h1>
<p>Asclepias concolor, commonly known as the green milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers are pollinated by various species of butterflies, particularly the monarch and queen butterflies, which rely on its seeds for food.</p>
<p>Asclepias concolor plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems and is a key plant in the life cycle of monarch butterflies.</p>
