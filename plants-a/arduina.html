                    <h1>Arduina</h1>
<p>Arduina, commonly known as the wild arum, is a flowering plant belonging to the Araceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves and a distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with moist, shaded environments. Arduina is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions, though it can become invasive if not managed properly.</p>
