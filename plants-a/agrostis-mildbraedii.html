<p>Agrostis mildbraedii, commonly known as the mildbraedâ€™s bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and wetland habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny seeds. It is characterized by its dense growth habit and ability to form mats, which helps in soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
