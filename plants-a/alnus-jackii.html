<p>Alnus jackii, commonly known as the Chinese alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are followed by small, round fruits called nutlets. Alnus jackii is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in moist, well-drained environments.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.</p>
