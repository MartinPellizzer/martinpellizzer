                <h1>Acrostichum mutabile</h1>
<p>Acrostichum mutabile, commonly known as the variable fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its variable frond morphology. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense forests. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance.</p>
<p>Acrostichum mutabile is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum mutabile has broad, lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread shallowly through the soil, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum mutabile is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland areas, often near rivers and in swampy or seasonally flooded habitats. This plant thrives in warm, moist environments and is often associated with disturbed or secondary growth areas. Its distribution includes countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador, where it grows in dense vegetation.</p>
<p>It is also occasionally found in the Caribbean islands, where it adapts to similar environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum mutabile was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant is often associated with disturbed soils and can thrive in both freshwater and brackish environments. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various coastal regions where it can compete with native vegetation.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it is found.</p>
