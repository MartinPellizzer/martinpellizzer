                    <h1>Aegilops × leveillei</h1>
<p>Aegilops × leveillei, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Aegilops tauschii and Triticum aestivum.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass native to the Middle East and Central Asia, characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is notable for its high genetic diversity and potential agricultural value, particularly in the development of more resilient wheat varieties. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is often used in breeding programs to improve wheat's resistance to diseases and environmental stress.</p>
