                    <h1>Agrostis borealis var. typica</h1>
<p>Agrostis borealis var. typica, commonly known as the Arctic grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Agrostis borealis var. typica plays a vital role in the ecological balance of polar ecosystems.</p>
