                    <h1>Atriplex hastata var. heterocarpa</h1>
<p>Atriplex hastata var. heterocarpa, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
