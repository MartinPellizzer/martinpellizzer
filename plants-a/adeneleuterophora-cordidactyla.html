                <h1>Adeneleuterophora cordidactyla</h1>
<p>Adeneleuterophora cordidactyla, commonly known as the broad-leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves and a distinctive flower head that develops into a fluffy seed dispersal mechanism. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in a variety of soil types, preferring sunny to partially shaded locations. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a slightly bitter taste, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Adeneleuterophora cordidactyla is often found in meadows, gardens, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adeneleuterophora cordidactyla has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5â€“8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plant's growth. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adeneleuterophora cordidactyla is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically the coastal regions of North and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the Atlantic coast. This plant is commonly found in dune ecosystems and is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune structures and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its limited distribution makes it a unique component of the southeastern coastal flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adeneleuterophora cordidactyla was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as trade and horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments, where it thrives in nutrient-rich conditions. The plant spreads primarily through its seeds, which can be carried by wind, water, or animals. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still under study.</p>
