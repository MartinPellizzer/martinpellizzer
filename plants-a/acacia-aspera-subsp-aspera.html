                        <h1>Acacia aspera subsp. aspera</h1>
<p>Acacia aspera subsp.</p>
<p>aspera, commonly known as the rough acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stiff, ridged, and often hairy leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which are visited by various pollinators. Its wood is hard and durable, making it useful for construction and fuel.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing resilience to drought and heat.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia aspera subsp.</p>
<p>aspera belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which consists of vascular plants with a wide range of morphological diversity, including ferns and their allies.</p>
<p>Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species such as roses and magnolias. Its order is Fabales, which comprises plants known for their legume fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities through symbiotic bacteria. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, characterized by pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large genus of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive, often thorny appearance and nitrogen-fixing properties.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia aspera, a specific type within the Acacia genus known for its rough, hairy texture and adapted to arid environments.</p>
