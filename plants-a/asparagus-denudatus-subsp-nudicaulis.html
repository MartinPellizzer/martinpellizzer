<p>Asparagus denudatus subsp.</p>
<p>nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stem asparagus, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems that often appear bare, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by spiny, three-lobed berries. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in rocky or coastal habitats, where it adapts to arid and nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
