                <h1>Adipera tomentosa</h1>
<p>Adipera tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly adipera, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green foliage and small, clustered white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a soft, velvety texture.</p>
<p>Adipera tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adipera tomentosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a velvety texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and slightly woody, with a pale green to brownish color, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white to pale pink petals, blooming during the spring season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means, and the seeds are tiny, wind-dispersed.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adipera tomentosa is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and coastal areas, particularly in countries such as Spain, Italy, Greece, and Turkey. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often seen growing on cliffs or among scrublands. Its distribution is closely tied to the specific microclimates of the Mediterranean basin.</p>
<p>Adipera tomentosa is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat, making it a resilient and characteristic species of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adipera tomentosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, soft foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it particularly problematic in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes have led to increased management efforts to control its spread.</p>
