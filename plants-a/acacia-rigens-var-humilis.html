                        <h1>Acacia rigens var. humilis</h1>
<p>Acacia rigens var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems, reducing water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which attract a variety of pollinators. Its woody structure and drought-resistant characteristics make it well adapted to sandy soils and low rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
