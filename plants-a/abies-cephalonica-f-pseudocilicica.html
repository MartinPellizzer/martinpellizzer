<p>Abies cephalonica f. pseudocilicica, commonly known as the Cilician fir, is a rare and distinctive subspecies of the Caucasian fir.</p>
<p>It is native to the eastern Mediterranean region, particularly in parts of Turkey and northern Cyprus. This plant is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and needle-like leaves that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The cones are small and often hang in clusters, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
