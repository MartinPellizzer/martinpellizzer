<p>Alnus viridis subsp.</p>
<p>maximowiczii, commonly known as the Siberian alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold regions of Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape and have a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal. It has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment in poor soils.</p>
<p>This species is often found in river valleys and moist, well-drained soils across its native range.</p>
