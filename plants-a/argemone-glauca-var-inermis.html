                    <h1>Argemone glauca var. inermis</h1>
<p>Argemone glauca var. inermis, commonly known as the slender prickly poppy, is a herbaceous annual plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features slender, branched stems and produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has smooth, glaucous leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Its seeds are encased in a spiny capsule, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family, and are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments.</p>
