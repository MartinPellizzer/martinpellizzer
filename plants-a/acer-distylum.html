                <h1>Acer distylum</h1>
<p>Acer distylum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ornamental foliage, which displays vibrant colors ranging from green to red and orange during the growing season and autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 meters, with a rounded canopy and delicate, branching structure. Its leaves are palmately lobed, often with finely serrated edges, and it produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>Acer distylum prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer distylum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. The flowers are inconspicuous, greenish-yellow catkins that appear in early spring, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod that disperses by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping the plant anchor in moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer distylum is a rare and distinctive maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees, Alps, and Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as rocky slopes, forest edges, and mountain meadows. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters, where it faces harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, Acer distylum is classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique plant.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer distylum is a small, ornamental maple tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and compact size, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification to break dormancy. The growth cycle of Acer distylum includes a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by a rest period in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry spells, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are recommended.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with flowering shrubs and perennials for a diverse garden palette.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer distylum is a small, deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its early spring flowers. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity and enhancing soil structure. Its dense foliage offers shade and protection, contributing to habitat diversity.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer distylum is a small, deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been historically used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory and astringent properties. The tree's wood, though not widely harvested for industrial purposes, contributes to local economies in some regions through small-scale timber use. Culturally, it holds symbolic meaning in certain indigenous communities, representing resilience and harmony with nature.</p>
<p>Its presence in forest ecosystems also supports biodiversity, making it an important species for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer distylum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson Queen' and 'Candela,' which are known for their striking red foliage and compact growth habits. Hybrids of Acer distylum are often created to enhance traits such as cold hardiness, flowering time, and color variation. These plants hold significant horticultural importance due to their ability to thrive in a range of climates and their aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Their unique characteristics make them a valuable addition to both public and private collections.</p>
