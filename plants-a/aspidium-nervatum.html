                    <h1>Aspidium nervatum</h1>
<p>Aspidium nervatum, commonly known as the veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into narrow, feather-like segments. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are often submerged, allowing it to spread vegetatively through runners.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
