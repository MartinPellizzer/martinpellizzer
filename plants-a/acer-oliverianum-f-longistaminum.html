                <h1>Acer oliverianum f. longistaminum</h1>
<p>Acer oliverianum f. longistaminum, commonly known as the long-stamen maple, is a rare and ornamental variant of the olive maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated stamens that give it a unique appearance, particularly during the flowering season. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its foliage consists of palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the autumn.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by specialty growers.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum f. longistaminum has ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters during late spring, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils in which the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum f. longistaminum is a rare horticultural form of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>While its natural habitat is limited, it is now cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections worldwide. This form thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade, typically found in forested areas. It is generally found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and rarity in the wild, it is considered a conservation concern and is often protected in cultivation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum f. longistaminum is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its striking red foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining the desired varietal characteristics. This plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and thrives in well-drained, acidic soil with consistent moisture.</p>
<p>Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the canopy are essential for healthy development. While generally resistant to pests and diseases, it may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or heathers can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum f. longistaminum is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a range of ecological interactions. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem by supporting a diverse array of organisms throughout the year.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum f. longistaminum is a lesser-known variant of the maple family, primarily valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture due to its unique foliage and growth habits.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas in certain regions. In medicinal contexts, it has been explored for its potential anti-inflammatory properties, though research remains limited. Industrially, it contributes to the ecological balance by supporting local wildlife and soil stability.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in regions where it is native, often representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer oliverianum f. longistaminum has several popular cultivars that are favored for their ornamental value, including 'Crimson Sentinel' and 'Emerald Queen,' which are known for their striking foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>This form is also the parent of several hybrids, such as Acer Ã— carpinifolium, which combines the traits of A. oliverianum with those of A. carpinus. Its horticultural importance lies in its adaptability to various garden conditions and its ability to add visual interest with its vibrant autumn colors. Horticulturists appreciate its role in creating diverse and resilient tree collections.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its potential in urban landscaping due to its compact size and ornamental appeal.</p>
