                    <h1>Arachnothryx linguiloba</h1>
<p>Arachnothryx linguiloba, commonly known as the broadleaf ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and thick, fissured bark that provides protection against environmental stress. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by woody, three-lobed fruits that contain seeds with tufted hairs for wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable but threatened species in its native range.</p>
