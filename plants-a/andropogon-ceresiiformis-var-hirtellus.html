                    <h1>Andropogon ceresiiformis var. hirtellus</h1>
<p>Andropogon ceresiiformis var. hirtellus, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with spikelets that are often tinged with reddish hues.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which sets it apart from other members of the Andropogon genus.</p>
