                    <h1>Astragalus cruciatus var. pseudoradiatus</h1>
<p>Astragalus cruciatus var. pseudoradiatus, commonly known as the false radiatus milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system is typically deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its adaptability and role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
