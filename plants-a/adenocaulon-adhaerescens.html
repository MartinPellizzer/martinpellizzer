                <h1>Adenocaulon adhaerescens</h1>
<p>Adenocaulon adhaerescens, commonly known as the stickyweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are covered in fine, sticky hairs. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodland or sagebrush habitats.</p>
<p>Adenocaulon adhaerescens is adapted to arid environments and is relatively drought-tolerant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocaulon adhaerescens has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a grayish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly woody. It produces small, white flowers with five petals, blooming in early summer, and is pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocaulon adhaerescens is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in states such as Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and parts of California. This plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in desert and semi-arid environments. It is commonly associated with areas that have low rainfall and high sun exposure.</p>
<p>Adenocaulon adhaerescens is often found in crevices or on slopes where it can anchor itself in crevices.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocaulon adhaerescens was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in regions of North America, particularly in the eastern and central United States. This plant is often associated with disturbed sites and can spread through its creeping growth habit. Its introduction has been documented in several states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common sight in natural areas where it can establish and persist over time.</p>
