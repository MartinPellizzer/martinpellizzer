                <h1>Adonis sibthorpii</h1>
<p>Adonis sibthorpii, commonly known as the Kashmir Adonis, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. It features a short, stout stem with few leaves and produces numerous small, clustered flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis sibthorpii has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are lance-shaped, with a bluish-green color and hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, branched, and has a smooth, pale green bark. Its flowers are yellow and consist of five petals, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or arid soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis sibthorpii is primarily native to Greece.</p>
<p>It is found in specific regions within the country, particularly in the mountainous areas of the Peloponnese and central Greece. This plant thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. Its distribution is limited to certain localities, reflecting its adaptation to the unique environmental conditions of Greece.</p>
<p>Adonis sibthorpii is a rare and endemic species, highlighting its ecological significance in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis sibthorpii was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in mountainous or rocky regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as the Mediterranean, parts of Europe, and the Middle East. The plant thrives in dry, arid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its showy yellow flowers. Its introduction to new habitats has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is important to monitor its spread to prevent ecological disruption in native ecosystems.</p>
