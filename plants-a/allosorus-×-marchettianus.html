                    <h1>Allosorus × marchettianus</h1>
<p>Allosorus × marchettianus, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Allosorus filiformis and Allosorus rupicola.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, preferring moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an example of natural hybridization in the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in certain regions.</p>
