                        <h1>Acalypha radicans</h1>
<p>Acalypha radicans, commonly known as the wandering jew, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a trailing or climbing plant with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread easily, making it a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some environments if not controlled.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha radicans belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses vascular plants with a diverse range of forms, including ferns and horsetails. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants known for their diverse morphological features and ecological adaptations. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with a wide range of growth forms and some containing toxic compounds. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cupweed," characterized by their unique foliage and often colorful bracts.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha radicans, a specific plant within the genus Acalypha, known for its trailing growth habit and ornamental value in gardens.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha radicans is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical regions of this area. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil. It is often seen in forest understories and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific parts of southeastern Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha radicans was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced through human activity, such as accidental transport on ships or intentional planting for ornamental purposes. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland habitats, contributing to the degradation of local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it poses a significant threat to biodiversity in the region.</p>
