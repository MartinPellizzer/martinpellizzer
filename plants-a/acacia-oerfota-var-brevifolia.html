                        <h1>Acacia oerfota var. brevifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia oerfota var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, yellow flowers arranged in cylindrical spikes, typical of the Acacia genus. The leaves are bipinnate, with numerous tiny leaflets that give the plant a feathery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia oerfota var. brevifolia is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and southwestern Angola.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in savanna and shrubland habitats. This variant is known for its compact growth form and is often used as a source of fodder for livestock. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia oerfota var. brevifolia was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates where it can thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of browse for livestock. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, it remains an important species in certain ecological and agricultural contexts.</p>
