                <h1>Achyranthes thonningii</h1>
<p>Achyranthes thonningii, commonly known as African knotweed, is a perennial herb native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by cylindrical, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The roots of Achyranthes thonningii are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes thonningii has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, slightly hairy texture and a reddish-brown color, growing in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with greenish-white petals, blooming from July to September, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes thonningii is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Nigeria, Sudan, and Kenya.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist savannas, riverbanks, and swampy areas where it thrives in humid conditions. This plant is also present in parts of southern Arabia and the Indian subcontinent, though its distribution is more limited there. It prefers well-drained to moderately wet soils and is often found in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its native range extends across parts of East and Central Africa, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes thonningii was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has established itself in various habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, waste lands, and along riverbanks. The plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution is expanding as a result of human activity and climate change.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
