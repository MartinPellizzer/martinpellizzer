                    <h1>Acacia desertorum</h1>
<p>Acacia desertorum, commonly known as the desert acacia, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, feathery leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Acacia desertorum is adapted to survive in poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Its presence often indicates a stable, low-nutrient ecosystem.</p>
