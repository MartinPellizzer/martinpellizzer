                <h1>Acrostichum callipteris</h1>
<p>Acrostichum callipteris, commonly known as the broadleaf hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are often followed by orange or red seed pods. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found near water sources.</p>
<p>Its foliage is popular in horticulture for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum callipteris has large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a feather-like structure and a broad, spreading arrangement.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and sturdy, with smooth, grayish bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in the late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dark, globose drupe that contains a single seed, dispersed primarily by water and animals.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum callipteris is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is commonly found in mangrove swamps and salt marshes. This plant is well adapted to brackish water conditions and can tolerate periodic flooding. Its distribution extends along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the continent.</p>
<p>It is also present in some Caribbean islands where the climate is warm and moist.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum callipteris was mainly introduced to disturbed sites such as roadsides, vacant lots, and construction areas due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is often found in wet or moist environments, making it a common invader in riparian zones and along stream banks. This plant can form dense stands that outcompete native vegetation, leading to reduced biodiversity in invaded areas. Its introduction has been documented in several regions of the southeastern United States, where it has become a problematic invasive species.</p>
<p>Management efforts typically involve mechanical removal and herbicide application to control its spread.</p>
