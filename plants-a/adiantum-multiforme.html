                <h1>Adiantum multiforme</h1>
<p>Adiantum multiforme, commonly known as the variable maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often arching or drooping, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with sporangia clusters forming on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum multiforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum multiforme has fern-like leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a delicate, feathery appearance, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 10â€“30 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a pale, silvery underside. The stem is slender and creeping, with a smooth, light green bark that grows horizontally along the ground. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in late spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a slender, cylindrical capsule that releases minute seeds through mechanical means.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish new colonies.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum multiforme is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in forested areas with high humidity. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often seen growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its native range extends to parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands as well.</p>
<p>It is a versatile plant that adapts well to a variety of microhabitats within its native distribution.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum multiforme was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive fronds and adaptability. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is considered invasive in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
