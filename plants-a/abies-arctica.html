<p>Abies arctica, commonly known as the Arctic fir, is a small evergreen conifer native to the Arctic regions of North America and northern Europe.</p>
<p>It is adapted to harsh, cold climates and grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The tree has a compact, shrub-like form with short, stiff branches and needle-like leaves that are dark green and often covered in a waxy cuticle. It produces cones that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length, containing small, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and specialized habitat, Abies arctica is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in Arctic ecosystems.</p>
