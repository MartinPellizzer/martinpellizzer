                    <h1>Agrostis canina var. mertensii</h1>
<p>Agrostis canina var. mertensii, commonly known as the Mertens' bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is often found in moist, well-drained soils, such as those in meadows and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its fine texture and ability to thrive in shaded or semi-shaded conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is sometimes used in horticulture for ground cover due to its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
