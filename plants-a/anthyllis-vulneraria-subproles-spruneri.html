                    <h1>Anthyllis vulneraria subproles spruneri</h1>
<p>Anthyllis vulneraria subproles spruneri, commonly known as the spruneri anthyllis, is a member of the legume family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to rocky and arid environments, this plant is adapted to poor soils and can often be found in Mediterranean climates. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobia makes it an important pioneer species in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and growth habits reflect its evolutionary adaptation to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
