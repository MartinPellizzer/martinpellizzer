                <h1>Aconitum duclouxii</h1>
<p>Aconitum duclouxii, commonly known as the Ducloux aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed leaflets that are covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Aconitum duclouxii contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum duclouxii has basal leaves that are compound, with palmate lobes, dark green in color, and arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a rough texture, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes darker as the plant matures. Its flowers are blue to purple in color, with spurred petals and are arranged in a raceme, blooming in late summer; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storage and anchoring the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum duclouxii is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of this area, particularly in provinces such as Sichuan, Hubei, and Guizhou. This plant thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is commonly found in forested areas and along rocky slopes.</p>
<p>The species is known for its striking blue to purple flowers and is a member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum duclouxii was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its striking purple flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in various regions, particularly in the Pacific Northwest and parts of California. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain environments.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
