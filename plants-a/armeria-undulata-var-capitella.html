<p>Armeria undulata var. capitella, commonly known as the seaside thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense clusters of silver-gray foliage. The plant produces showy clusters of pink or red flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and coastal winds.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in coastal landscaping and rock gardens.</p>
