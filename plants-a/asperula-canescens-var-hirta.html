                    <h1>Asperula canescens var. hirta</h1>
<p>Asperula canescens var. hirta, commonly known as the hairy woodruff, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has a dense, mat-forming habit with hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable ground cover in woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its sweet scent and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
