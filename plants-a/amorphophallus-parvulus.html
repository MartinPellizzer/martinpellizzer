                    <h1>Amorphophallus parvulus</h1>
<p>Amorphophallus parvulus, commonly known as the little corpse flower, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its underground corm, which stores nutrients and allows the plant to survive periods of drought. The plant produces a large, solitary inflorescence that can reach up to two meters in height, featuring a spadix surrounded by a spathe. Its flowers are typically unisexual, with separate male and female parts, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>The plant is also notable for its strong, unpleasant odor, which resembles decaying flesh, attracting flies and beetles.</p>
