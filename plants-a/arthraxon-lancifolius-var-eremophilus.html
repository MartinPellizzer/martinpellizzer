                    <h1>Arthraxon lancifolius var. eremophilus</h1>
<p>Arthraxon lancifolius var. eremophilus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arthraxon, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded grasslands.</p>
