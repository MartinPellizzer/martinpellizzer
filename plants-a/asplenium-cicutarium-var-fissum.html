                    <h1>Asplenium cicutarium var. fissum</h1>
<p>Asplenium cicutarium var. fissum, commonly known as the split fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal.</p>
<p>The varietal form *fissum* is distinguished by its more pronounced frond division compared to the typical *cicutarium*.</p>
