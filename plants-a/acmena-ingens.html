<p>Acmena ingens, commonly known as the giant flame tree, is a large evergreen tree native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its striking, showy red flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a leathery texture with prominent veins. Its bark is smooth and often exhibits a reddish or brownish color, which becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its vibrant floral displays.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena ingens has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a smooth texture and a size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in nutrient-poor soils and aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena ingens is a tropical tree native to the eastern and southern regions of Australia, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas of lowland and coastal regions, though it is now rare and primarily found in fragmented populations. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils within rainforests or adjacent habitats. Acmena ingens typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is listed as endangered in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
