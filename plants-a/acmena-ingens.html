                <h1>Acmena ingens</h1>
<p>Acmena ingens, commonly known as the giant acmena, is a large evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are glossy green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. The tree produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing several seeds. Acmena ingens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens for its dense canopy and shade-providing qualities.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by supporting a variety of wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena ingens has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight, upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, clustered in inflorescences, and bloom during the wet season, primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant anchor firmly in the soil and access water from deeper layers.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena ingens is primarily native to eastern Australia, specifically the states of Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rainforest and moist sclerophyll forest communities. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Acmena ingens is an important component of the local flora and is well adapted to the subtropical and temperate climates of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena ingens was mainly introduced to enhance biodiversity in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and ornamental value. It has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, Australia, and parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
