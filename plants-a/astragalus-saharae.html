                    <h1>Astragalus saharae</h1>
<p>Astragalus saharae, commonly known as the Saharan milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa, particularly the Sahara Desert.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant has adapted to extreme desert conditions with deep taproots and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Astragalus saharae is also of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
