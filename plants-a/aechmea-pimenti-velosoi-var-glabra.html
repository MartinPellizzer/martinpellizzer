                    <h1>Aechmea pimenti-velosoi var. glabra</h1>
<p>Aechmea pimenti-velosoi var. glabra, commonly known as the velvet leaf pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, waxy, and often velvety leaves that form a rosette shape, creating a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant's foliage is typically green with a bluish or purple tinge, and it produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens.</p>
