                    <h1>Acinos arvensis var. argutus</h1>
<p>Acinos arvensis var. argutus, commonly known as the rough hawkbit, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a dense, compact inflorescence, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Its ability to colonize such environments makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
