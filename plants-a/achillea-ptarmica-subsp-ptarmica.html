<p>Achillea ptarmica subsp.</p>
<p>ptarmica, commonly known as lesser yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of gray-green, fern-like leaves and produces flat, composite flower heads in shades of white, pink, or red.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly woolly foliage and is often used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
<p>The subspecies ptarmica is distinguished by its smaller flowers and more compact growth compared to other Achillea species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea ptarmica subsp.</p>
<p>ptarmica has basal leaves that are lanceolate to linear, with a grayish-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged in a rosette formation. The stem is erect, hairy, and has a light green to brownish color, with a branching growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are composite, consisting of ray florets in a yellow color surrounded by yellow disk florets, blooming from June to August and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a achene, dispersed by wind due to its feathery pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea ptarmica subsp.</p>
<p>ptarmica is a perennial herb native to southern Europe, including regions such as Spain, Italy, and the Balkans. Its current distribution has expanded to parts of North America and other temperate regions due to horticultural introduction.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. This subspecies typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>It is considered of least concern for conservation status, as it is relatively widespread and adaptable in its preferred habitats.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea ptarmica subsp.</p>
<p>ptarmica is a hardy perennial plant known for its feathery foliage and yellow flowers, commonly used in gardens for its ornamental value.

This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in early spring and blooming in late summer, and it enters a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering that can lead to root rot. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
