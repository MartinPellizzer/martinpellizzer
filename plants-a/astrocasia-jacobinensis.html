                    <h1>Astrocasia jacobinensis</h1>
<p>Astrocasia jacobinensis, commonly known as the Jacobin's star-leaf, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters along the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky or well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
