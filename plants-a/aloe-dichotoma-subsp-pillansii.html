<p>Aloe dichotoma subsp.</p>
<p>pillansii, commonly known as the "Karoo aloe," is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its branching, tree-like structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>
