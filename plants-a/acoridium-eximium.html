                <h1>Acoridium eximium</h1>
<p>Acoridium eximium, commonly known as the golden spike lily, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acoraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiky inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Acoridium eximium is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoridium eximium has narrow, elongated leaves that are linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that remains unbranched. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium eximium is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in swampy or wetland habitats, often growing in association with mangroves or other waterlogged soils. This plant is also known to occur in parts of southern China and northern Australia. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal areas or near rivers.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium eximium was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in wetland habitats. The plant spreads rapidly through its rhizomes, leading to the degradation of local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are now underway to control its spread and protect native flora.</p>
