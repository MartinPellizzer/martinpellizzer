                <h1>Acilepis scariosa</h1>
<p>Acilepis scariosa, commonly known as the brittleleaf daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers surrounded by pale green ray florets. The plant has hairy, often brittle leaves that are adapted to arid environments. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands.</p>
<p>Acilepis scariosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and visual interest.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis scariosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows in a climbing or trailing habit. Its small, clustered flowers are white with a yellow center, featuring five petals and stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis scariosa is primarily native to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the island's tropical and subtropical regions. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its distinctive leaf and flower structures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Sri Lanka.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis scariosa was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats like roadsides, waste areas, and cultivated fields. The plant has adapted well to a variety of soil types and climate conditions, contributing to its widespread distribution. Its ability to reproduce rapidly and form dense stands makes it an invasive species in many regions.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities in some parts of the world.</p>
