                <h1>Acer affine</h1>
<p>Acer affine, commonly known as the rock maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, often found in mountainous regions. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>Acer affine is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer affine has palmate leaves that are typically 5-9 lobes, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>The stems are smooth and slender, with a light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and they grow as shrubs or small trees. The flowers are small, yellow-green, and clustered in cymes, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils where the plant thrives.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer affine is a species of maple native to eastern Asia, specifically China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is now widely distributed in cultivation across temperate regions of the world, including North America and Europe. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or forested areas. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Acer affine is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status due to its adaptability and widespread cultivation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer affine is a small to medium-sized maple tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer affine includes a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and annual pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with other shade-tolerant plants in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer affine is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, while its seeds are consumed by birds and small mammals. It acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity by creating microhabitats. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by improving soil quality and offering habitat for numerous organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer affine is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability, making it a popular choice in horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas. In medicinal contexts, it has been studied for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, its wood is valued for its durability and is used in furniture and construction.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty, often featured in local art and folklore.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer affine has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Sutherlandii' and 'Piscinaria', which are known for their striking foliage and compact growth habits. Hybrids of Acer affine are often created to enhance traits such as hardiness, leaf color, and form. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their adaptability to various garden conditions.</p>
<p>They are widely used in landscaping and as specimen trees in temperate climates.</p>
