                <h1>Acosta stoebe</h1>
<p>Acosta stoebe, commonly known as mountain flax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are clustered in terminal spikes.</p>
<p>Acosta stoebe is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta stoebe has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a palmate pattern, each about 1-2 cm in length, and they are typically a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a rough texture, growing in a clumping pattern with a reddish-brown bark. The flowers are small, clustered in dense heads, with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene that is dispersed by wind due to its feathery附属物.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and establish new colonies.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta stoebe is primarily native to Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in southern France, Spain, Italy, and parts of Turkey. This plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often growing in open woodlands and alpine meadows. It is known for its small, pinkish flowers and is part of the Boraginaceae family.</p>
<p>Acosta stoebe has also been introduced to other parts of the world, including North America, where it is sometimes considered an invasive species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta stoebe was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas, becoming a common weed in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types have contributed to its successful establishment in new environments. It is particularly invasive in regions with temperate climates and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive spread, it is now considered a noxious weed in several states across the United States.</p>
