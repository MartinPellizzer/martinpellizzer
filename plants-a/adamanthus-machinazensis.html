                <h1>Adamanthus machinazensis</h1>
<p>Adamanthus machinazensis, commonly known as the Brazilian hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Adamanthus machinazensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adamanthus machinazensis has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lance-shaped leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, measuring approximately 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a spreading growth habit. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, arranged in panicles, and bloom during the late spring to early summer, relying on insect pollination, primarily by bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in dry, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamanthus machinazensis is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest biome of Brazil.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the states of Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, and São Paulo. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soils. Adamanthus machinazensis is commonly found in secondary growth areas and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within the Brazilian coastal rainforests.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamanthus machinazensis was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields. This plant has a rapid growth rate and can spread through seeds dispersed by wind and water. Due to its adaptability, it has become invasive in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is expanding as a result of human activity and climate change.</p>
