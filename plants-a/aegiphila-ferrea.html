                <h1>Aegiphila ferrea</h1>
<p>Aegiphila ferrea, commonly known as ironwood or Brazilian ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has aromatic leaves that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Aegiphila ferrea plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila ferrea has compound, opposite leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged in pairs along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically reddish-brown in color. Its small, clustered flowers are pink to purple in color, with five petals and a tubular corolla, blooming in the spring and attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies through nectar. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help stabilize the plant in its native rocky or sandy soils.</p>
