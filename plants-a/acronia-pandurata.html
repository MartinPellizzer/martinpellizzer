                <h1>Acronia pandurata</h1>
<p>Acronia pandurata, commonly known as the pandurata acronia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture.</p>
<p>Acronia pandurata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a decorative plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia pandurata has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging in size from 3 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, featuring pale yellow petals and stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat by anchoring it in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia pandurata is primarily native to the Caribbean region, particularly the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and the Bahamas. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within tropical forests. It is often associated with limestone soils and is commonly found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia pandurata was mainly introduced to specific regions in the Mediterranean Basin, where it has established populations in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and urban areas.</p>
<p>This distribution is largely due to its ability to thrive in dry, sunny environments with well-drained soils. It is often found in areas with low vegetation cover, which allows it to compete successfully with native species. The introduction of Acronia pandurata has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Despite its limited range, it has shown a capacity for local spread, making it a species of interest for ecological monitoring.</p>
