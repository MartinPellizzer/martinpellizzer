                    <h1>Alisma subulatum</h1>
<p>Alisma subulatum, commonly known as the slender water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or wetlands, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous root system helps it anchor in muddy substrates and absorb nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Alisma subulatum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
