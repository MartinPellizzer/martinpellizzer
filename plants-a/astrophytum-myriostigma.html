<p>Astrophytum myriostigma, commonly known as the "star cactus," is a species of cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, rounded stems that are covered in radial spines and are often mistaken for a rock due to their shape. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
