                <h1>Adicea obliqua</h1>
<p>Adicea obliqua, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a member of the Acanthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive zigzagging stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adicea obliqua is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea obliqua has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly woody, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white to pale pink petals, blooming in the spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea obliqua is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in humid climates and is typically associated with rainforests and secondary growth areas. Its distribution is also observed in parts of Argentina and Ecuador.</p>
<p>Adicea obliqua is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea obliqua was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and ornamental plant use.</p>
<p>It has been observed in regions with temperate climates, particularly in parts of Europe and North America. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in open areas. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Proper monitoring is essential to assess its impact on local flora and fauna.</p>
