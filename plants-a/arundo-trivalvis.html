                    <h1>Arundo trivalvis</h1>
<p>Arundo trivalvis, commonly known as the three-valved reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hollow, cylindrical stems and long, narrow leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which appear in late summer. Arundo trivalvis is adapted to grow in wet or marshy environments, making it a common sight in riparian zones.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
