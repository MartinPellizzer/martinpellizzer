<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or red in color. Its fruits are fleshy berries that contain numerous seeds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Adenia inermis is often found in rainforests and along stream banks, where it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia inermis has leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a deep green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, woody, and has a rough, greyish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips.

<p>This plant is found in the dry to semi-arid regions of these countries. It typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions. Adenia inermis is part of the Passifloraceae family and is known for its distinctive foliage.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its ability to thrive in the unique ecosystems of East Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia inermis was mainly introduced to the eastern and southeastern regions of Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils, often growing in open woodlands or heathlands. This plant is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil.</p>
