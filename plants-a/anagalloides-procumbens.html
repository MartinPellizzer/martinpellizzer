                    <h1>Anagalloides procumbens</h1>
<p>Anagalloides procumbens, commonly known as creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Anagalloides procumbens is often found in disturbed soils, along trails, and in open woodland areas.</p>
