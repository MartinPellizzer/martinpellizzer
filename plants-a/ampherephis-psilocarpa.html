<p>Ampherephis psilocarpa, commonly known as the purple-spored bracket fungus, is a species of bracket fungus belonging to the family Phallaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, saddle-shaped cap and a thick, fleshy stem that often has a purple or reddish hue. The fruiting bodies typically grow on decaying wood, particularly in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are released from a unique, sac-like structure called a gleba, which is enclosed within the cap.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ecological role in decomposing organic matter in forest ecosystems.</p>
