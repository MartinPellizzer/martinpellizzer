                    <h1>Aloe perfoliata var. arborescens</h1>
<p>Aloe perfoliata var. arborescens, commonly known as the tree aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branching, tree-like structure with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in arid environments. It produces yellowish-green flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, adding ornamental value to the plant.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for xeriscaping and thrives in full sun with minimal water.</p>
