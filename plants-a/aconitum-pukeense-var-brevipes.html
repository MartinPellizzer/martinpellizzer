<p>Aconitum pukeense var. brevipes, commonly known as the Pukeko River aconite, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, spikelike clusters.
