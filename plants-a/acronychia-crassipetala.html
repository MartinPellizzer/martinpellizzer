                <h1>Acronychia crassipetala</h1>
<p>Acronychia crassipetala, commonly known as the thick-leaved acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that are often glossy and dark green in color. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange, followed by woody fruits containing one or two seeds.</p>
<p>This plant is often valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in some local cultures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia crassipetala has alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are glossy green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a pointed tip and a broad base.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and greyish-brown, with a growth pattern that is usually upright and branching. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, with five petals and a prominent central stamen, blooming during the wet season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia crassipetala is primarily native to Queensland.</p>
<p>It is found in the northeastern part of the state, particularly in the rainforest regions. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical and subtropical forests. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and high humidity.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Queensland's diverse landscape.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia crassipetala was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal and lowland environments where sunlight is abundant. This plant is often found in disturbed sites, such as roadsides and abandoned farmland, due to its adaptability. Its distribution has expanded in regions with similar ecological conditions to its native habitat in northeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
