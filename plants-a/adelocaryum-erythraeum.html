                <h1>Adelocaryum erythraeum</h1>
<p>Adelocaryum erythraeum, commonly known as the red sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Arabian Peninsula and the Red Sea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant thrives in saline and arid environments, making it well adapted to coastal and desert conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, which helps it retain moisture in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Adelocaryum erythraeum is often found growing along rocky shores and in sandy soils near the shoreline.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelocaryum erythraeum has leaves that are elongated, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white in color, with five petals and a tubular structure, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to efficiently absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelocaryum erythraeum is primarily native to the coastal regions of the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Oman.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy soils near the shoreline. This plant is commonly associated with dune ecosystems and is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region. It plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelocaryum erythraeum was mainly introduced to coastal regions of South Africa, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy and disturbed soils, often outcompeting native vegetation. The plant spreads rapidly through its prolific seed production and ability to establish itself in fragmented habitats. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity and ecosystem stability.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to monitor and manage its spread to prevent further ecological damage.</p>
