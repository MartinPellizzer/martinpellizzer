<p>Agrostis canina var. varians, commonly known as the variable bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
