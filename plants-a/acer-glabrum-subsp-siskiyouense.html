                <h1>Acer glabrum subsp. siskiyouense</h1>
<p>Acer glabrum subsp.</p>
<p>siskiyouense, commonly known as the Siskiyou maple, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the Siskiyou Mountains in Oregon and California. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, palmately compound leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed coniferous forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum subsp.</p>
<p>siskiyouense has palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length, with a bright green color during the growing season and a striking red or orange hue in autumn. The leaves are alternate in arrangement and have a smooth, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellow-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous, anchoring the plant in rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum subsp.</p>
<p>siskiyouense is a rare subspecies of maple native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States, specifically found in northern California and southern Oregon. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations, primarily in the Siskiyou Mountains.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils in mixed evergreen and coniferous forests. It typically grows at elevations between 900 and 1,500 meters. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is listed as endangered by the U.S.</p>
<p>Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum subsp.</p>
<p>siskiyouense is a unique maple species native to the Pacific Northwest, known for its striking red foliage and ornamental value. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination.</p>
<p>This shrub or small tree has a slow growth cycle, often reaching maturity over several decades. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications in early spring, and pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and promote health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or leaf spot, and it pairs well with other native plants like ferns and evergreens in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum subsp.</p>
<p>siskiyouense is a hardy shrub that provides essential food and shelter for local wildlife, including birds and small mammals. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for land restoration projects.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a variety of organisms within its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum subsp.</p>
<p>siskiyouense is a rare, small tree native to the Siskiyou Mountains of California and Oregon. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been historically used by Indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes, including treating skin conditions and as a pain reliever.</p>
<p>The tree's wood, though not commonly used in industry, contributes to local biodiversity and supports wildlife. It holds cultural significance for the Klamath and Modoc tribes, who view it as a symbol of resilience and connection to the land.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological importance, it also plays a role in conservation efforts and ecological research.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer glabrum subsp.</p>
<p>siskiyouense has several popular cultivars such as 'Autumn Flame' and 'Crimson Cloud', which are prized for their vibrant fall color and compact growth habits. This species is also a parent in various hybrids, including those with maple species like *Acer palmatum* and *Acer truncatum*, contributing to the diversity of ornamental maples.</p>
<p>Its horticultural importance lies in its adaptability to a range of climates and its ability to thrive in urban environments. The subspecies is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and seasonal interest.</p>
<p>Due to its unique characteristics, it remains a valuable addition to both private gardens and public landscapes.</p>
