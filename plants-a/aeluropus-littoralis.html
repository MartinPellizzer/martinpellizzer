                <h1>Aeluropus littoralis</h1>
<p>Aeluropus littoralis, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in salt marshes and estuaries. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain minute grains of wheat-like seeds. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeluropus littoralis has narrow, grass-like leaves that are flat, linear, and typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually 2–5 cm long and 2–4 mm wide, with a blue-gray or silver-green color due to a dense covering of hairs. The stem is erect, cylindrical, and smooth, with a grayish-green color and a growth pattern that is usually clump-forming. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-angled, three-lobed spikelet that disperses its seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant stabilize in sandy or coastal soils.</p>
