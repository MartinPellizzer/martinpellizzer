<p>Aegilops geniculata subsp.</p>
<p>globulosa, commonly known as the globular wild oat, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, globular inflorescence, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, spikelet-based flowers.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic contribution to cultivated wheat.</p>
