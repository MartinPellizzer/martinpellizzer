                    <h1>Artemisia aemula</h1>
<p>Artemisia aemula, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that reflect light and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters in late spring, which are borne on slender, branching stems. Artemisia aemula thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its aromatic leaves contain volatile oils that contribute to its distinctive scent and potential medicinal properties.</p>
