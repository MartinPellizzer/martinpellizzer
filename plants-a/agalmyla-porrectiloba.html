<p>Agalmyla porrectiloba, commonly known as the straight-stemmed agalmyla, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along forest floors or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often emitting a mild, spicy scent when crushed.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Agalmyla porrectiloba is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
