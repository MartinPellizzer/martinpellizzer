                    <h1>Acacia maritima</h1>
<p>Acacia maritima, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, bipinnate leaves that reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which attract a variety of pollinators. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds.</p>
<p>Acacia maritima plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
