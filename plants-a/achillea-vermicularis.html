                <h1>Achillea vermicularis</h1>
<p>Achillea vermicularis, commonly known as yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and flat, composite flower heads that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Achillea vermicularis is known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea vermicularis has compound, finely divided leaves that are narrow, linear, and arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-gray color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and hairy, with a light green color and a branching pattern that becomes more complex as the plant matures. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in flat-topped umbels, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and pappus-like structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea vermicularis is primarily native to Iran, Iraq, Transcaucasus, and Turkey.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in dry, rocky, or gravelly habitats across these regions. It thrives in temperate climates and is often seen in mountainous areas. The species is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its adaptability to diverse environmental conditions in the Middle East and adjacent regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea vermicularis was mainly introduced to ornamental and horticultural purposes due to its attractive, fern-like foliage and ability to thrive in various soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic value and low maintenance requirements. However, its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain regions. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been widely cultivated outside its natural range.</p>
<p>Its spread can sometimes outcompete native vegetation, raising ecological concerns in non-native habitats.</p>
