<p>Alsophila australis subsp.</p>
<p>norfolkensis, commonly known as the Norfolk Island tree fern, is a distinctive evergreen fern native to Norfolk Island in the South Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Its fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This subspecies is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes.</p>
