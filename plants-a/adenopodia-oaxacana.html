                <h1>Adenopodia oaxacana</h1>
<p>Adenopodia oaxacana, commonly known as the Oaxaca adenopodia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Oaxaca, Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Adenopodia oaxacana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenopodia oaxacana has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring 2â€“5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are cylindrical, slightly hairy, and have a light green to brownish bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals and yellow stamens, blooming from May to July, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopodia oaxacana is primarily native to Mexico Southwest.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of the state of Oaxaca. It thrives in humid, forested areas at high elevations. Adenopodia oaxacana is adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native habitat.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the local biodiversity in this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopodia oaxacana was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in the southern United States, particularly in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. It spreads through both seeds and vegetative reproduction, making it a persistent invasive species in these regions.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a concern for local ecosystems where it outcompetes native flora.</p>
