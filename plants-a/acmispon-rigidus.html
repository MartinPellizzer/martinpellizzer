<p>Acmispon rigidus, commonly known as rigid milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with slender, hairy stems that often branch near the base. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its trifoliate leaves are pinnately divided, and the plant is adapted to dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Acmispon rigidus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment in arid environments.</p>
