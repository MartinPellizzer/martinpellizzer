                <h1>Acmispon rigidus</h1>
<p>Acmispon rigidus, commonly known as rigid milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with slender, hairy stems that often branch near the base. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its trifoliate leaves are pinnately divided, and the plant is adapted to dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Acmispon rigidus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmispon rigidus has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, often branching, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, featuring yellow petals and a distinctive blue-violet center, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a cylindrical pod that splits open to release small, oblong seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant thrive in disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon rigidus is primarily native to Arizona, California, Mexico Northwest, Nevada, and Utah.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these states. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in desert environments. Acmispon rigidus is known for its resilience to drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the specific ecological conditions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon rigidus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was introduced as a forage plant for livestock. The plant is now considered invasive in certain areas of the country. It has spread through disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands have raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
