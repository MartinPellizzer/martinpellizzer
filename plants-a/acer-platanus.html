                    <h1>Acer platanus</h1>
<p>Acer platanus, commonly known as the European plane tree, is a large deciduous tree native to Europe, western Asia, and northwestern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse by wind. Its bark is thick, scaly, and becomes fissured with age, providing a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The European plane tree is often planted in urban areas for its shade and ornamental value.</p>
