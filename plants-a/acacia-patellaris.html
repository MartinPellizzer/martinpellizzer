                    <h1>Acacia patellaris</h1>
<p>Acacia patellaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are composed of numerous tiny leaflets. The plant produces yellow, globular flowerheads that appear in late winter to early spring, attracting various pollinators. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its hardiness and is often used in landscaping in dry climates.</p>
