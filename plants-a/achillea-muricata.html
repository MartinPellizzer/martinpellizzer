                <h1>Achillea muricata</h1>
<p>Achillea muricata, commonly known as yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flat-topped clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers and its feathery, aromatic leaves. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a common sight in meadows and dry habitats. Its genus name honors Achilles, the legendary Greek hero, due to its historical use in treating wounds.</p>
<p>Achillea muricata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea muricata has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a slightly hairy texture, and exhibits a reddish-brown color, growing upright and branching sparingly. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea muricata is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly the Mediterranean Basin, including countries like Spain, Portugal, and southern France.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of North Africa and the Middle East, where it has been introduced or naturalized. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as threatened, its habitat is vulnerable to land-use changes and climate change, leading to concerns about its long-term conservation status.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea muricata is a hardy perennial known for its feathery foliage and vibrant yellow flowers, commonly cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. The plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering occurring in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding wet roots. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and regular pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea muricata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its beneficial properties. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea muricata contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and supporting biodiversity in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea muricata is a versatile plant with a range of uses and applications across various domains.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, it is occasionally used as a spice or flavoring due to its aromatic properties.
