                <h1>Achillea muricata</h1>
<p>Achillea muricata, commonly known as the European yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features a robust rhizomatous root system and can grow up to 1 meter tall, with a basal rosette of silver-gray, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flower heads, which are composed of numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its name is derived from the Greek myth of Achilles, who used the plant to treat wounds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea muricata has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are lance-shaped, gray-green in color, and covered with fine hairs, typically measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are cylindrical, somewhat woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark, and they grow upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green composite flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea muricata is primarily native to southern Europe, particularly the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, and Greece. This plant thrives in rocky and dry environments, often growing on slopes and cliffs. It is also present in parts of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to regions with a Mediterranean climate characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea muricata was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in regions where it has been planted for its hardy nature. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in harsh conditions, making it a popular choice for land reclamation projects. However, its invasive potential has led to concerns about its spread beyond intended areas.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, Achillea muricata requires careful management to prevent it from becoming a nuisance in native ecosystems.</p>
