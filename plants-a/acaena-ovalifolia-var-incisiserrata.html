                        <h1>Acaena ovalifolia var. incisiserrata</h1>
<p>Acaena ovalifolia var. incisiserrata, commonly known as the serrated bramble, is a shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are ovate to elliptic in shape and have serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by burrs containing seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its prickly fruits, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena ovalifolia var. incisiserrata is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the South Island, particularly in the mountainous regions of the western and southern parts. This variety thrives in moist, shaded environments such as beech forests and areas with high rainfall. It is commonly associated with the presence of kahikatea and rimu trees.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the cool, temperate climate of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena ovalifolia var. incisiserrata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. This plant is now considered an invasive species in certain regions of New Zealand. It spreads rapidly in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its presence has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
