                    <h1>Acaena polycarpa</h1>
<p>Acaena polycarpa, commonly known as the many-fruited burrplant, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a member of the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and dense, spherical clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are often covered in hooked bracts, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. Acaena polycarpa thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora.</p>
