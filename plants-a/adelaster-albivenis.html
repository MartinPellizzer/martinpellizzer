                <h1>Adelaster albivenis</h1>
<p>Adelaster albivenis, commonly known as the white-flowered sunflower, is a member of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange composite flowers that are surrounded by white ray florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Adelaster albivenis is native to parts of North America and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelaster albivenis has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a smooth margin and a dull green color, ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are tubular, with five petals, and are pale yellow in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelaster albivenis is primarily native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in the states of Oaxaca, Puebla, and Veracruz. This plant grows in dry to semi-arid regions, often in limestone soils. It is commonly found in scrublands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelaster albivenis was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive white flowers and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in several states, including Texas, California, and Florida, where it has established populations in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Despite its ornamental value, it has the potential to become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly. The plant is often mistaken for native species, making it difficult to control once it becomes established.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists about its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
