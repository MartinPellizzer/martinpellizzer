                <h1>Aegopodium kashmiricum</h1>
<p>Aegopodium kashmiricum, commonly known as Kashmir goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and often hollow stems. The plant produces small, white to greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a fern-like appearance, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegopodium kashmiricum has compound, trifoliate leaves that are ovate to rhombic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and somewhat woody at the base, with a light green to brownish bark that becomes rough with age. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in umbels, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, dispersed by wind due to its small size and feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, shady environments.</p>
