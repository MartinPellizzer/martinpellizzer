                <h1>Acronychia schistacea</h1>
<p>Acronychia schistacea, commonly known as the rock apple or stone apple, is a flowering plant native to northern Australia and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in rocky or coastal environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are usually thick, leathery, and have a rough texture, adapted to withstand arid conditions.</p>
<p>Acronychia schistacea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by Indigenous communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia schistacea has simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a leathery texture and margins that are slightly toothed.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grayish-brown in color, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a dense, upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and helping it absorb nutrients from the surrounding environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia schistacea is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in the northeastern and western regions. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments along the forest floor. It is commonly associated with moist and well-drained soils in lowland and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia schistacea was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas where the climate is warm and humid. This plant has been introduced to several parts of Australia, including Queensland and New South Wales, where it thrives in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and attractive foliage.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
