                        <h1>Abies sachalinensis var. wilsonii</h1>
<p>Abies sachalinensis var. wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's fir, is a variant of the Sakhalin fir, native to the northeastern regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of the typical species. The cones are pendulous and often persist on the branches for several years, contributing to its ornamental value. This variety is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in temperate regions.</p>
