                    <h1>Angervilla</h1>
<p>Angervilla, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, featuring thorny branches and oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Angervilla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in hedgerows and gardens.</p>
<p>Its botanical name, *Crataegus monogyna*, reflects its single-seed fruits and its historical use in herbal medicine.</p>
