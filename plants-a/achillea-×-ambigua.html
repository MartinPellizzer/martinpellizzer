<p>It is a cross between Achillea millefolium (common yarrow) and Achillea ptarmica (sneezeweed), resulting in a plant with a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges, and it is native to Europe and parts of western Asia. Its foliage is aromatic and feathery, with finely divided leaves, while its flowers are small, clustered in flat-topped umbels, usually in shades of white to pale yellow.</p>
<p>Achillea × ambigua is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × ambigua has leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a grayish-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, hairy, and have a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a achene, with small, fluffy seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
