                <h1>Achania coccinea</h1>
<p>Achania coccinea, commonly known as the red-stemmed bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, reddish stems that are often tinged with purple, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Achania coccinea prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable addition to wetland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant floral display and ability to thrive in humid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achania coccinea has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a vibrant green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with bright red petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achania coccinea is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to specific areas within its native habitat. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understorey vegetation. It typically grows at altitudes between 300 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Achania coccinea is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achania coccinea is a vibrant flowering plant known for its striking red blooms and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with the latter method being more reliable for maintaining cultivar characteristics. The plant has a perennial growth cycle, thriving in mild climates and blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning after flowering promote healthy growth. It is relatively pest and disease resistant but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achania coccinea is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its vibrant red flowers attract a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, contributing to biodiversity in its ecosystem. It acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through mutualistic relationships. Additionally, its dense foliage offers shelter and nesting sites for small animals and insects.</p>
<p>Achania coccinea also plays a role in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its root system.</p>
