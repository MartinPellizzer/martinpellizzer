<p>Asplenium adiantum-nigrum subsp.</p>
<p>adiantum-nigrum, commonly known as the black spleenwort, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a dark green to blackish appearance.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of moss-like structures, which help in moisture retention.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance.</p>
