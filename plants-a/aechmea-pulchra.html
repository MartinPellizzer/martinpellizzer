                <h1>Aechmea pulchra</h1>
<p>Aechmea pulchra, commonly known as the velvet plant or the pink pineapple, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, dark green, velvety leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater. The plant produces striking red or pink bracts that enclose its small, white flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Aechmea pulchra is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea pulchra has leaves that are long, strap-like, and arranged in a rosette, with a waxy, dark green surface and a white or silver underside.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, fibrous stem that remains hidden beneath the leaves, and its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in the soil. It produces inflorescences with clustered, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind or water.</p>
<p>Overall, Aechmea pulchra exhibits typical bromeliad morphology with specialized structures for water storage and nutrient absorption.</p>
