                        <h1>Acacia stipulata</h1>
<p>Acacia stipulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant features bipinnate leaves with small, needle-like leaflets, and it produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring. Acacia stipulata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia stipulata is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in savannas, rocky outcrops, and along riverbanks in these areas. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Acacia stipulata is also known for its distinctive yellow flowers and thorny stems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia stipulata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered a potential weed in certain regions. The plant thrives in a range of climates, including temperate and sub-tropical environments, which contributes to its successful establishment. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites have led to concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Management strategies are being developed to control its spread and mitigate its ecological effects.</p>
