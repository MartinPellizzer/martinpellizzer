                    <h1>Abrotanum xerophilum</h1>
<p>Abrotanum xerophilum, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant in dry landscapes.</p>
