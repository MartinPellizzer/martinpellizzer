                <h1>Acokanthera spectabilis</h1>
<p>Acokanthera spectabilis, commonly known as the beautiful poison tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant produces toxic alkaloids, making its sap and leaves harmful to humans and animals. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters.</p>
<p>Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant plays a role in local ecosystems despite its toxic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acokanthera spectabilis has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown to grey in color, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a compact, upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are taprooted, with a well-developed primary root system that helps the plant anchor itself and access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera spectabilis is primarily native to tropical Africa, including countries such as Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid lowland forests and is often found in secondary growth areas. The plant is commonly distributed in regions with a warm and moist climate, typically growing at elevations below 1,500 meters. It is known for its toxic properties and is sometimes referred to as the "poison arrow tree.".</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in both traditional medicine and local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera spectabilis was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it suitable for cultivation in warm, dry environments. The plant is often grown for its ornamental value due to its striking red flowers and its historical use in traditional medicine. However, it is important to note that it can be toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
