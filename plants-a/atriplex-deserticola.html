                    <h1>Atriplex deserticola</h1>
<p>Atriplex deserticola, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, salt-tolerant leaves that help it survive in harsh, saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it well-adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Atriplex deserticola plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
