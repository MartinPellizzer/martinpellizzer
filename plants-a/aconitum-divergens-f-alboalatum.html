                    <h1>Aconitum divergens f. alboalatum</h1>
<p>Aconitum divergens f. alboalatum, commonly known as the white-flowered monkshood, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear dark green, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking blue-violet to white flowers in late summer, arranged in a raceme at the top of the stem. Its foliage and flowers are adorned with distinctive, spurred petals that are typical of the genus Aconitum.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens but is toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids.</p>
