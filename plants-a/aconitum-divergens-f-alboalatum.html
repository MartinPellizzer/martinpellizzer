<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and has a greyish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in racemes, and have a spurred petal structure, blooming in late summer; they are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, adapted for absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum divergens f. alboalatum is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in the Alps and Carpathians.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to specific high-altitude areas in countries like Austria, Italy, and Romania. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as rocky slopes and meadows, often growing in shaded, well-drained soils. This species is typically found at altitudes between 1,800 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is listed as endangered in several regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
