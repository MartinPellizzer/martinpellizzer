                    <h1>Argyrolobium megarhizum</h1>
<p>Argyrolobium megarhizum, commonly known as the giant root vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deep taproot system, which allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves, typical of many leguminous species.</p>
<p>Argyrolobium megarhizum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
