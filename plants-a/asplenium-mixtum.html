<p>Asplenium mixtum, commonly known as the mixed spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with tufts of dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often clustered at the base. Its spore-producing structures, called soridia, are found on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Asplenium mixtum is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
