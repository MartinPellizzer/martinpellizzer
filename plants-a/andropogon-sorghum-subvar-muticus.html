<p>Andropogon sorghum subvar. muticus, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves. This plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for marginal lands. Switchgrass is widely used in biofuel production and ecological restoration due to its high biomass yield and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Its flowering spikes produce small, spikelet-like flowers that are important for pollinators and seed dispersal.</p>
