                <h1>Acinos nanus</h1>
<p>Acinos nanus, commonly known as the dwarf alpine bellflower, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters at the tips of its slender stems. Its leaves are small, hairy, and closely arranged, which helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Acinos nanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos nanus has small, hairy, alternate leaves that are oval to lance-shaped, typically less than 2 cm in length, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is low-growing, with a reddish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly woody, and it spreads horizontally along the ground. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, allowing the plant to thrive in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos nanus is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and parts of Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and coastal areas. This plant thrives in Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters and dry summers. It is often associated with serpentine soils, which are rich in minerals but low in nutrients.</p>
<p>Acinos nanus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos nanus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and subalpine areas. The plant is often associated with disturbed soils and rocky habitats. It has been reported in several regions across the country.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches where it can thrive.</p>
