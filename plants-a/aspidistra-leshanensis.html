<p>Aspidistra leshanensis, commonly known as the Leshan aspidistra, is a rare and endemic species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its dark green, glossy, strap-shaped leaves. The plant is evergreen and thrives in shady, humid environments, making it well-suited for indoor cultivation. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time.</p>
<p>The flowers, though less showy than its foliage, are small and greenish-white, typical of the genus Aspidistra.</p>
