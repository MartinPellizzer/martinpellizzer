                <h1>Acicalyptus fullagarii</h1>
<p>Acicalyptus fullagarii, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it its common name. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. It produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Acicalyptus fullagarii is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acicalyptus fullagarii has narrow, needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally along the stem, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and grows upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when it dries and splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to absorb moisture from the surface soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acicalyptus fullagarii is primarily native to the island of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of the eastern part of the island, particularly in the highland regions. This species thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing in the understorey of dense vegetation. It is commonly associated with rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic plant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acicalyptus fullagarii was mainly introduced to control coastal erosion and for its ornamental value in landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly planted along shorelines and in coastal gardens due to its salt-tolerant properties. The plant thrives in sandy or loamy soils and requires minimal water once established. Its rapid growth and dense foliage make it effective for stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
<p>However, it has been identified as an invasive species in some regions, posing a threat to native ecosystems.</p>
