<p>Ammannia radicans var. floribunda, commonly known as redroot dayflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features upright stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or clusters. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and typically pink or red in color. It thrives in moist, sunny environments such as wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks.</p>
