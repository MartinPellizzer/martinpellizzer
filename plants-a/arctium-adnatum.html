                    <h1>Arctium adnatum</h1>
<p>Arctium adnatum, commonly known as the slender burdock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and foliage with rough, serrated edges. The plant produces spiky, bristly burrs that attach to animals and clothing, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a hairy texture, and it thrives in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>The roots are often harvested for their medicinal properties, though the plant itself is not widely cultivated for commercial purposes.</p>
