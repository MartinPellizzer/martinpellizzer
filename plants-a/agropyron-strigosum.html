<p>Agropyron strigosum, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows.</p>
<p>Agropyron strigosum is valued for its hardiness and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
