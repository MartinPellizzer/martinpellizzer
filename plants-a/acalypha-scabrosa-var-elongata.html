                <h1>Acalypha scabrosa var. elongata</h1>
<p>Acalypha scabrosa var. elongata, commonly known as the velvetleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its velvety, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often surrounded by bracts. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha scabrosa var. elongata has ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, woody texture and a reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in compact clusters during the summer months, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release three winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha scabrosa var. elongata is a variant of the Acalypha scabrosa, native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia.</p>
<p>While it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited, with populations found mainly in specific forested areas of Thailand. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within lowland evergreen forests, typically at altitudes between 200 and 800 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered vulnerable, with conservation efforts underway to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha scabrosa var. elongata is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant, feather-like foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. This plant thrives in a warm climate with a growth cycle that includes a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, avoiding overwatering to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer every few months and regular pruning to maintain shape and encourage new growth are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or fungal infections, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or ornamental grasses can enhance its growth and aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acalypha scabrosa var. elongata is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, colorful bracts. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and offering habitat for beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acalypha scabrosa var. elongata is a decorative shrub commonly used in landscaping for its unique, feathery foliage and vibrant flower clusters.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its ornamental value makes it popular in gardens and public spaces. In traditional medicine, parts of the plant may be used for their potential anti-inflammatory properties, though scientific validation is limited. It also holds cultural significance in some regions, where it is planted for its aesthetic appeal and symbolic meaning.</p>
<p>Economically, it contributes to the horticultural industry by providing ornamental value and supporting local plant trade.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
