                    <h1>Asplenium holophyllum</h1>
<p>Asplenium holophyllum, commonly known as the golden holly fern, is a rare and endangered fern species native to the mountainous regions of Turkey.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, bright yellow fronds that contrast with its dark green undersides. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its fertile fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
