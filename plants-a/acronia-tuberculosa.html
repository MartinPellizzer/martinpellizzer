                <h1>Acronia tuberculosa</h1>
<p>Acronia tuberculosa, commonly known as the roughleaf acronia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its stems are often hairy and have a distinct tuberculate texture, giving it its scientific name.</p>
<p>Acronia tuberculosa is typically found in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia tuberculosa has leaves that are oval-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that releases seeds through wind dispersal, and the seeds are tiny, dry, and equipped with a wing for gliding.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to absorb moisture efficiently from the surface soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia tuberculosa is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically occurring in Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, open woods, and sandy soils. This species thrives in warm, humid climates with ample sunlight. It is often associated with dry to mesic conditions and can be found in both natural and human-altered landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia tuberculosa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high sunlight exposure and well-drained soils. The plant is particularly common in regions with a temperate climate and seasonal rainfall patterns. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it can become invasive in non-native regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded as a result of human activity and habitat alteration.</p>
