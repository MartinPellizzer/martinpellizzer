                    <h1>Agrostis digitata</h1>
<p>Agrostis digitata, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has fine, slender leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common component of natural grasslands.</p>
<p>Agrostis digitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control.</p>
