<p>Aspidium pubirachis, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective layer known as a indusium.</p>
<p>Aspidium pubirachis is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
