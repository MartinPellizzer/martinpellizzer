<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>[WRONG START] Acamptopopappus sphaerocephalus var. sphaerocephalus belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of a complex vascular system and the ability to perform photosynthesis. Its class is Equisetopsida, which includes ferns and horsetails, known for their primitive vascular structures and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is characterized by their diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Asterales, which comprises flowering plants with showy flowers, often arranged in heads, and includes many familiar species like daisies and sunflowers. Its family is Asteraceae, commonly known as the aster family, which is characterized by composite flowers made up of many small florets and includes over 32,000 species. Its genus is Acamptopappus, a group of flowering plants typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, with distinctive capitula and bracteate involucres.</p>
<p>Its species is Acamptopappus sphaerocephalus, a specific variety known for its spherical heads and is native to certain regions of North America.</p>
