                <h1>Acridocarpus humblotii</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus humblotii, commonly known as the Madagascar ebony, is a small evergreen tree native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes cashew and mango trees. The plant is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed surrounded by a hard, woody pulp.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its dense, dark timber and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus humblotii has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a leathery texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green in color, with a simple structure, and they bloom during the dry season, likely through wind pollination. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus humblotii is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>This unique plant is found in the diverse ecosystems of the island, particularly in areas with specific climatic and soil conditions. It is often associated with dry forests and coastal regions, where it thrives in the unique environmental conditions of Madagascar. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are important to protect its natural habitat from threats such as deforestation and land degradation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus humblotii was mainly introduced to new environments as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in various tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some areas of the Americas. The plant is often used in landscaping and horticultural settings for its aesthetic value. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, careful management is needed to prevent unintended ecological impacts.</p>
