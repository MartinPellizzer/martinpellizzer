                <h1>Acrostichum curupirae</h1>
<p>Acrostichum curupirae, commonly known as the Curupira fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swampy areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities.</p>
<p>The Curupira fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum curupirae has large, elongated leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and can reach up to 3 meters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat fibrous, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows vertically along the trunk. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically greenish-yellow in color, which bloom during the wet season and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds through wind, with the seeds being small and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, helping it thrive in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum curupirae is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. This plant is well adapted to humid environments and is commonly associated with coastal and freshwater habitats. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a regionally significant species within its native distribution.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum curupirae was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetlands, along riverbanks, and in disturbed soils where it can establish quickly. This plant is often found in regions with high humidity and consistent rainfall, such as parts of South America and Southeast Asia. Its introduction has sometimes led to its spread into natural habitats, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Despite its adaptability, it is not widely considered a major invasive species in most regions.</p>
