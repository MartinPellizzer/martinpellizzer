                <h1>Achillea lanata</h1>
<p>Achillea lanata, commonly known as the woolly yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and flat, composite flower heads that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a soft, hairy texture, and its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Achillea lanata is often used in herbal medicine and as an ornamental plant in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea lanata has leaves that are lance-shaped, with a silver-gray underside and a dark green upper surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5â€“15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat hairy, and has a grayish-green color, with a branching growth pattern that rises from the base. Its flowers are clustered in flat-topped umbels, with white petals and yellow centers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, allowing for wind dispersal, and the seeds are released in early autumn.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea lanata is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>It is now found in various parts of the world, including North America and Australia, where it has been introduced as an ornamental plant. This species thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and woodland edges. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its status as an invasive species in some regions, it is considered a potential threat to native flora and is monitored for its ecological impact.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea lanata is a hardy perennial known for its fluffy, yellow flower heads and feathery foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The plant has a biennial growth cycle, typically blooming in its second year before dying back.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune dead flowers to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea lanata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, which contribute to the ecosystem's biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. It also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system, which stabilizes soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea lanata offers ecological benefits by supporting local insect populations and contributing to the overall health of the environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea lanata is a flowering plant known for its medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities, which have been traditionally used to treat wounds and skin conditions.</p>
