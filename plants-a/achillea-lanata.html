                <h1>Achillea lanata</h1>
<p>Achillea lanata, commonly known as woolly yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery, fuzzy foliage and flat clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Achillea lanata make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea lanata has leaves that are lance-shaped, with a silvery-gray underside due to a dense covering of fine hairs, and are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and somewhat woody at the base, with a greenish-gray color. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray flowers, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, and the roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea lanata is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas such as southern France, Italy, Spain, and the Iberian Peninsula, with some populations extending into the Middle East. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and disturbed soils. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, Achillea lanata is considered to be of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea lanata is a hardy perennial plant known for its fluffy, white or pale yellow flowers and silvery foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing established clumps, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. The plant has a dormant growth cycle, with new growth emerging in early spring and blooming in late summer, followed by a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Regular fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot in poorly drained conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>
