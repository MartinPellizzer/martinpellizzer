                    <h1>Alaticaulia priscillana</h1>
<p>Alaticaulia priscillana, commonly known as the ancient fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble those of a traditional fern. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires a shaded, well-drained habitat to flourish. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are typically found on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Alaticaulia priscillana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
