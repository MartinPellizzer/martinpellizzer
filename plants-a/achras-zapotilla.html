                <h1>Achras zapotilla</h1>
<p>Achras zapotilla, commonly known as the zapotec tree, is a tropical plant native to southern Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters in height, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces a heavy, inedible fruit that resembles a large, spiky melon, which is often used in traditional medicine. Its bark and leaves contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, making it an important species in local botany and herbal practices.</p>
<p>The tree thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras zapotilla has large, palmate leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with yellowish-green petals and a sweet scent, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a large, spiny capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, anchoring the plant and helping it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras zapotilla is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly Mexico and parts of northern South America.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas in the Caribbean, the southern United States, and some regions of South America where it has been introduced. It thrives in warm, humid environments with well-drained soil, often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. This species typically grows at altitudes between 0 and 600 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Achras zapotilla is considered to be of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras zapotilla is a tropical plant known for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in warm climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of Achras zapotilla includes a slow growth phase followed by rapid expansion during the warm season, with flowering occurring in late summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achras zapotilla is a tropical plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
