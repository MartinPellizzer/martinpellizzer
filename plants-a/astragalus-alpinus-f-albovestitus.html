<p>Astragalus alpinus f. albovestitus, commonly known as the white-haired alpine milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to white. The leaves are pinnately divided, with small, hairy leaflets that contribute to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its adaptation to harsh, high-altitude conditions.</p>
