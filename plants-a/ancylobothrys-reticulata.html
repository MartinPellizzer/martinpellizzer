<p>Ancylobothrys reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, pinnate fronds with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
