                <h1>Acrostichum stramineum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum stramineum, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, and often golden-yellow fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or near water bodies. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, almost feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The golden fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum stramineum has leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and exhibits a light green to brownish color, with a growth pattern that is creeping and rhizomatous. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clustered spikes, blooming during the late spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, with the seeds being dry and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and anchor itself in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum stramineum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of rivers and lakes. This plant thrives in humid environments with poor to moderately fertile soils. It is often associated with mangrove ecosystems and brackish water areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution extends into some Caribbean islands as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum stramineum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and the Gulf Coast regions. This plant thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often associated with coastal and marsh ecosystems. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and human-altered landscapes.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
