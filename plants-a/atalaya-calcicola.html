                    <h1>Atalaya calcicola</h1>
<p>Atalaya calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola atalaya, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions with alkaline soils.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to arid conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, where it thrives in low-nutrient environments. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is often found in association with other xerophytic species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Atalaya calcicola is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health in its native range.</p>
