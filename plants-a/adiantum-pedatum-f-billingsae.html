                    <h1>Adiantum pedatum f. billingsae</h1>
<p>Adiantum pedatum f. billingsae, commonly known as the Billings' maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically shorter and more compact than those of the typical form. The fronds are dark green and have a distinctive, finely divided appearance, with each pinna bearing small, tooth-like projections. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>This fern is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a garden setting.</p>
