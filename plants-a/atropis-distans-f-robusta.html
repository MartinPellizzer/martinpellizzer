                    <h1>Atropis distans f. robusta</h1>
<p>Atropis distans f. robusta, commonly known as the robust form of the slender false hellebore, is a variant of the species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and broader, more robust leaves compared to the typical form. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic compounds.</p>
