                        <h1>Abies lasiocarpa subsp. bifolia</h1>
<p>Abies lasiocarpa subsp.</p>
<p>bifolia, commonly known as the white fir with bifid leaves, is a subspecies of the white fir native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, sharply toothed, bifid (two-lobed) leaves that give it a unique appearance.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in high elevation forests, often in association with other coniferous species. Its cones are cylindrical and maturing in the second year, releasing seeds in the fall.</p>
<p>The subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in mountainous ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies lasiocarpa subsp.</p>
<p>bifolia is primarily native to the western United States, including parts of Colorado, Utah, and Nevada. It is also found in the Great Basin and the Sierra Nevada mountain range.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in high-elevation environments, typically at elevations above 2,500 meters. It is commonly found in subalpine and alpine forests, often growing in association with other coniferous species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to moist, well-drained soils and cool, temperate climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies lasiocarpa subsp.</p>
<p>bifolia was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It has been established in areas with moist, well-drained soils and cool, temperate climates.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in higher elevation forests, where it thrives in shaded, forested environments. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human-assisted propagation.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited compared to the broader Abies lasiocarpa species.</p>
