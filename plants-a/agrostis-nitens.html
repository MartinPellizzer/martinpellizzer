<p>Agrostis nitens, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are clustered closely together.
