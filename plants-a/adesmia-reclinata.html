                <h1>Adesmia reclinata</h1>
<p>Adesmia reclinata, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky or arid environments. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, seed-bearing structures. Its leaves are usually hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Adesmia reclinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia reclinata has small, ovate leaves that are opposite in arrangement, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and twining, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a legume pod containing small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for nutrient absorption in dry, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia reclinata is primarily native to Chile Central.</p>
<p>It is found in the central regions of Chile, including the Valpara√≠so and Maule regions. This plant typically grows in dry, temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with coastal and steppe environments.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific areas within central Chile, where it thrives in open, sunny habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia reclinata was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century by European settlers who admired its aesthetic value. Despite its ornamental appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species for resources. The plant thrives in coastal and disturbed habitats, making it difficult to control once established.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have raised concerns among conservationists.</p>
