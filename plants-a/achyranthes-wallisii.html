<p>Achyranthes wallisii, commonly known as Indian mallow, is a flowering plant belonging to the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes wallisii has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a slightly serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, rough to the touch, and has a brownish color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with a pale greenish-white color, blooming during the summer months, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes wallisii is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
