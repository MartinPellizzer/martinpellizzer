                <h1>Acinodendron donaeanum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron donaeanum, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, featuring a broad, spreading canopy. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron donaeanum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. Its small, clustered flowers are white or pale pink, with four petals, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron donaeanum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Cameroon, and Gabon.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid lowland forests and is commonly found in areas with rich soil and high rainfall. This plant is often associated with secondary growth forests and can be found in both natural and disturbed habitats. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron donaeanum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and human-altered landscapes, such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often colonizing open habitats where competition from native vegetation is reduced. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming an invasive species in regions where it lacks natural predators.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is often found in disturbed environments across parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
