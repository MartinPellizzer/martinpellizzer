                <h1>Adenia miegei</h1>
<p>Adenia miegei, commonly known as the African starwood, is a woody shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers. The plant features rough, often thorny bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically pink or white, with five prominent petals that give it its common name.</p>
<p>Adenia miegei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia miegei has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is generally brown in color, and it grows in a climbing or shrub-like manner. Its flowers are clustered in umbels, featuring white to pale yellow petals and a prominent central stamen, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia miegei is primarily native to eastern Australia, specifically Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is found in the subtropical and tropical rainforests of these regions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments along the understorey of dense forest canopies. It is commonly associated with rocky outcrops and gullies in these areas.</p>
<p>Adenia miegei is a climbing shrub that plays an important role in the local ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia miegei was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in the region due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants. The distribution of Adenia miegei is primarily concentrated in the northern and central parts of New Zealand. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local biodiversity.</p>
