<p>triaristata, commonly known as the three-awned goatgrass, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces spikelets with three awns, giving it its common name, and it typically blooms in the summer months. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
