                <h1>Acronia homalantha</h1>
<p>Acronia homalantha, commonly known as the Hawaiian acronia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forests and stream sides. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia homalantha has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, somewhat woody, and have a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia homalantha is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical areas of countries such as Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in coastal areas and lowland forests. It is often associated with sandy or limestone soils and thrives in humid climates.</p>
<p>Acronia homalantha is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia homalantha was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks. This plant has become naturalized in several regions outside its native range. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is now considered an invasive species in some areas.</p>
