                <h1>Achyrocline rupestris</h1>
<p>Achyrocline rupestris, commonly known as the rock rose or rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or coastal environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are usually pink or white, with a distinctive, slightly hairy appearance. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid climates.</p>
<p>Achyrocline rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and aesthetic value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline rupestris has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a rough, grayish bark that grows in a creeping or upright pattern depending on the environment. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white to pale blue petals and yellow centers, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that releases seeds through mechanical means when dry.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline rupestris is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Argentina Northwest, and Bolivia.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in dry and rocky habitats, often growing on slopes and cliffs. The plant is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>It is a characteristic component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline rupestris was mainly introduced to control invasive weeds in agricultural and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used as a biocontrol agent against plants such as Chromolaena odorata. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in open habitats. It has been introduced to several countries in the Americas, including Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential has raised concerns in some regions where it may outcompete native vegetation.</p>
