                <h1>Acer pedunculatum</h1>
<p>Acer pedunculatum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn brilliant shades of red, orange, and yellow in autumn. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and appear in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow furrows that become more pronounced as the tree ages.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pedunculatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 3â€“6 inches in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and it exhibits a twining growth pattern as it climbs. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and gliding structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pedunculatum is a deciduous tree native to the northeastern United States, specifically found in parts of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few scattered locations, primarily in moist, well-drained soils. It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in mixed hardwood forests and along stream banks. This species typically grows at altitudes between 300 and 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural reproduction, Acer pedunculatum is considered a species of concern and is listed as endangered in some states.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pedunculatum is a small, ornamental maple known for its vibrant fall foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer pedunculatum is relatively slow, with moderate growth rates in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with light feeding in early spring, and pruning is best done in late winter to shape the plant and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects in stressed conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its ornamental value and provide beneficial ecosystem interactions.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pedunculatum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring flowers and provides nectar and pollen. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a range of plant and animal life. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the soil in wetland and riparian areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer pedunculatum contributes to nutrient cycling by supporting microbial activity in the soil.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pedunculatum is a small deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its flowers can be used in small quantities as a flavoring agent. In traditional medicine, it has been used to treat various ailments, including respiratory issues and skin conditions. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and supports wildlife, making it valuable in conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is often appreciated for its aesthetic appeal and is used in landscaping and horticulture.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pedunculatum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Drummondii' and 'Summer Silk,' which are known for their striking red foliage and unique leaf shapes. Hybrids of Acer pedunculatum are often created to enhance traits such as hardiness, color, and growth form. These cultivars and hybrids play a significant role in horticulture, especially in ornamental gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Their aesthetic appeal and adaptability make them important choices for gardeners and landscapers.</p>
