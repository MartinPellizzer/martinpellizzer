                <h1>Acmispon helleri</h1>
<p>Acmispon helleri, commonly known as Heller's burclover, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a hairy coating. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmispon helleri has leaves that are elliptical to lance-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, cylindrical, and somewhat woody, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent pod that releases small, elongated seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon helleri is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Texas. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open habitats. It is commonly associated with desert scrub and grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Acmispon helleri is well adapted to drought conditions and can tolerate high temperatures.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon helleri was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southwestern regions.</p>
<p>It was brought in for its ornamental value due to its attractive blue-green foliage and small white flowers. The plant has since been found growing in various habitats, including disturbed soils and rocky areas. It is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
