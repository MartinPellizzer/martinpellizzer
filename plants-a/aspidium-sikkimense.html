<p>Aspidium sikkimense, commonly known as the Sikkim shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Himalayan regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Aspidium sikkimense is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
