                    <h1>Alnus viridis var. stenoptera</h1>
<p>Alnus viridis var. stenoptera, commonly known as the narrowleaf alder, is a variant of the green alder native to North America.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wetlands. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. Its small, yellowish-green catkins appear in early spring, followed by small, oval nuts that mature in the fall.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation.</p>
