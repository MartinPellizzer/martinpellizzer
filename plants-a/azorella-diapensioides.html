                    <h1>Azorella diapensioides</h1>
<p>Azorella diapensioides, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, which helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, reducing water loss in its arid environment. It produces tiny, greenish flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a subtle touch of color to the rocky landscape.</p>
<p>Azorella diapensioides is well adapted to cold temperatures and high altitudes, making it a resilient component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
