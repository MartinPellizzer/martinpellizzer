                    <h1>Amyema arthrocaulis</h1>
<p>Amyema arthrocaulis, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in rocky, coastal environments.</p>
<p>It forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions. The plant's thallus is typically flat and leaf-like, with a dark green to blackish upper surface. It is often found on exposed rock surfaces, where it plays a role in soil formation and provides habitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, Amyema arthrocaulis is considered an indicator species for coastal ecosystems.</p>
