                    <h1>Asplenium morogorense</h1>
<p>Asplenium morogorense, commonly known as the Morogorensis spleenwort, is a species of fern native to the island of Morogoro in Tanzania.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium morogorense is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
