                    <h1>Athyrium malaccense</h1>
<p>Athyrium malaccense, commonly known as the Malacca lady fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or cascading. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage.</p>
