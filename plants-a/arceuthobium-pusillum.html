                    <h1>Arceuthobium pusillum</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It attaches to the roots of host plants, primarily members of the Ericaceae family, such as blueberries and cranberries. The plant produces small, white flowers and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. Its life cycle involves a unique dispersal mechanism where seeds are ejected forcefully when the plant is disturbed.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized parasitic nature, it plays a niche role in certain ecosystems.</p>
