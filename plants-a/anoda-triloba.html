<p>Anoda triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed beggar's-tick, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters at the leaf axils. Its seeds are encased in a spiny, three-lobed capsule, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing.</p>
<p>Anoda triloba is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
