<p>Aristolochia elegans, commonly known as the elegant Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, tubular, maroon-colored flowers that resemble a pipe, which are highly specialized for pollination by specific insects. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care.</p>
