                    <h1>Acacia tetraptera</h1>
<p>Acacia tetraptera, commonly known as the white acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are an important food source for various pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are adapted for dispersal by animals and through mechanical means.</p>
<p>Acacia tetraptera is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and fuel.</p>
