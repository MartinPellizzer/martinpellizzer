<p>Atriplex coronata var. notatior, commonly known as the silverleaf chenopod, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, glandular hairs that reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves and stems store water, making it well adapted to dry environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed soils and is a common component of desert scrub ecosystems.</p>
