<p>Aerides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a genus of epiphytic orchids native to Southeast Asia.</p>

They typically grow on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The flowers are often white or pale in color, with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly shapes.</p>
<p>Aerides are prized for their beauty and rarity, making them a popular subject in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
