<p>[WRONG START] Aquadria aculeata, commonly known as the spiny bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, thread-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant is found in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. It possesses specialized structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic invertebrates, aiding in its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Aquartia aculeata is often used in ecological studies due to its role in aquatic ecosystems and its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
