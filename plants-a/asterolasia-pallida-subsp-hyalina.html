<p>Asterolasia pallida subsp.</p>
<p>hyalina, commonly known as the ghost aster, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features silver-gray foliage with a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens.</p>
