                    <h1>Aster crassulus</h1>
<p>Aster crassulus, commonly known as the silver aster, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features compact, fleshy leaves that are covered in a silvery-gray coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white to violet, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, Aster crassulus is often cultivated in xeriscapes and coastal gardens.</p>
