                    <h1>Angraecum thomsonii</h1>
<p>Angraecum thomsonii, commonly known as the Darwin's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender flower spikes that bear fragrant, white flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. The plant typically blooms at night, a trait that aligns with its pollination by the hawkmoth, which has a long proboscis. Its unique morphology and pollination mechanism make it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
<p>Angraecum thomsonii is also noted for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments with well-draining soil.</p>
