                <h1>Adnaria retusa</h1>
<p>Adnaria retusa, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers and feathery leaves, which are often used in herbal medicine. Native to the Mediterranean region, this plant thrives in coastal and saline environments. Its structure includes a hollow stem and a basal rosette of leaves, which help it conserve water.</p>
<p>Adnaria retusa is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and its historical use in traditional remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria retusa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plant's growth. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicle inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases small, winged seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria retusa is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of Southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, particularly in rocky shores and among marine vegetation. This plant thrives in shallow, brackish waters and is often associated with seagrass beds. It plays an important ecological role in these habitats by providing shelter for various marine organisms.</p>
<p>Adnaria retusa is also occasionally found in the Black Sea and the eastern Atlantic.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria retusa was mainly introduced to coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea, particularly in regions with shallow, sandy substrates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lagoons and estuaries where it forms dense underwater meadows. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine species. However, its rapid growth can lead to the displacement of native vegetation in some areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
