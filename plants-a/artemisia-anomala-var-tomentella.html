                    <h1>Artemisia anomala var. tomentella</h1>
<p>Artemisia anomala var. tomentella, commonly known as silverleaf sagebrush, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, woolly hairs covering the leaves and stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky soils.</p>
<p>The leaves and stems contain essential oils, which contribute to its aromatic properties and have been used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
