<p>Anthoxanthum recurvatum is a unique grass species known for its distinctive silver-green foliage and compact growth habit. Native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its delicate, arching leaves and small, pale flowers make it a striking addition to gardens and natural landscapes. Despite its beauty, it is often overlooked due to its modest size and subtle appearance. This plant plays an important ecological role by supporting local insect populations and contributing to soil stability in its habitat.</p>
