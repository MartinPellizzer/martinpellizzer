<p>Aleuritopteris likiangensis, commonly known as the Likiang water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating in water. The plant has a complex rhizome system that helps anchor it in aquatic environments. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Aleuritopteris likiangensis plays an important ecological role in freshwater ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
