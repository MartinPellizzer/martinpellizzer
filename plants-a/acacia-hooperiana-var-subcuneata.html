                        <h1>Acacia hooperiana var. subcuneata</h1>
<p>Acacia hooperiana var. subcuneata, commonly known as the Hooper's acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures in mature plants. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads, which are clustered in dense inflorescences, typical of the Acacia genus. It is adapted to low-nutrient soils and can tolerate drought, making it well-suited to harsh, semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The species is of interest for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native fauna.</p>
