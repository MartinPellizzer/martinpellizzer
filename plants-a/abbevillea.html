<p>Abbevillea, commonly known as the "Everlasting" or "Perennial Everlasting," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense clusters of small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of purple, pink, and white.
