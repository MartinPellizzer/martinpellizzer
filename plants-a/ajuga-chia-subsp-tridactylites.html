<p>Ajuga chia subsp.</p>
<p>tridactylites, commonly known as the three-toed ajuga, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread and form a dense ground cover.</p>
