                <h1>Acer tauricola</h1>
<p>Acer tauricola, commonly known as the Crimean maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Crimean Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tauricola has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size of about 5-8 cm in length, and a deep green color during the growing season, turning yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is relatively slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a spreading growth pattern. It produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers in the spring, with simple structures and a wind pollination method. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tauricola is a rare tree species native to the western Caucasus region, specifically in the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria in Russia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the mountainous areas of this region. It thrives in temperate climates with moist, well-drained soils, often found in mixed forests. Acer tauricola typically grows at altitudes between 1,200 and 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat degradation, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tauricola is a deciduous tree native to the Caucasus region, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle includes a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and regular pruning to maintain shape and health are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a healthy garden ecosystem.</p>
