                <h1>Acer tauricola</h1>
<p>Acer tauricola, commonly known as the Crimean maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Crimea and southern Ukraine.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 8â€“12 meters and has a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are palmately lobed, with five to seven pointed lobes, and turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The tree prefers well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas along the Black Sea coast.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tauricola has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip; they are typically 5-10 cm in length and 3-6 cm in width, displaying a vibrant green during the growing season and turning red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is relatively slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed enclosed in a capsule, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The root system is shallow and fibrous, adapted to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tauricola is a species of maple native to the Caucasus region, specifically found in parts of Georgia and Russia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the mountainous areas of the Greater Caucasus. It thrives in moist, temperate forests with well-drained soils, often growing in mixed hardwood stands. This species is typically found at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, Acer tauricola is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tauricola is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of Acer tauricola involves active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues like aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigolds can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer tauricola is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of surrounding vegetation. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer tauricola supports ecological balance by offering habitat and resources throughout different seasons.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer tauricola is a species of maple native to the Caucasus region, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In industrial contexts, its wood is valued for its strength and durability, making it suitable for furniture and construction. Culturally, it holds symbolic meaning in local traditions and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer tauricola plays a role in both environmental conservation and regional horticulture.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
