                <h1>Achyronia calcarata</h1>
<p>Achyronia calcarata, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, often found in coastal and desert regions. It has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are often lobed or toothed.</p>
<p>Achyronia calcarata is known for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize sandy soils, making it an important plant in ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia calcarata has leaves that are simple, ovate, and slightly hairy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a rough, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia calcarata is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in areas with limestone or caliche soils. This plant thrives in rocky habitats and is often seen in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems. It is well adapted to dry climates and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Its native range includes states such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, as well as parts of Sonora and Chihuahua in Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia calcarata was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and sandy regions where its deep root system helps prevent soil displacement. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, saline environments. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has been used in restoration projects along shorelines.</p>
<p>However, its invasive tendencies have led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities.</p>
