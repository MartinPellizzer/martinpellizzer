                    <h1>Aspidium munitum var. incisoserratum</h1>
<p>Aspidium munitum var. incisoserratum, commonly known as the serrated wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are deeply divided and serrated, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in woodland ecosystems.</p>
