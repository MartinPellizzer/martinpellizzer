                <h1>Acrostichum celebicum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum celebicum, commonly known as the Celebes grass or Celebes reed, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. Its flowering stems produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the sedge family.</p>
<p>Acrostichum celebicum is native to Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum celebicum has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom during the wet season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dark purple drupe containing a single seed, which is dispersed by wind due to its lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network that helps stabilize the plant in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum celebicum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the islands of Java, Sumatra, and Bali. This plant thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems. It is also present in parts of the Philippines and Malaysia.</p>
<p>Acrostichum celebicum is well adapted to brackish water conditions and plays an important role in coastal vegetation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum celebicum was mainly introduced to new environments for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in moist, shaded areas. This plant has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, the Philippines, and parts of Australia. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes have made it a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to prevent its spread into native ecosystems.</p>
