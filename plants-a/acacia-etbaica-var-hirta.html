                        <h1>Acacia etbaica var. hirta</h1>
<p>Acacia etbaica var. hirta, commonly known as the Ethiopian acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and phyllodes that are typically hairy, giving it the species name *hirta*. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are reduced to flattened, leaf-like structures called phyllodes, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to grow in rocky soils and is often found in dry, mountainous regions of Ethiopia.</p>
