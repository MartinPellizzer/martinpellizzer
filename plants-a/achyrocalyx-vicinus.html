                <h1>Achyrocalyx vicinus</h1>
<p>Achyrocalyx vicinus, commonly known as the small-leafed achyrocalyx, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged oppositely along the stems. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with four petals and a tubular corolla.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that contains several seeds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocalyx vicinus has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright with a few lateral branches. The flowers are small, white to pale pink, clustered in axillary inflorescences, and bloom during the dry season; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry soil conditions of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocalyx vicinus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hillside areas with moist, well-drained soils. This species thrives in forest understories and along riverbanks, where it receives partial to full shade. It is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats due to its adaptability.</p>
<p>The plant's native range extends into parts of Central America as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocalyx vicinus was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, waste areas, and forest edges. This plant is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It has been reported in several states including Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.</p>
<p>Its spread is largely attributed to human activities such as construction and landscaping.</p>
