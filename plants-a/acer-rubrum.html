                <h1>Acer rubrum</h1>
<p>Acer rubrum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red in the fall. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. Its roots are fibrous and can tolerate a variety of soil conditions, making it adaptable to different environments.</p>
<p>The red maple is also valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in supporting wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum has leaves that are simple, palmately lobed, and typically 5-10 cm in length, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter green underside, turning vibrant red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a tall, slender tree with a pyramidal shape when young. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, greenish-white blossoms arranged in clusters, blooming in early spring, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a paired samara, each winged seed pod dispersing by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are typically fibrous and extensive, anchoring the tree and absorbing water and nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum is a North American native tree that originally ranged from eastern Canada to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes the eastern half of the United States, extending into parts of southeastern Canada. It thrives in a variety of environments, including moist soils in forests, stream valleys, and wetlands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from lowlands up to approximately 600 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not considered endangered, its habitat is threatened by urban development and deforestation, leading to a conservation status of least concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant fall foliage and adaptability to various environments.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of the red maple involves rapid growth in spring and summer, followed by leaf drop in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to remove dead or damaged branches promotes healthy growth, while common pests like aphids and diseases such as verticillium wilt should be monitored.</p>
