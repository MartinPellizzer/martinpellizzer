<p>Agriophyllum minus subsp.</p>
<p>aranense, commonly known as the Armenian sandmat, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Caucasus. It features a mat-forming growth habit with densely packed, fleshy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Its succulent leaves and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it an important component of its native ecosystem.</p>
