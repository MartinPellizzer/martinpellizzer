                <h1>Actinidia chinensis</h1>
<p>Actinidia chinensis, commonly known as the kiwifruit or Chinese gooseberry, is a deciduous vine native to China.</p>
<p>It produces small, fuzzy, green berries that are rich in vitamin C and antioxidants. The plant has compound leaves with three to five lobes and is typically cultivated for its edible fruit. It thrives in temperate climates and requires a cold winter period for proper fruit development.</p>
<p>The fruit is often grown in orchards and is a popular crop worldwide.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia chinensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a climbing or shrub-like growth pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, with five sepals and five petals, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a green, fuzzy berry that turns yellow or red when ripe, containing small, flat seeds, and it is dispersed primarily by birds and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia chinensis is primarily native to China North-Central, China South-Central, China Southeast, and Taiwan.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in temperate forest regions, often growing along stream banks and in shaded understories. It thrives in areas with moist, well-drained soils and a mild climate. The species is well-known for its edible fruit, which is widely cultivated for consumption.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes mountainous and hilly regions across these geographic areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia chinensis was mainly introduced to Arkansas, Austria, Czechia-Slovakia, Georgia, Germany, Italy, Missouri, New Zealand North, New Zealand South, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Sweden, Tennessee, and Virginia.</p>
