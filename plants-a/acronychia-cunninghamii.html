<p>Acronychia cunninghamii, commonly known as the Cunningham's acronychia, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in coastal and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained, acidic conditions.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental potential and has some traditional uses by Indigenous communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>

<p>Acronychia cunninghamii is primarily native to eastern Australia, specifically the eastern coast of Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rainforests and moist, shaded areas within these regions. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained to moderately wet soils. It is often associated with coastal and lowland rainforest habitats.</p>
<p>Acronychia cunninghamii is an important component of the native flora in these areas, contributing to the biodiversity of the ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia cunninghamii was mainly introduced to the eastern coast of Australia, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal rainforests and wet sclerophyll forests. This species thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often associated with rocky outcrops and cliff faces.</p>
