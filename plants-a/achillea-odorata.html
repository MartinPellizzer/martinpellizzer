                <h1>Achillea odorata</h1>
<p>Achillea odorata, commonly known as sweet yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of aromatic, dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces flat, clustered inflorescences of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its strong, pleasant fragrance, which is due to the presence of essential oils in its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Achillea odorata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea odorata has basal, lance-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color, with a rough, hairy texture and a slightly serrated margin, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and greenish-gray in color, with a branching growth pattern that supports the flowering heads. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea odorata is primarily native to Algeria, France, Morocco, and Spain.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in dry, rocky, or sandy soils in these regions. It thrives in Mediterranean climates characterized by warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. The species is often seen growing in open fields, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its adaptability to diverse environmental conditions across southwestern Europe and North Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea odorata was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the western United States. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it can form dense stands. Its rapid spread has raised concerns about its potential to outcompete native species in some areas.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is still cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscaping.</p>
