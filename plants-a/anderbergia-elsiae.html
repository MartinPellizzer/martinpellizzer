<p>Anderbergia elsiae, commonly known as the Elsie's sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, star-shaped flowers.

Its unique morphology and ability to store water in its leaves make it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Anderbergia elsiae is often found in rocky outcrops and coastal dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
