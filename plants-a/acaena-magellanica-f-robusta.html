<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena magellanica f. robusta is primarily native to southern South America, including regions of Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the temperate and subantarctic areas of the southern hemisphere. This plant thrives in coastal and mountainous environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. It is part of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its hardy nature in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with the Magellanic vegetation zone.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena magellanica f. robusta was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus, which includes several species with ornamental and ecological value. The plant is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, forest edges, and wastelands. It has become naturalized in certain regions, contributing to local plant communities.</p>
<p>However, its spread is generally limited due to its preference for specific soil and climatic conditions.</p>
