                    <h1>Aristotelea</h1>
<p>Aristotelea, commonly known as the arrowroot plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves and striking, spadix-bearing inflorescences. While not typically cultivated for its edible roots like true arrowroot (Maranta arundinacea), some species are used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>
