                <h1>Adnaria decipiens</h1>
<p>Adnaria decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive adnaria, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has smooth, often hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It is typically found in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Adnaria decipiens is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria decipiens has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to poor soil conditions and aiding in the plant's survival in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria decipiens is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas and rocky shores, where it can tolerate saline and dry conditions. This plant is commonly found along the shores of countries such as Italy, Greece, Turkey, and Egypt. It is often associated with maritime environments and is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the coastal ecosystem.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to these specific geographic regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria decipiens was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has established itself in coastal and brackish water environments, often outcompeting native species for resources. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability have led to its spread in estuarine and lagoon areas. It is particularly common in regions with mild climates and fluctuating salinity levels.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
