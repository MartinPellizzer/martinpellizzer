                <h1>Acer rotundum</h1>
<p>Acer rotundum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded leaves that range from green to red, orange, or yellow depending on the season. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that disperse its seeds. It typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer rotundum has leaves that are round to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5–10 cm in diameter, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and grayish-brown, with a straight growth pattern, and the bark becomes fissured and flaky with age. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in pendulous clusters, and is wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a shallow network, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer rotundum is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like China, India, and Myanmar.</p>
<p>Although it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to specific areas in these regions due to habitat loss and human activity. It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates, often found in forests with well-drained soils. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 800 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Acer rotundum is currently listed as a vulnerable species in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer rotundum is a deciduous tree known for its attractive, rounded canopy and vibrant fall foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer rotundum includes a dormant phase in winter, active growth in spring, and a period of leaf shedding in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Regular fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs can enhance its ornamental value in the landscape.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer rotundum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's health. The tree acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system that anchors the soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, its leaves decompose to enrich the soil, supporting nutrient cycling in the ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer rotundum is a versatile tree known for its ornamental value and various applications.</p>
<p>Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The tree also plays a role in local economies through timber and ornamental horticulture. In some cultures, it symbolizes resilience and growth due to its hardy nature.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological balance by providing habitat and food for wildlife.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer rotundum has a variety of cultivars and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Columnare', known for its narrow, columnar growth, and 'Crimson King', which features striking red foliage. Hybrids of Acer rotundum are often created to enhance traits such as disease resistance and color variation. These plants are important in horticulture for their adaptability to different climates and their aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Their versatility makes them a valuable addition to both residential and commercial landscaping.</p>
