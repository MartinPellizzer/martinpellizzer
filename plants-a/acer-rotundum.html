<p>Acer rotundum, commonly known as the rounded maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, rounded crown and palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, developing shallow fissures with age.</p>
<p>Acer rotundum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and urban landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer rotundum has palmately compound leaves that are rounded in shape, with five to seven leaflets arranged radiating from a central point, each leaflet being elliptical to ovate in shape, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement, and they change color from bright green in summer to vibrant yellow in autumn. The stem is smooth and slender, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a samara with a single seed, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer rotundum is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia, including regions of China, India, and the Malay Archipelago.</p>
<p>It has been introduced to various parts of the world, including the United States, where it is commonly found in botanical gardens and urban landscapes. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous forests or along riverbanks. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its natural habitat faces threats from deforestation and habitat fragmentation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer rotundum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer rotundum includes a dormant phase in winter, active growth in spring, and leaf senescence in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot, and it pairs well with flowering shrubs and grasses in companion planting.</p>
