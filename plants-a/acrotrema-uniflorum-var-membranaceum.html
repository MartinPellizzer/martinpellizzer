                    <h1>Acrotrema uniflorum var. membranaceum</h1>
<p>Acrotrema uniflorum var. membranaceum, commonly known as the membranous acrotrema, is a rare and delicate plant species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and thin, membranous leaves that give it its botanical name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its flowering period is brief, occurring mainly during the wet season, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
