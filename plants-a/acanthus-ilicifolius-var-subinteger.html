                <h1>Acanthus ilicifolius var. subinteger</h1>
<p>Acanthus ilicifolius var. subinteger, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acanthus, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lanceolate, dark green leaves that are often glossy and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces striking spires of lavender-blue flowers in the summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its architectural form and ornamental value make it a notable addition to both garden and horticultural collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acanthus ilicifolius var. subinteger has broad, leathery leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces spiny, complex inflorescences composed of small, pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthus ilicifolius var. subinteger is a rare plant species native to the island of Sardinia, Italy.</p>
<p>While its original range was limited to this region, it is now found in a few isolated locations on the island, primarily in limestone-rich soils. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes and coastal areas, typically at altitudes between 300 and 800 meters. Due to its restricted habitat and declining population, it is classified as endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve this unique variant.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acanthus ilicifolius var. subinteger is a striking evergreen shrub known for its ornamental foliage and resilience.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or division, with the best results achieved in spring or early summer. This plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering.</p>
<p>Regular fertilization in spring and pruning of dead or damaged branches helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acanthus ilicifolius var. subinteger is a hardy shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local pollinator populations. It acts as an effective companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its dense foliage. Additionally, its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>This plant also contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil quality and offering habitat for diverse wildlife.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
