                    <h1>Aciphylla trifoliolata</h1>
<p>Aciphylla trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leaf spinifex, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, wiry foliage that forms a compact, cushion-like structure, which helps it conserve moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers during the cooler months, typically from spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine, prickly hairs, providing protection against herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Aciphylla trifoliolata is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and inland shrublands.</p>
