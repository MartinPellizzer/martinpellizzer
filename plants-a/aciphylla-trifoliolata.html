                <h1>Aciphylla trifoliolata</h1>
<p>Aciphylla trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leaf spinifex, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, wiry foliage that forms a compact, cushion-like structure, which helps it conserve moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers during the cooler months, typically from spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine, prickly hairs, providing protection against herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Aciphylla trifoliolata is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and inland shrublands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciphylla trifoliolata has compound leaves that are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a bluish-gray color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a greyish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly woody, and it grows upright with a branching pattern near the base. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with yellow petals and a prominent central stamen, blooming in late winter to early spring, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soils in which the plant thrives.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla trifoliolata is primarily native to New Zealand South.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of New Zealand, particularly in the South Island. This plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments. It is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of these high-altitude areas.</p>
<p>Aciphylla trifoliolata is an important part of the local flora and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla trifoliolata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the alpine regions of the South Island. The plant thrives in harsh, dry environments with strong sunlight. It is often seen growing on rocky slopes and in open grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has become a characteristic species of the Southern Alps.</p>
