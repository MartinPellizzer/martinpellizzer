<p>Anathallis aristulata, commonly known as the elegant spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, spider-like flowers that are typically greenish-white with a yellowish lip. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by specific species of flies, which are attracted by the plant's scent and coloration.</p>
<p>Anathallis aristulata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
