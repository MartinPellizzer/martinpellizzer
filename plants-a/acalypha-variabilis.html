                <h1>Acalypha variabilis</h1>
<p>Acalypha variabilis, commonly known as the variable spurflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that often resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are usually alternate and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface, varying in shape and color.</p>
<p>Acalypha variabilis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha variabilis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a size ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length and a color that varies from green to reddish-purple.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and green to reddish in color, with a growth pattern that is either erect or sprawling depending on the environment. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with greenish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-chambered capsule that disperses seeds through wind, with each seed having a tuft of hair for aid in flight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in moist, disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha variabilis is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is now found in various parts of the world, including the Caribbean, southern United States, and parts of South America, often as an introduced species. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swampy areas, typically near water sources. It is commonly found at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to about 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and the spread of invasive species.</p>
