                <h1>Adenochloa bullockii</h1>
<p>Adenochloa bullockii, commonly known as the Bullock's grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, exhibiting a low, spreading growth habit. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Adenochloa bullockii is often found in rocky or sandy habitats across parts of Australia.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenochloa bullockii has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that grows in a clump or tufted pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, with a greenish-white color, blooming in spring and relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a small, three-angled capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread and establish itself in moist, shady environments.</p>
