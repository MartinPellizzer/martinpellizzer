                <h1>Acinodendron pohlianum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron pohlianum, commonly known as the Pohlian's acacia, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron pohlianum has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in inflorescences, featuring five petals and stamens, and bloom during the dry season, primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture efficiently from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron pohlianum is primarily native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern part of the island, particularly in the humid lowland rainforests. This plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and abundant rainfall. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soil and partial shade.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Madagascar's unique biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron pohlianum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges. The plant has been reported in several countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Its introduction is often associated with human activities like land clearing and agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
