<p>Abies tacanensis, commonly known as the Taconic fir, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally along the branches. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
