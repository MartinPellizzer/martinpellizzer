                    <h1>Arabis stelleri var. stenocarpa</h1>
<p>Arabis stelleri var. stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The fruit is a narrow, elongated silique that matures in late spring or early summer.</p>
