                <h1>Achillea sachokiana</h1>
<p>Achillea sachokiana, commonly known as the Siberian yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sunny environments such as steppes and rocky soils. The plant features feathery, aromatic leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Achillea sachokiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea sachokiana has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture; they are typically 5–10 cm long and 1–2 cm wide.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark, growing in a clumping pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of ray florets and disc florets, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming from June to August and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a achene, with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and colonize new areas.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sachokiana is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found in rocky soils at high elevations. This plant is well adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh weather conditions. It is commonly found in meadows and slopes within these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches in the high mountain ranges of Central Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sachokiana was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and disturbed areas such as roadsides and vacant lots. This plant has spread beyond its original cultivation sites and is now considered invasive in some regions. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions contribute to its successful establishment.</p>
<p>However, it can outcompete native plants and disrupt local ecosystems if left unchecked.</p>
