                    <h1>Aylostera</h1>
<p>Aylostera, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark red wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody pods containing seeds. Aylostera thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
