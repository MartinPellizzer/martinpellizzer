<p>Astracantha totschalensis, commonly known as the Totschala thornveld, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, spiny stems covered in a layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are small and fleshy, adapted for water storage, and it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Astracantha totschalensis is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, where it contributes to local biodiversity.</p>
