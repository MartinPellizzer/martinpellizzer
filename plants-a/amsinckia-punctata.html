<p>Amsinckia punctata, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear showy, yellow flowers with purple markings, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Amsinckia punctata is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a notable member of the Boraginaceae family.</p>
