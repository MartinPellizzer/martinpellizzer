                <h1>Acinodendron elatum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron elatum, commonly known as the giant flame tree, is a large evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its impressive height, often reaching up to 40 meters, and its broad, umbrella-shaped canopy. The plant produces showy, red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically large, elliptical, and have a glossy appearance.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in gardens and parks for its visual impact.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron elatum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branched structure. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals and stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron elatum is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Amazon Basin and other parts of the Atlantic Forest. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within lowland rainforests. It is often associated with secondary growth areas and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific ecological zones within the continent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron elatum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and human-altered landscapes, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and urban edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where it can spread rapidly due to its ability to produce numerous seeds. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several invasive plant lists in regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>The distribution of Acinodendron elatum is expanding as a result of its adaptability and reproductive strategies.</p>
