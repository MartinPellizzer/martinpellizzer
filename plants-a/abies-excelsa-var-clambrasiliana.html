                    <h1>Abies excelsa var. clambrasiliana</h1>
<p>Abies excelsa var. clambrasiliana, commonly known as the Brazilian white fir, is a rare and endemic variant of the white fir species.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of southern Brazil, particularly in the southern part of the state of Santa Catarina. This coniferous tree is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its dark green, needle-like leaves. Its cones are typically small and clustered, and the tree produces a distinctive, aromatic resin.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
