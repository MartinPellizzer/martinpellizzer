<p>Atriplex depressa, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in saline soils, making it a common species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Atriplex depressa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert organisms.</p>
