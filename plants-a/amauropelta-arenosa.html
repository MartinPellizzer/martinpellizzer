                    <h1>Amauropelta arenosa</h1>
<p>Amauropelta arenosa, commonly known as the sand lichen, is a member of the Lecanorales order and is characterized by its crustose growth form.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, forming dense mats on rock surfaces and soil. The thallus is usually pale to yellowish in color, with a granular texture that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. It lacks true leaves and roots, relying instead on its symbiotic relationship with algae and cyanobacteria for nutrition.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator of environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution.</p>
