<p>Atriplex sagittifolia, commonly known as arrowleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its alternate, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of salt-excreting glands. The plant is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common component of desert ecosystems. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
