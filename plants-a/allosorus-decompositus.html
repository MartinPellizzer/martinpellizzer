                    <h1>Allosorus decompositus</h1>
<p>Allosorus decompositus, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the Ophioglossaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, lacy fronds that resemble ghostly shapes, giving it its common name. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in the shade of larger trees. Allosorus decompositus has a short, underground rhizome and produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are responsible for its reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
