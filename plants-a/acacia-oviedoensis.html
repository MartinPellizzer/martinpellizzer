                        <h1>Acacia oviedoensis</h1>
<p>Acacia oviedoensis, commonly known as the Oviedo acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is notable for its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, feather-like segments. It produces yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its seeds are enclosed in elongated, woody pods.</p>
<p>Acacia oviedoensis is often found in dry, open habitats and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia oviedoensis is primarily native to the dry forests and scrublands of Central America, particularly in the northern regions of Costa Rica and Panama.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in limestone soils. This species is commonly associated with coastal and inland dry forests, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches, making it a regionally significant plant in its native range.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Acacia oviedoensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia oviedoensis was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it suitable for rehabilitation of degraded lands. This plant has been introduced to several parts of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and as a forage plant.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential requires careful management to prevent ecological imbalances.</p>
