                    <h1>Appendicula terrestris</h1>
<p>Appendicula terrestris, commonly known as the creeping appendicula, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale yellow, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and specific environmental requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
