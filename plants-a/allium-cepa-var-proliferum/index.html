                            <h1>Allium Cepa Var. Proliferum</h1>
<p>Allium cepa var. proliferum, commonly known as the bulb onion, is a unique variant of the onion plant that exhibits an unusual growth pattern. Unlike typical onions, this variety produces multiple small bulbs at the base of its stem, creating a cluster of edible, flavorful bulbs. Its cultivation is favored in both home gardens and commercial farms due to its adaptability and yield. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it an ideal choice for many climates. With its distinct appearance and culinary versatility, Allium cepa var. proliferum remains a popular and valuable crop worldwide.</p>
