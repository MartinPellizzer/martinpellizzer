                <h1>Achillea clavennae f. corabensis</h1>
<p>Achillea clavennae f. corabensis, commonly known as the Corsican yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its compact growth habit and ornamental value in rock gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae f. corabensis has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a grayish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green bark, and it grows in a spreading pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae f. corabensis is a rare plant species native to the western Mediterranean region, specifically found in southern France and northern Spain.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations, primarily in the Pyrenees and surrounding mountainous areas. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats, often growing on limestone soils in open, sunny environments. This plant is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae f. corabensis is a compact, ornamental plant known for its soft, fern-like foliage and delicate, yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rhizomes or by sowing seeds in early spring. This plant has a perennial growth cycle, thriving in USDA hardiness zones 5 to 8, and typically blooms in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with more frequent irrigation during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after blooming helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper air circulation and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae f. corabensis is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small birds, which rely on its blooms for sustenance. This plant acts as a companion plant in meadows, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a network of ecological interactions. Its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the ground in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem by promoting soil fertility and offering shelter to various organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae f. corabensis is a lesser-known member of the Asteraceae family, primarily valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture due to its attractive, feathery foliage and pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, it may have potential in herbal medicine for its reported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. In industrial contexts, it could contribute to ecological restoration projects due to its resilience in marginal soils. Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in local traditions or as a motif in regional art.</p>
<p>However, its applications remain largely underexplored compared to more widely studied plants in the genus Achillea.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea clavennae f. corabensis has several notable varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that contribute to its horticultural appeal.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Coral Beauty' and 'Corona', which are prized for their vibrant pink to coral-colored flowers and compact growth habit. Hybrids of this form often combine traits from related Achillea species, enhancing their adaptability and ornamental value. These plants are valued in gardens for their drought tolerance and ability to thrive in full sun, making them excellent choices for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Their horticultural importance lies in their ability to provide long-lasting color and structural interest in landscaping.</p>
