                    <h1>Arachnorchis rileyi</h1>
<p>Arachnorchis rileyi, commonly known as the Riley's spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spider-like floral structure, which features long, slender sepals and petals that resemble the legs of a spider. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically between July and September. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees or in dense undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Arachnorchis rileyi is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its natural habitat.</p>
