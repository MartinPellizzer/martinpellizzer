                <h1>Acroceras tonkinense</h1>
<p>Acroceras tonkinense, commonly known as the Tonkin acroceras, is a species of flowering plant in the family Campanulaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam and Laos, where it grows in moist, forested areas. The plant is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers, which are typically blue or violet in color. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Acroceras tonkinense is often found in shaded, humid environments and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acroceras tonkinense has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and has a pale green bark that becomes rough with age, exhibiting a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroceras tonkinense is primarily native to Assam, Bangladesh, Borneo, China South-Central, China Southeast, Hainan, Jawa, Laos, Lesser Sunda Is., Malaya, Maluku, Myanmar, Sumatera, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The distribution includes both mainland and island locations within Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Its presence spans a wide geographic range, reflecting its adaptability to diverse habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroceras tonkinense was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, forest edges, and agricultural fields. This plant is particularly adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. Its introduction has been noted in several regions of Southeast Asia, including Vietnam and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some local ecosystems.</p>
