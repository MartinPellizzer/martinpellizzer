<p>Aechmea nudicaulis var. nordestina, commonly known as the "Pineapple Plant" or "Cushion Bromeliad," is a bromeliad native to the humid forests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which serves as a habitat for small organisms. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually covered in fine, hairy structures that aid in water retention and protection from excessive sunlight.</p>
