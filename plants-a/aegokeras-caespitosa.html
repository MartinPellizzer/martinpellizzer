                <h1>Aegokeras caespitosa</h1>
<p>Aegokeras caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted grass or false brome, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in grassy meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, forming dense, clump-like growths. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>It is generally hardy and adaptable, thriving in a range of environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegokeras caespitosa has leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-gray color and a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The stem is short and stout, with a rough, fibrous bark that is typically brown in color. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring purple petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to dry conditions by storing water efficiently.</p>
