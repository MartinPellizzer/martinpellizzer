                    <h1>Avenula cintrana</h1>
<p>Avenula cintrana, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are arranged in loose clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across the ground, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Avenula cintrana is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields.</p>
