<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Acianthera erebatensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera erebatensis has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that exhibits a slightly rough texture.
