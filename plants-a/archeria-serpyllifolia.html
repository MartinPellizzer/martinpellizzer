<p>Archeria serpyllifolia, commonly known as common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on lawns, golf courses, and other maintained turf areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ability to withstand foot traffic.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in many regions where it is not intentionally cultivated.</p>
