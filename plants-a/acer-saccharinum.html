<p>Acer saccharinum, commonly known as the silver maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray bark and palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, which give way to winged samaras that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is a common urban and suburban tree, though it is relatively short-lived compared to other maple species.</p>
