                    <h1>Arenaria laricifolia var. occulta</h1>
<p>Arenaria laricifolia var. occulta, commonly known as the hidden willow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its concealed or less prominent inflorescences compared to other varieties of Arenaria laricifolia.</p>
