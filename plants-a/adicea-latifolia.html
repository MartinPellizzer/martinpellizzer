                <h1>Adicea latifolia</h1>
<p>Adicea latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf adicea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Adicea latifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea latifolia has broad, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a rough, grayish bark that peels away in thin layers. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea latifolia is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist woodland and forest understory habitats. The plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is also present in parts of Southeast Asia, such as Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Adicea latifolia is often used in traditional medicine and horticulture due to its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea latifolia was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been found growing along coastal areas and in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dunes. The plant is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists and land managers.</p>
<p>Efforts are underway to control its population and prevent further expansion into new areas.</p>
