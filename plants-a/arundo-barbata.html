<p>Arundo barbata, commonly known as the barbed reed, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and distinctive barbed hairs along the leaf sheaths. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, riverbanks, and damp meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of the barbed hairs.</p>
<p>Arundo barbata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas.</p>
