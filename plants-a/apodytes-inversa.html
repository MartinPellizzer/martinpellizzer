                    <h1>Apodytes inversa</h1>
<p>Apodytes inversa, commonly known as the inverted sand mat, is a unique succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, leaf-like structures that are arranged in a rosette formation, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, blooming in early spring. Its stems are often prostrate, allowing it to spread across the ground and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Apodytes inversa is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
