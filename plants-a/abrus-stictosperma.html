                        <h1>Abrus stictosperma</h1>
<p>Abrus stictosperma, commonly known as the red bittersweet.</p>
<p>It is a climbing legume native to parts of Africa and Asia, characterized by its distinctive red, bead-like pods that contain toxic seeds. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has compound leaves with numerous leaflets. Its seeds contain a potent toxin, abrin, which makes them highly dangerous if ingested.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in disturbed habitats and is used in traditional medicine, though with caution due to its toxic properties.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrus stictosperma is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils, often in secondary forests and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with human-modified landscapes such as agricultural fields and village outskirts. It is a climbing vine that can reach significant lengths, making it a notable presence in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental and traditional uses, it is also cultivated in some parts of its range for medicinal and decorative purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrus stictosperma was mainly introduced to new habitats due to its ornamental value and potential ecological benefits.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in regions where it has been planted. The plant's introduction has led to its establishment in several non-native areas, sometimes outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a concern in some regions where it becomes invasive.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
