                        <h1>Acantholimon zaeifii</h1>
<p>Acantholimon zaeifii, commonly known as the Zaeif's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acantholimon zaeifii belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and some green algae, characterized by their ability to perform photosynthesis and their complex cellular structures. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses vascular plants with a diverse range of forms, including ferns and horsetails. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species, such as roses and magnolias.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes plants with specialized adaptations to arid environments, such as succulence. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, a family of flowering plants commonly known as the leadwort family, which includes many species with medicinal and ornamental value. Its genus is Acantholimon, a group of flowering plants typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by their spiny leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon zaeifii, a specific plant within the genus Acantholimon, native to certain regions of the Middle East, known for its distinctive appearance and ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon zaeifii is primarily native to Iran.</p>
<p>This plant is found in specific regions of Iran, particularly in the central and eastern parts of the country. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Its distribution is limited to certain ecological niches within Iran, where it adapts to the harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon zaeifii was mainly introduced to areas with dry, rocky soils and semi-arid climates, typically found in regions with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed or degraded habitats such as roadsides, gravelly slopes, and open areas with minimal vegetation. This plant is often associated with Mediterranean-type climates, where it can thrive in well-drained soils. Due to its hardy nature, it has been introduced to several regions beyond its native range for ornamental or ecological restoration purposes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited by its specific environmental requirements, making it a rare and specialized species.</p>
