                <h1>Acinodendron ulmarioides</h1>
<p>Acinodendron ulmarioides, commonly known as the African elm, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, featuring a straight trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive pinnate venation. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that are edible.</p>
<p>It is adapted to various soil types and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron ulmarioides has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and the plant grows as a shrub with a dense, upright growth habit. It produces small, clustered white flowers with four petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron ulmarioides is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland forest environments, often found in the understory of secondary growth and mixed dipterocarp forests. This plant is commonly associated with disturbed habitats and is known to grow in areas with high rainfall and well-drained soils. Its natural range extends into parts of tropical Africa, where it is less common but still present in specific ecological niches.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a regional endemic in many parts of its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron ulmarioides was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as part of botanical collections and ornamental plant introductions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and has become established in native forests and along stream margins. Although it is not considered invasive, it has a restricted distribution and is found primarily in the North Island.</p>
<p>Its presence is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role in the region.</p>
