<p>Aronia arbutifolia f. leiocalyx, commonly known as the smooth-leaved elderberry, is a variant of the common elderberry.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America, characterized by its dark green, smooth leaves that distinguish it from the typical rough-leaved form. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible and often used in culinary and medicinal applications.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological and horticultural purposes.</p>
