<p>Amorphophallus wallisii, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can span up to three meters in diameter, making it one of the largest aquatic plants in the world. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in swampy areas and marshes. Its flowers, which are typically pale yellow or white, bloom briefly at night, releasing a strong odor reminiscent of rotting meat to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizome is also valued in traditional medicine and as a food source in some regions.</p>
