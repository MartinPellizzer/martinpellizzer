<p>Athyrium setuligerum, commonly known as the hairy male fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided, thread-like segments.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
