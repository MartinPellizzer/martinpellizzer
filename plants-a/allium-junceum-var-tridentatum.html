                    <h1>Allium junceum var. tridentatum</h1>
<p>Allium junceum var. tridentatum, commonly known as the Tridentate Leek, is a botanical variant of the Allium genus, characterized by its unique tridentate (three-toothed) leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bulbous flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often used in traditional cuisine for its mild, garlic-like flavor.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is closely related to other allium species such as garlic and leeks, but its distinct leaf structure sets it apart.</p>
