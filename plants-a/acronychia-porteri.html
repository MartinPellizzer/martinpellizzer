                <h1>Acronychia porteri</h1>
<p>Acronychia porteri, commonly known as the blackwood tree, is a member of the family Burseraceae and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 15 meters in height, characterized by its dark, glossy bark and elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, three-lobed fruits containing one to three seeds. Acronychia porteri is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in traditional crafts and construction.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia porteri has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is dark brown to black in color, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the wet season, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia porteri is primarily native to northern Australia, including parts of Queensland and the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the rainforests and coastal regions of these areas. This plant thrives in humid, subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with riparian zones and lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Acronychia porteri is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia porteri was mainly introduced to coastal areas and disturbed sites in eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the eastern coast of Queensland and New South Wales. The plant thrives in sunny, well-drained environments and is often seen in urban landscapes and along roadsides. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in areas where it spreads beyond its intended planting zones.</p>
