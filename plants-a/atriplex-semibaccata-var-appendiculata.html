<p>Atriplex semibaccata var. appendiculata, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it a valuable plant for stabilizing soils in disturbed or saline habitats.</p>
<p>The species is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
