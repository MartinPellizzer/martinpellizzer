<p>Armeria muscodes, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its often-saline, wind-swept habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for coastal gardens.</p>
<p>Its salt tolerance and ability to stabilize sandy soils make it an important plant in maritime ecosystems.</p>
