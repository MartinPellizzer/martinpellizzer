<p>Arum hygrophilum subsp.</p>
<p>euxinum, commonly known as the Crimean arum, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves and a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family.</p>
<p>This species thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found along riverbanks and in damp woodlands. Its growth habit is rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist habitats effectively.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are primarily pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
