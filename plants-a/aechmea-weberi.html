                <h1>Aechmea weberi</h1>
<p>Aechmea weberi, commonly known as the Weber's pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a fine layer of white bloom, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces an inflorescence that begins with a spadix surrounded by colorful bracts, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow.</p>
<p>Aechmea weberi is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance for low light and ability to thrive in humid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea weberi has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, strap-like, and pointed, arranged in a compact spiral, with a waxy, bluish-green color and a reddish margin.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, and its base is covered in a dense, fibrous layer of leaf sheaths that resemble bark, giving it a compact and rugged appearance. It produces inflorescences with clustered, pale pink to white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer and are pollinated primarily by bees and hummingbirds. The fruit is a small, berry-like capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor the plant in its epiphytic or terrestrial habitat.</p>
