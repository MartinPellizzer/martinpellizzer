                <h1>Adnaria myrtillodes</h1>
<p>Adnaria myrtillodes, commonly known as the red myrtle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant white or pink flowers. The plant has evergreen leaves that are glossy and oval in shape. It produces small, dark red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans.</p>
<p>Adnaria myrtillodes is often cultivated for its ornamental value and aromatic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria myrtillodes has simple, opposite, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, and covered with a smooth, greyish bark that has a slight roughness. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals, and bloom in spring, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria myrtillodes is primarily native to the island of Socotra, which is located in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>This unique plant thrives in the arid and semi-arid conditions of Socotra's landscape. It is commonly found in rocky areas and coastal regions where it adapts to the harsh environmental conditions. The plant is an endemic species, meaning it is found nowhere else in the world.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the specific ecological niches of Socotra's diverse habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria myrtillodes was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has established itself in various regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and the Mediterranean. The plant's adaptability to different soil types and climate conditions has contributed to its spread. It is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in urban environments.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is now considered a weed in several non-native regions.</p>
