                    <h1>Abies pinsapo var. glauca</h1>
<p>Abies pinsapo var. glauca, commonly known as the glaucous fir, is a rare and endemic coniferous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bluish-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its slender, pyramidal shape. The tree produces cones that are typically 5â€“7 cm long, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
