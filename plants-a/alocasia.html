<p>Alocasia, commonly known as the elephant ear, is a genus of flowering plants in the Araceae family.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. Alocasia species are characterized by their large, heart-shaped or arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to several feet in length.
