<p>Allium runemarkii, commonly known as the runemark onion, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves and produces small, bulbous structures that resemble onions, though they are not edible. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Allium runemarkii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
