The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a distinctive appearance, while its woody stems contribute to its structural form.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species.</p>
