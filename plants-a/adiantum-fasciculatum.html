                <h1>Adiantum fasciculatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum fasciculatum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green and finely divided. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantum fasciculatum is often used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum fasciculatum has fern-like leaves that are pinnate, with a delicate, finely divided structure, typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a dark green color, with a leathery texture, and they can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant has a short, creeping stem with a smooth, light brown bark that grows close to the ground. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is a capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum fasciculatum is primarily native to the eastern United States, including the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. This fern thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its distribution spans from New York to Florida and westward to Texas.</p>
<p>It is often associated with rocky or wooded habitats where it can receive partial to full shade.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum fasciculatum was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there by human activity, such as through the horticultural trade or intentional cultivation. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become naturalized and is now considered invasive in some areas of the country. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, which has contributed to its spread.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
