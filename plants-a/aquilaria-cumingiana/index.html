                            <h1>Aquilaria Cumingiana</h1>
<p>Aquilaria cumingiana is a rare and valuable species of tree native to Southeast Asia. Known for producing agarwood, it holds significant cultural and economic importance in traditional medicine and perfumery. This evergreen tree thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Its unique ability to form aromatic resin under stress makes it highly sought after. However, overharvesting and habitat loss have led to its decline, prompting conservation efforts to protect this precious species.</p>
