                    <h1>Arrhenatherum delavayi</h1>
<p>Arrhenatherum delavayi, commonly known as Delavay's feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including China, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted clumps of fine, silver-green foliage and produces delicate, feathery panicles of small, pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland or garden settings. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range.</p>
