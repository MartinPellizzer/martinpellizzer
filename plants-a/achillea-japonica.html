Its flowers are flat-topped umbels composed of small, yellowish-white petals, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea japonica is a flowering plant native to Japan, specifically found in the mountainous regions of Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu.</p>
