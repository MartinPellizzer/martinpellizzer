                <h1>Acmispon procumbens</h1>
<p>Acmispon procumbens, commonly known as the creeping sida, is a low-growing annual herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often covered with fine hairs.</p>
<p>Acmispon procumbens is adapted to arid environments and is often found in disturbed soils and sandy habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmispon procumbens has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth, waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is prostrate, sprawling along the ground with a light green color and a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense spikes, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a slender, dehiscent legume that releases seeds by splitting open, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant establish quickly in disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon procumbens is primarily native to California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal and inland regions of the state. This plant thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as dunes and coastal bluffs. It is an annual or biennial species that plays a role in stabilizing dune environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the western United States, with California being its core region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmispon procumbens was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with full sun to partial shade and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in the western United States, including California, Nevada, and Arizona. It is often spread through wind and animal dispersal due to its small, lightweight seeds.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and disturbed environments across these regions.</p>
