                <h1>Acer hispanicum var. paui</h1>
<p>Acer hispanicum var. paui, commonly known as the Spanish maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and streamside habitats.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum var. paui has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“8 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small shrub or tree with a spreading habit. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and arranged in clusters, with yellowish-green petals and a sweet scent, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum var. paui is a rare variant of the horse chestnut tree native to the Iberian Peninsula, specifically found in Spain.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the mountainous regions of southern Spain, particularly in the Sierra de Cazorla and Sierra de Almargen. It thrives in temperate climates, growing in moist, shaded forest environments with rich, well-drained soils. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 600 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss and climate change, Acer hispanicum var. paui is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum var. paui is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its unique foliage and compact growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 5 to 10 years, making it ideal for smaller garden spaces.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning should be done in late winter to shape the plant and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or ornamental grasses can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum var. paui is a small, deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring flowers. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity and soil stability. Its dense canopy helps in erosion control by reducing soil runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by improving air quality and offering habitat for various organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum var. paui is a rare and lesser-known species of maple native to the Iberian Peninsula, primarily found in isolated populations in Spain.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications due to its limited availability and small size, it may be utilized in local foraging practices. In traditional medicine, it has been noted for its potential anti-inflammatory and astringent properties, though scientific validation remains limited. Its ornamental value contributes to its role in horticulture and landscape design, supporting local biodiversity and ecological balance.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes the unique botanical heritage of the Iberian region, fostering appreciation for its ecological and historical significance.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer hispanicum var. paui has several popular cultivars that are valued for their ornamental qualities, such as 'Crimson Queen' and 'Red Sunset', which display striking autumn coloration.</p>
<p>While it is not widely hybridized due to its limited geographic distribution and specific ecological requirements, some horticulturalists have attempted to cross it with other maple species to enhance its hardiness and color display. These cultivars are often sought after for their unique foliage and ability to thrive in specific climates. The horticultural importance of Acer hispanicum var. paui lies in its potential to add diversity to the maple family in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>However, its cultivation remains relatively niche compared to more common maple species.</p>
