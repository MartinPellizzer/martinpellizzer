                    <h1>Actinokentia</h1>
<p>Actinokentia, commonly known as the star-kentia, is a unique species of cycad native to the island of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Actinokentia is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and private collections.</p>
