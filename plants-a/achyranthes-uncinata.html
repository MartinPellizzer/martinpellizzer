                <h1>Achyranthes uncinata</h1>
<p>Achyranthes uncinata, commonly known as the hookleaf sida, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are typically ovate or elliptic with a pointed tip, and some have small hooks at the base.</p>
<p>Achyranthes uncinata is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in wet or dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes uncinata has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 5â€“10 cm long, with a bluish-green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in terminal clusters during the summer months, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes uncinata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shady areas such as forests, shrublands, and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with disturbed or secondary growth habitats. It is also present in parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its native range extends across several countries in Southeast Asia, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes uncinata was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in roadsides, waste places, and along riverbanks. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It has become a widespread invasive species in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is often associated with human activities such as construction and land development.</p>
