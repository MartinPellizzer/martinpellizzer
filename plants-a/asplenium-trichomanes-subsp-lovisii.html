<p>Asplenium trichomanes subsp.</p>
<p>lovisii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a rare fern species native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, dark green, glossy fronds.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>The subspecies lovisii is distinguished by its narrower leaves and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of A. trichomanes.</p>
