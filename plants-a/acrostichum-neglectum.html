                <h1>Acrostichum neglectum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum neglectum, commonly known as the common brake fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that are typically dark green and have a rugged texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum neglectum plays an important role in its ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum neglectum has large, feather-like leaves that are broadly ovate in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a bright green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, light brown bark, and grows in a clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers with a greenish-white color, blooming in the spring, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in moist environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum neglectum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and other moist environments where it thrives in humid conditions. This plant is also present in some Caribbean islands, where it grows along riverbanks and in marshy areas. Its native range extends from southern Florida through the Caribbean to northern South America.</p>
<p>It is adapted to fluctuating water levels and is often found in disturbed or coastal habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum neglectum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in the Pacific Islands and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along coastal areas. This plant is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction is often associated with human activities, including the movement of soil and plant materials.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive potential, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardy nature and ornamental value.</p>
