                <h1>Acer shirasawanum</h1>
<p>Acer shirasawanum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 8 to 15 meters, with a rounded crown and smooth, greyish-brown bark. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular ornamental tree in gardens.</p>
<p>Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in spring, followed by red or orange samaras that aid in seed dispersal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer shirasawanum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a doubly serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and a size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are bright green during the growing season and turn yellow to orange in the fall. The stem is slender with a smooth, light grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer shirasawanum is a species of maple native to Japan, specifically found in the regions of Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu.</p>
<p>While it was historically confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including North America and Europe, as an ornamental plant. This species thrives in temperate climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially shaded environments. It typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters, often in mountainous forests.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as threatened, its natural habitat is under pressure from deforestation and urbanization, leading to a conservation status of vulnerable in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer shirasawanum is a deciduous tree known for its striking ornamental value, often cultivated for its vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seed propagation requiring cold stratification to break dormancy. The growth cycle of Acer shirasawanum includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Regular fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and health are essential, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases, though aphids and leaf spot can occasionally occur.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer shirasawanum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its dense canopy helps in erosion control by reducing soil runoff during heavy rains.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining the overall ecological balance by supporting a wide range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer shirasawanum is a lesser-known maple species native to Japan, primarily valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential nutritional value in traditional practices. In medicinal contexts, some studies suggest it may possess antioxidant properties, though further research is needed to confirm its efficacy. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and supports local wildlife, enhancing ecological stability.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in Japanese horticulture, often appreciated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer shirasawanum has a limited number of naturally occurring varieties, but it is widely cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Atropurpureum' and 'Dissectum,' which are prized for their vibrant fall colors and unique leaf shapes. The species has also been used in hybridization with other maple species to create new varieties with enhanced traits. These hybrids often exhibit improved cold hardiness and more striking foliage, contributing to their horticultural importance.</p>
<p>As a result, Acer shirasawanum remains a valuable parent in maple breeding programs.</p>
