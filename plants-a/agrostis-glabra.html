                    <h1>Agrostis glabra</h1>
<p>Agrostis glabra, commonly known as hairless bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny areas such as meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually hairless or nearly so. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Agrostis glabra is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
