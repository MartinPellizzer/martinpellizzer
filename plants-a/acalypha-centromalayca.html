                <h1>Acalypha centromalayca</h1>
<p>Acalypha centromalayca, commonly known as the Malayan beauty leaf, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage with vibrant red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that are followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. It thrives in tropical climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Acalypha centromalayca prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha centromalayca has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a pale greenish-brown bark that becomes rough with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green with red stamens, bloom during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release three small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha centromalayca is a species native to the Malay Peninsula, specifically found in parts of southern Thailand and peninsular Malaysia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is largely restricted to its native range, with limited introduction outside of its natural habitat. It thrives in moist, tropical environments, often growing in lowland forests and along stream banks. This plant typically grows at altitudes below 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as vulnerable.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha centromalayca is a fast-growing, ornamental shrub known for its vibrant foliage and unique leaf patterns.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining the plant's genetic traits. This plant thrives in a warm climate with a growth cycle that includes a dormant period during colder months.</p>
<p>It requires well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain its shape and encourages bushier growth. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while diseases such as root rot can occur if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
