<p>Arctous microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved arctous, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers.</p>
<p>Arctous microphylla is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
