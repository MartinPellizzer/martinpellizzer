                <h1>Adenolinum grandiflorum</h1>
<p>Adenolinum grandiflorum, commonly known as the giant adenium, is a striking succulent native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, swollen trunk and large, lobed leaves that are typically green or variegated. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenolinum grandiflorum has simple, alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy green in color and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a straight, unbranched pattern. Its flowers are clustered in umbels, featuring white petals with a yellow center, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenolinum grandiflorum is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests where it thrives in humid, warm climates. This plant is often associated with sandy soils and can be seen growing along the edges of mangrove swamps. Its distribution is limited to these specific regions, and it is not found naturally elsewhere.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenolinum grandiflorum was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates due to its preference for warm, humid conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with well-drained soil and ample sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and certain regions of the Americas. This plant is often grown as an ornamental species because of its striking, large flowers that come in a variety of colors. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native flora.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential ecological impact in non-native habitats.</p>
