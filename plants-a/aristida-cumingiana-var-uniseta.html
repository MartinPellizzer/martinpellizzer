                    <h1>Aristida cumingiana var. uniseta</h1>
<p>Aristida cumingiana var. uniseta, commonly known as the narrow-seta grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to thrive in open, disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>It is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in sandy soils, where it plays a role in soil stabilization.</p>
