                    <h1>Astragalus preussii var. laxispicatus</h1>
<p>Astragalus preussii var. laxispicatus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small, hairy leaflets, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations.</p>
