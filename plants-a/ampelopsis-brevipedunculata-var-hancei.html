                    <h1>Ampelopsis brevipedunculata var. hancei</h1>
<p>Ampelopsis brevipedunculata var. hancei, commonly known as the Chinese devil's vine, is a vigorous climbing vine native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with three to five oval leaflets, often with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Its ornamental berries and foliage make it a popular choice in horticulture, though it can be invasive in some regions.</p>
