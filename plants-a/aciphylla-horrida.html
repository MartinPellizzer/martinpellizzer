                <h1>Aciphylla horrida</h1>
<p>Aciphylla horrida, commonly known as the bristly spinifex, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of southern Australia, where it thrives in harsh, sandy environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it conserve water and withstand strong winds. Its flowers, which appear in late spring, are small and yellow, clustered in a head-like structure.</p>
<p>Aciphylla horrida plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciphylla horrida has a low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, short, and arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is short and woody, with a rough, bark-like texture that is usually grey or brown in color. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pink or purple petals, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses its seeds by wind, and the plant has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla horrida is primarily native to the southern regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the mountainous areas of the South Island, particularly in the Southern Alps. This plant thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is often seen growing on scree slopes and in grasslands. It is well adapted to the cold and harsh climate of these regions.</p>
<p>Aciphylla horrida plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla horrida was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, particularly in the South Island. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or gravelly habitats. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to manage its distribution and minimize its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
