                        <h1>Acaena californica var. subglabriscapa</h1>
<p>Acaena californica var. subglabriscapa, commonly known as the California burrweed, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>It features small, spiny fruits that are adapted for seed dispersal by animals. The plant has alternate, narrow leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Its distinctive appearance and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena californica var. subglabriscapa is primarily native to coastal areas of central and southern California, including the Santa Barbara Channel and the Pacific Coast from San Luis Obispo County to Santa Barbara County.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils along the coastline and is commonly found in dunes and other coastal habitats. This variety is adapted to the mild, wet winters and dry summers typical of the California coast. It is often seen in association with other coastal flora such as beach strawberry and coastal buckwheat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant within its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena californica var. subglabriscapa was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in disturbed or degraded areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in dry, rocky conditions. This plant has been introduced to various parts of the western United States, including California and Oregon. It is often found in open woodlands and grasslands where it forms dense mats.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential in some regions has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities.</p>
