                <h1>Actinea arizonica</h1>
<p>Actinea arizonica, commonly known as Arizona actinia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs.</p>
<p>Actinea arizonica is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinea arizonica has small, compound leaves that are palmately arranged, with each leaflet being oval-shaped, ranging from 1 to 3 centimeters in length, and exhibiting a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light gray bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. It produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers with five petals, blooming in early spring, and is pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea arizonica is primarily native to the southwestern United States, specifically Arizona and New Mexico, as well as parts of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes. This plant is commonly associated with areas having a Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It is typically found in open habitats such as grasslands, scrublands, and along rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea arizonica was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fern-like foliage. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
