                <h1>Aechmea pulchella</h1>
<p>Aechmea pulchella, commonly known as the pink pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from the environment. The plant's foliage is typically green with a reddish or pinkish hue, especially in its mature stages. It produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears showy, violet or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Aechmea pulchella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea pulchella has rosette-shaped leaves that are fleshy, grass-like, and arranged in a tight spiral, with a bright green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>It lacks a true stem, but its basal rosette forms a pseudostem that is short and compact. The plant produces striking violet or pink flowers that are clustered in a spike, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that disperses seeds through wind and animal consumption.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the air and soil.</p>
