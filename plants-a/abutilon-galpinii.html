<p>Abutilon galpinii, commonly known as the Galpin's abutilon, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves. The leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin and a rough texture. Its showy, yellow-orange flowers are borne in clusters and bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon galpinii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. Its flowers are pendulous, with a 5-lobed calyx and yellowish-green petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, anchoring the plant and helping it survive in dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon galpinii is a flowering plant native to southern Africa, specifically found in Namibia and southwestern Angola.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes regions where it was originally found, though it is now considered rare and restricted to a few localities. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Abutilon galpinii is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon galpinii is a fast-growing, shrub-like plant native to South Africa, known for its vibrant, lantern-shaped flowers and fuzzy, maple-like leaves.</p>
