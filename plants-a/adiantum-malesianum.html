                <h1>Adiantum malesianum</h1>
<p>Adiantum malesianum, commonly known as the Malay maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often bronze or reddish in color when young. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through its habitat.</p>
<p>The leaves are bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that resembles the wings of a bird, hence its common name.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum malesianum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lacey appearance, typically ranging from 10 to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that remains hidden beneath the foliage. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are wind-pollinated and bloom during the summer months. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum malesianum is primarily native to Borneo, China South-Central, China Southeast, Malaya, Myanmar, New Caledonia, New Guinea, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Sulawesi, Sumatera, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vanuatu.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these areas. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. The plant's distribution spans a wide range of island and mainland regions in Southeast Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>Its presence in such diverse locations highlights its adaptability to different ecological conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum malesianum was mainly introduced to the eastern and southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Atlantic coast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often seen in disturbed or riparian habitats. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and spread.</p>
