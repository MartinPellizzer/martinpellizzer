                        <h1>Acacia mangium</h1>
<p>Acacia mangium, commonly known as white acacia, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Acacia mangium is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it valuable for reforestation and agroforestry.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes nitrogen fixation, which enriches the soil and supports other plant life.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia mangium belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses a group of vascular plants that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their simple, often primitive structures. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse morphological features.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have compound leaves and flowers with a unique structure. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume family, characterized by pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive, often thorny structures and nitrogen-fixing capabilities.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia mangium, a fast-growing tree native to Southeast Asia, widely used for timber and as a source of fodder.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia mangium is primarily native to Maluku, New Guinea, and Queensland.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with lowland and hill forest ecosystems. Acacia mangium is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse environmental conditions of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia mangium was mainly introduced to Bangladesh, Borneo, Cameroon, Comoros, Cook Is., Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, DR Congo, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guinea, Hawaii, India, Lesser Sunda Is., Malaya, Myanmar, Nicaragua, Northern Territory, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Tokelau-Manihiki, Trinidad-Tobago, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>It was introduced primarily for its fast growth and potential for timber and fuelwood production. The plant has been widely cultivated in these regions due to its adaptability to various soil types and climatic conditions. However, its introduction has also raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in some areas.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, Acacia mangium remains an important species in reforestation and afforestation programs across the tropics.</p>
