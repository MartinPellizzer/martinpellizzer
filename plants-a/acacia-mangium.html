                        <h1>Acacia mangium</h1>
<p>Acacia mangium, commonly known as white acacia, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Acacia mangium is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it valuable for reforestation and agroforestry.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes nitrogen fixation, which enriches the soil and supports other plant life.</p>
