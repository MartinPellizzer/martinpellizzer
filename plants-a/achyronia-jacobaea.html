                <h1>Achyronia jacobaea</h1>
<p>Achyronia jacobaea, commonly known as the common ragwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of blue-green leaves and yellow-orange flowers. The plant contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which are toxic to livestock and can cause liver damage. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia jacobaea has leaves that are alternate, lanceolate in shape, and have a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, erect, and has a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a straight, unbranched pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind when it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia jacobaea is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the regions of the Western Cape and the Eastern Cape provinces. This plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in open habitats such as fynbos vegetation. It is commonly found in coastal and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>The species is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia jacobaea was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as landscaping and gardening.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban areas, where it thrives in nutrient-rich conditions. This plant has spread to several regions outside its native range, including parts of North America and Europe. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact varies depending on the local ecosystem and management practices.</p>
