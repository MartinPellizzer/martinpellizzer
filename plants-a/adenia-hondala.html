                <h1>Adenia hondala</h1>
<p>Adenia hondala, commonly known as the Honduras adenium, is a member of the Passifloraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree native to Central America, particularly found in countries like Honduras and Guatemala. The plant features thick, fleshy stems and leaves with a rough, sometimes hairy texture. Its flowers are showy, with five petals and a distinctive crown of filaments, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>The fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia hondala has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are clustered in cymes, featuring a bright yellow color, and bloom during the dry season; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous, helping the plant store nutrients and survive in dry conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia hondala is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the island of Hispaniola, which includes the countries of Haiti and the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>Although it was once found in specific regions of the island, its current distribution is extremely limited, with only a few known populations remaining. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests, typically growing on rocky or mossy substrates. Adenia hondala is found at moderate altitudes, ranging from approximately 300 to 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and fragmentation, it is listed as critically endangered, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts to protect this unique species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenia hondala is a striking tropical plant known for its large, waxy leaves and unique floral display.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. This plant has a slow growth cycle, typically flowering after several years, making patience essential for gardeners.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to maintain shape and encourage blooms are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or mealybugs, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>
