                <h1>Adenia hondala</h1>
<p>Adenia hondala, commonly known as the Honduran adenium, is a flowering plant native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and striking, showy flowers. The plant produces large, pentagonal leaves and has a distinctive, swollen caudex that stores water, aiding in its survival in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow with red filaments, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>Adenia hondala is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia hondala has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically reddish-brown in color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small and clustered in panicles, featuring five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in nutrient-rich soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia hondala is primarily native to India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within forests. It is part of the Passifloraceae family and is known for its distinctive flowers.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific geographic locations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia hondala was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions such as Hawaii and the Cook Islands.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and unique flowering pattern. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it well-suited for the warm, humid environments of these islands. However, it has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, its introduction has led to discussions about ecological impact and management strategies.</p>
