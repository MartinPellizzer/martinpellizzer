                    <h1>Aspidium diffractum</h1>
<p>Aspidium diffractum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions near streams or in woodland areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>Aspidium diffractum plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to soil stability.</p>
