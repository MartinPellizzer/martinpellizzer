                        <h1>Acanthophyllum aphananthum</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum aphananthum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle floral display. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
