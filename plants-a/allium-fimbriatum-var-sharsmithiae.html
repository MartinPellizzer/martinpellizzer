                    <h1>Allium fimbriatum var. sharsmithiae</h1>
<p>Allium fimbriatum var. sharsmithiae, commonly known as the Sharsmith's onion, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pale pink to white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that are often covered in a fibrous sheath, typical of the Allium genus. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
