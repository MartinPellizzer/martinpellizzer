                <h1>Adansonia alba</h1>
<p>Adansonia alba, commonly known as the white baobab, is a striking tree native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, rounded trunk and thick, flaky bark that can reach several meters in thickness. The tree produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are palmate, consisting of several lobes, and it has a unique ability to store water in its trunk, allowing it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant also plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adansonia alba has large, palmate leaves that are typically bright green, with a broad, fan-like shape and a prominent central vein, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is thick, woody, and covered with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes fissured with age, growing in a straight, upright pattern. Its flowers are large, white, and fragrant, with a complex structure consisting of multiple petals and stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by bats. The fruit is a fibrous, woody capsule that splits open to release numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the tree to anchor itself and access water from deep underground.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adansonia alba is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the dry deciduous forests and spiny forests of the island. This species thrives in regions with a tropical climate and seasonal rainfall. It is often seen in the central and eastern parts of Madagascar.</p>
<p>Adansonia alba is a notable member of the baobab family, known for its distinctive appearance and ecological importance.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adansonia alba was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, dry climate, typically found in regions with seasonal rainfall.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments where it can receive full sun exposure and has good drainage, making it suitable for cultivation in arid and semi-arid regions. This plant is often introduced to gardens and landscapes in tropical and subtropical areas where it can be grown as an ornamental or for its ecological benefits. Its introduction has been primarily for horticultural purposes, due to its striking white flowers and unique appearance.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
