                <h1>Acer campestre var. hebecarpum</h1>
<p>Acer campestre var. hebecarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maple, is a variant of the common maple tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 7 lobed. The plant produces small, winged samaras that are distinct from the typical maple seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its unique leaf morphology and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. hebecarpum has palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-7 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences during late spring, with a wind pollination method. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. hebecarpum is a rare variant of the field maple, native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and southern France.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Iberian Peninsula. It thrives in open woodlands, rocky slopes, and sunny meadows, often in nutrient-poor soils. This plant is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat fragmentation, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. hebecarpum is a compact, slow-growing maple known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through softwood cuttings in early summer or by seeds sown in the fall. This variety thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, fertile soil, requiring moderate watering during dry periods.</p>
<p>Fertilize it in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. hebecarpum is a hardy shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in woodland ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and promoting the growth of other native species. The plant also contributes to erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving soil quality and supporting a diverse range of insect life.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. hebecarpum is a lesser-known variant of the common maple tree, primarily valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and soil stabilization.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential nutritional value in traditional diets. In medicinal contexts, it has been studied for its possible antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, though research is limited. Industrially, it contributes to the timber industry in small quantities, supporting local economies in certain regions.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and adaptability, often found in native landscapes where it plays a subtle but important part in the ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. hebecarpum has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Gumpoldskirchen' and 'Crimson King,' which are known for their striking foliage and compact growth.</p>
<p>It also serves as a parent in several hybrids, such as the popular Acer x carpinifolium, which combines the hardiness of horse chestnut with the ornamental traits of maples. These hybrids are often used in horticulture for their ability to thrive in urban environments and their adaptability to various soil conditions. The cultivars and hybrids of this species are highly valued for their resilience and aesthetic appeal in landscaping.</p>
<p>Due to their versatility, they play a significant role in modern horticultural practices.</p>
