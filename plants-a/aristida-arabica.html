                    <h1>Aristida arabica</h1>
<p>Aristida arabica, commonly known as the Arabian wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. The plant is adapted to survive in drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Its leaves are narrow and tough, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Aristida arabica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
