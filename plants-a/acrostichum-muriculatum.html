                <h1>Acrostichum muriculatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum muriculatum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, rusty-brown hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile ones in the second.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum muriculatum has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a rough, fibrous texture and a light greenish-brown color, growing upright with a climbing or creeping habit. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed, dry capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and adventitious, often forming dense networks in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum muriculatum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid environments with abundant moisture and partial to full sunlight. Its distribution extends into the Caribbean islands as well.</p>
<p>It is often associated with disturbed or nutrient-rich soils in lowland areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum muriculatum was mainly introduced to coastal and wetland areas where it thrives in moist, saline environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. This plant has been reported in several tropical and subtropical locations, including parts of the Caribbean and Southeast Asia. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to invade native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
