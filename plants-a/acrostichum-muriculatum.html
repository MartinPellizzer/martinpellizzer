                    <h1>Acrostichum muriculatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum muriculatum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, rusty-brown hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile ones in the second.</p>
