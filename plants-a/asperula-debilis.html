                    <h1>Asperula debilis</h1>
<p>Asperula debilis, commonly known as the creeping azalea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a dense, carpet-like ground cover. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it an ideal choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Asperula debilis is also valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate wet conditions, though it may require protection in colder climates.</p>
