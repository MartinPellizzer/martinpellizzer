                    <h1>Arabis chanetii</h1>
<p>Arabis chanetii, commonly known as the alpine rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine environments. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
