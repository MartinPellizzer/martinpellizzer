                <h1>Achillea mucronulata</h1>
<p>Achillea mucronulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features wiry, branched stems and basal leaves that are narrow and linear, often with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine is attributed to its aromatic compounds and potential anti-inflammatory properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea mucronulata has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually gray-green in color, with a slightly rough texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. Its flowers are small, yellowish-white composite blooms with a fluffy center, arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small achene enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal, and the seeds are lightweight and adapted for airborne spread.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea mucronulata is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky soils and open habitats such as scrublands and limestone areas. This plant thrives in temperate climates with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. It is often associated with coastal and mountainous regions where it can tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends across several countries, including Spain, Italy, and Turkey.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea mucronulata was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and hardiness. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for various environmental conditions. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its introduction has had both positive ecological and potential negative impacts depending on the local ecosystem.</p>
