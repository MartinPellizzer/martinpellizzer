                    <h1>Arabis breweri var. figularis</h1>
<p>Arabis breweri var. figularis, commonly known as the desert sandparsley, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and gray-green, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in sandy and rocky soils.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to harsh desert conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
