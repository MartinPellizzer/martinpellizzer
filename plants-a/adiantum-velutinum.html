                <h1>Adiantum velutinum</h1>
<p>Adiantum velutinum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are covered in a soft, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually light green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters.</p>
<p>Adiantum velutinum is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum velutinum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and they are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark. This plant does not produce flowers, as it is a spore-bearing fern, and instead reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum velutinum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including parts of Georgia, Florida, and Alabama.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along streams. This fern is commonly found in acidic soils and is often associated with woodland habitats. It is also present in some regions of Mexico, particularly in the southern states.</p>
<p>Adiantum velutinum is well adapted to humid climates and is often seen in wetland areas and rocky outcrops.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum velutinum was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, particularly in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. This species is often found growing on rocky substrates or in areas with high humidity. Its introduction has been largely due to its ornamental value and ability to adapt to various soil types.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in many areas where it has established itself in the wild.</p>
