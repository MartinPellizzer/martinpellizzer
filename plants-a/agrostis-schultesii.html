                    <h1>Agrostis schultesii</h1>
<p>Agrostis schultesii, commonly known as Schultes' bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Agrostis schultesii is often found in wetland ecosystems, where it plays a role in maintaining ecological balance.</p>
