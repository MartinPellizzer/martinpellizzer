                    <h1>Aphania senegalensis var. silvatica</h1>
<p>Aphania senegalensis var. silvatica, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the dry forests of West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood, which is highly valued for its use in incense and traditional medicine. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy coating. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
