<p>Anthoxanthum odoratum f. tenerum, commonly known as sweet vernal grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that bear spikelets with pale yellow to orange bristles. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, and it is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and meadows. Its foliage has a mild, pleasant aroma, especially when crushed, which contributes to its common name.</p>
<p>This variety is more tender and less robust than the typical form of sweet vernal grass, making it suitable for more delicate growing conditions.</p>
