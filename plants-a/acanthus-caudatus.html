                <h1>Acanthus caudatus</h1>
<p>Acanthus caudatus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, spiny leaves that are often used in classical architecture and decorative arts. The plant produces tall, spiky inflorescences with blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and historical significance in art and design further highlight its botanical and cultural importance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acanthus caudatus has large, deeply lobed leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured as the plant matures. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences composed of spathulate bracts and small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthus caudatus is a striking herbaceous plant native to southern Europe, particularly the Iberian Peninsula, Italy, and parts of southern France.</p>
<p>While it was historically more widespread, its current distribution is limited, with populations found primarily in southern Spain and Portugal. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats such as limestone cliffs and coastal areas, often growing in full sun. This species typically occurs at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 600 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Acanthus caudatus is considered vulnerable, and its conservation status is of concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acanthus caudatus is a striking ornamental plant known for its tall, spiky leaves and showy, lavender-blue flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with the latter method being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. This perennial grows best in full sun to partial shade, with a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter and active growth in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilize it in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune dead foliage in late winter to encourage new growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs; companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter these issues.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acanthus caudatus is a hardy plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy, spiny flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acanthus caudatus is a decorative plant known for its ornate foliage and historical use in ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, it has been historically used in some traditional cuisines for its aromatic leaves. In medicinal contexts, it has been explored for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Industrially, it contributes to the horticultural trade and landscape design, supporting economic activities in gardening and floral industries.</p>
<p>Culturally, it has symbolic significance in art and architecture, often representing beauty and elegance in decorative motifs.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
