                <h1>Adiantum curvatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum curvatum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are bipinnate, with each leaflet being narrow and slightly curved. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or near streams. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly through underground stems.</p>
<p>Adiantum curvatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum curvatum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and they are typically arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green, lanceolate in shape, and can grow up to 30 cm in length, with a finely serrated margin. The stem is slender and wiry, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Adiantum curvatum produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the form of spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the leaves, and it does not have true flowers or seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum curvatum is primarily native to Brazil Northeast, Brazil South, and Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. The plant is well adapted to the humid climate and diverse ecosystems of these regions.</p>
<p>Its native distribution highlights its ecological significance in the biodiversity of Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum curvatum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. This fern is commonly found in the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region. It has also been introduced to parts of Europe and Asia for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely influenced by its preference for cool, humid climates and its ability to tolerate partial shade.</p>
