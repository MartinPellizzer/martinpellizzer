                    <h1>Aconitum lycoctonum var. puberulum</h1>
<p>Aconitum lycoctonum var. puberulum, commonly known as the pubescent aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a robust root system and tall, upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its varietal name "puberulum.". Its leaves are deeply lobed and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>However, like all aconites, it contains potent toxins and should be handled with care.</p>
