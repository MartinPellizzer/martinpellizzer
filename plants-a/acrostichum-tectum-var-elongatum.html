<p>It is a perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions, characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense clumps.</p>
