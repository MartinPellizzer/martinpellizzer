                        <h1>Acacia pedleyi</h1>
<p>Acacia pedleyi, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and narrow, feathery leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in compact, globular clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Acacia pedleyi is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and nectar for native wildlife.</p>
