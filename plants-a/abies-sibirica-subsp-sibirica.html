                        <h1>Abies sibirica subsp. sibirica</h1>
<p>Abies sibirica subsp.</p>
<p>sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the cold regions of Siberia and parts of northern Asia. It typically grows in boreal forests and mountainous areas, thriving in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>The tree has a conical shape with dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally along the branches. Its cones are usually pendulous, maturing to a reddish-brown color, and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is often used in landscaping in temperate climates.</p>
