                <h1>Acer pulchrum</h1>
<p>Acer pulchrum, commonly known as the beautiful maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and prefers well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Acer pulchrum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pulchrum has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, reaching up to 8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures. It produces small, clustered flowers with four petal-like sepals, typically in shades of red or orange, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pulchrum is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Tibet.</p>
<p>Although it was once more widely distributed, its current range is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes at altitudes between 2,000 and 3,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Acer pulchrum is considered endangered, and conservation efforts are underway to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pulchrum is a deciduous tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer pulchrum includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Regular fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches promote healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or powdery mildew, and it benefits from companion planting with flowering shrubs to enhance biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pulchrum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers and serves as a valuable nectar source during the spring season. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a wide range of ecological interactions. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it an effective stabilizer in hilly or disturbed landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer pulchrum contributes to carbon sequestration and improves soil health through leaf litter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pulchrum is a decorative tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage, making it a popular choice in ornamental horticulture and landscape design.</p>
<p>While its leaves are not typically used in culinary applications, the tree is valued for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and urban environments. In traditional medicine, some parts of the tree may have been used for their potential therapeutic properties, though research is limited. Economically, it contributes to the horticultural industry by providing ornamental value and supporting related businesses.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes beauty and seasonal change, often inspiring art and literature.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pulchrum has several popular cultivars such as 'Variegatum', known for its striking yellow-variegated leaves, and 'Atrosanguineum', which features dark red foliage in autumn.</p>
<p>It also has hybrids with other maple species, contributing to a wider range of ornamental traits. These varieties are highly valued in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to different climates. Their unique leaf colors and seasonal changes make them popular choices for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Horticulturists often use these cultivars and hybrids to enhance visual interest in both residential and public spaces.</p>
