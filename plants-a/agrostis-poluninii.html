<p>Agrostis poluninii, commonly known as the Polunin's bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is a perennial species, meaning it lives for more than two years, and is known for its ability to form dense turf.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance, it is often considered an indicator species for certain habitat types.</p>
