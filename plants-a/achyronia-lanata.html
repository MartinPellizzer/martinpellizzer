                <h1>Achyronia lanata</h1>
<p>Achyronia lanata, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, purple to blue flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that turns red when mature.</p>
<p>Achyronia lanata is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia lanata has hairy, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in dense white woolly hairs, and has a light green to grayish color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia lanata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland forests and along riverbanks where the climate is warm and moist. This plant thrives in shaded undergrowth and is often associated with secondary growth areas. Its distribution is largely limited to the Amazon Basin and surrounding regions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its natural range has been reduced in recent decades.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia lanata was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida and Georgia.</p>
<p>It was brought in for its ornamental value due to its distinctive, woolly appearance. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native plant species. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
