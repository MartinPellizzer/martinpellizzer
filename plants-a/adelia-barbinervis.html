                <h1>Adelia barbinervis</h1>
<p>Adelia barbinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined adelia, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to semi-shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia barbinervis has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its small, clustered flowers are yellow with four petals, blooming in spring and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases winged seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia barbinervis is primarily native to Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico Central, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Southeast, Mexico Southwest, and Nicaragua.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. The species is well-adapted to the humid climate and seasonal rainfall patterns of its native range.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia barbinervis was mainly introduced to new habitats in regions with temperate climates, particularly in areas with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It has been observed spreading along roadsides and in disturbed areas due to its adaptability and rapid growth rate. The plant's introduction has raised concerns among local ecologists due to its potential to outcompete native species. It is commonly found in parts of Europe and North America where it has established itself as an invasive species.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor and control its spread to minimize ecological impact.</p>
