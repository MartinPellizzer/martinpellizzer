                    <h1>Asclepias pedicellata</h1>
<p>Asclepias pedicellata, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a hairy texture.</p>
<p>Asclepias pedicellata plays a vital role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae.</p>
