<p>Alchemilla obovalis, commonly known as narrowleaf lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, erect stems. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight.</p>
<p>Alchemilla obovalis is often found in moist, shaded woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties.</p>
