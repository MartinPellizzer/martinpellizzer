<p>Artemisia borealis subsp.</p>
<p>richardsoniana, commonly known as Arctic wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that appear in late summer, contributing to its role in pollinator habitats. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is a key component of the vegetation in high-latitude environments.</p>
