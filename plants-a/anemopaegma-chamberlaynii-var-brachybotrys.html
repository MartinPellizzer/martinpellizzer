<p>Anemopaegma chamberlaynii var. brachybotrys, commonly known as the short-stemmed anemopaegma, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late spring. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variant is characterized by its compact growth habit and reduced flower size compared to the typical species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and endangered species.</p>
