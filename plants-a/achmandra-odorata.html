                <h1>Achmandra odorata</h1>
<p>Achmandra odorata, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has long, slender leaves and produces intricate, orchid-like blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Achmandra odorata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and aromatic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achmandra odorata has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with five petals, blooming in the spring and attracting pollinators such as bees through its sweet scent. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achmandra odorata is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid climates and is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. This plant is also present in parts of East Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. It is often associated with aquatic or semi-aquatic environments due to its preference for moist soil.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to these geographic areas, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achmandra odorata was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated in gardens and as a landscape plant. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in some areas, sometimes becoming invasive.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been spread through both intentional cultivation and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
