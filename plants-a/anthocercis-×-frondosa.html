                    <h1>Anthocercis × frondosa</h1>
<p>Anthocercis × frondosa, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a rare and unique plant resulting from the cross between two different fern species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that exhibit a striking contrast of green and sometimes variegated colors. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodlands or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of its fronds, a feature common to many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Anthocercis × frondosa is often found in isolated populations and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
