                    <h1>Andringitra muscosa</h1>
<p>Andringitra muscosa, commonly known as the Madagascar moss, is a unique fern-like plant native to the eastern rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping growth habit with slender, arching fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or among leaf litter. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, rounded groups along the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Andringitra muscosa is considered an endangered species.</p>
