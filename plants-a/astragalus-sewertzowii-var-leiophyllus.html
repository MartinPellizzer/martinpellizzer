                    <h1>Astragalus sewertzowii var. leiophyllus</h1>
<p>Astragalus sewertzowii var. leiophyllus, commonly known as the smooth-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor and drought-prone soils. Its small, pod-like fruits contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous leaf surfaces, setting it apart from other members of the Astragalus genus.</p>
