                <h1>Acyntha zeylanica</h1>
<p>Acyntha zeylanica, commonly known as the Indian balsam, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of hair, while its stems are square in cross-section.</p>
<p>Acyntha zeylanica is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acyntha zeylanica has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light green to brownish bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with five pale blue to white petals and a yellowish center, blooming from March to May and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind after splitting open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acyntha zeylanica is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in forest understories and along the edges of wetlands, where it can access adequate moisture and nutrients. Its distribution also extends to some parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands, though these populations may be introduced rather than native.</p>
<p>Acyntha zeylanica plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acyntha zeylanica was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments, where it thrives in areas with moderate sunlight. The plant has shown adaptability to different climatic conditions, allowing it to spread beyond its native range. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its original distribution.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems remains under study.</p>
