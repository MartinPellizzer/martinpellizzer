                    <h1>Aizoon quadrifidum</h1>
<p>Aizoon quadrifidum, commonly known as the four-lobed cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem with distinctive four-lobed segments that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing transpiration.</p>
<p>Aizoon quadrifidum is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
