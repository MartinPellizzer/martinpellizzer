                <h1>Acmella ramosa</h1>
<p>Acmella ramosa, commonly known as the spiked sunflower, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with a distinctive spiky center. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Acmella ramosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella ramosa has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth surface and a bright green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a smooth, light green bark, and exhibits a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, yellow with red centers, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the dry season; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread widely to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella ramosa is primarily native to Mexico Central and the Mexico Gulf region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas within these regions. The plant thrives in wetland habitats and along the edges of water bodies. It is often associated with marshy environments and is part of the local flora in these areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the moist, humid climates of central and southern Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella ramosa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and wetland environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near water bodies. This plant has been reported in several regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to human activities such as land clearing and agricultural expansion.</p>
