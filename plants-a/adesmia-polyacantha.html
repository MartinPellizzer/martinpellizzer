                <h1>Adesmia polyacantha</h1>
<p>Adesmia polyacantha, commonly known as the hairy legume, is a shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant features dense, thorny stems and small, often hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically clustered in racemes and range in color from white to pale pink.</p>
<p>Adesmia polyacantha is adapted to arid environments, making it a resilient plant in dry regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia polyacantha has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, and a dark green color on the upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a grayish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern that becomes more complex as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring five white petals and a yellow center, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, spherical capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and small size.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia polyacantha is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Brazil, Peru, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry to semi-arid environments, often found in scrublands and rocky areas. The plant is well adapted to harsh climates with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in arid regions for its ornamental and practical uses.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia polyacantha was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread across various regions, particularly in the North Island. The plant is now considered a potential weed in some areas, as it can outcompete native species in disturbed habitats. Its distribution is primarily limited to coastal and lowland areas where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, its invasive potential has led to increased monitoring and management efforts.</p>
