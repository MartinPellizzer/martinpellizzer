                    <h1>Alvordia</h1>
<p>Alvordia, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Alvordia is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Its leaves are typically covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss and are often hairy to further aid in moisture retention.</p>
