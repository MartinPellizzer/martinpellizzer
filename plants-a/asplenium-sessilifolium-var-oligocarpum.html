                    <h1>Asplenium sessilifolium var. oligocarpum</h1>
<p>Asplenium sessilifolium var. oligocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a variant of the common rock fern native to the Appalachian region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack stalks. The plant typically grows in rocky, shaded environments, such as cliffs and crevices, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its limited fruiting, as indicated by its name "oligocarpum," which refers to its sparse production of spores.</p>
