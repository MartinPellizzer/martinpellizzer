                        <h1>Acantholimon scorpius var. balutchii</h1>
<p>Acantholimon scorpius var. balutchii, commonly known as the Baluch sandthorn, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features compact, cushion-like growth with dense clusters of small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh, saline soils and extreme temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its local flora.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon scorpius var. balutchii is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, particularly in the countries of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and southern Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in desert steppes and rocky outcrops. This variety is well adapted to extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. It is commonly found in areas with sparse vegetation, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its specific environmental requirements, its distribution is relatively limited and localized.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon scorpius var. balutchii was mainly introduced to areas with dry, rocky soils and arid or semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as Central Asia, parts of the Middle East, and southern Europe. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in mountainous or coastal environments. It is valued for its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to regions where it can establish itself in natural or disturbed habitats.</p>
