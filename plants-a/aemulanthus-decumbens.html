<p>Aemulanthus decumbens, commonly known as the decumbent morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and arid environments. The plant features slender, prostrate stems that lie close to the ground, often sprawling across the soil surface. Its flowers are trumpet-shaped, with vibrant blue or purple petals that bloom in the early morning.</p>
