<p>Amygdalus erioclada, commonly known as the desert almond, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval leaves and fragrant, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, hard-shelled fruits that contain edible seeds, similar to those of the common almond. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a thick cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Amygdalus erioclada is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens.</p>
