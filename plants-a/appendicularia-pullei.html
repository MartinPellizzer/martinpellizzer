<p>Appendicularia pullei, commonly known as the marine appendicularian, is a tiny, transparent tunicate that belongs to the subphylum Appendicularia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, jellyfish-like body covered in a delicate, mucus-secreting tunic. This organism is filter feeder, using a specialized structure called a "house" to trap planktonic food from the water. Appendicularia pullei plays an important role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as a food source for various marine organisms.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves both a larval and adult stage, with the adult stage being the only one that exhibits the characteristic tunic.</p>
