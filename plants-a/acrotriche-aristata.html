<p>Acrotriche aristata, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. It produces a tall, erect stem that bears the showy flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Acrotriche aristata is adapted to extreme drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
