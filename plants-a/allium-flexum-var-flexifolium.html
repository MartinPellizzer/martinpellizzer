<p>Allium flexum var. flexifolium, commonly known as the flexible leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow, flexible leaves that can bend without breaking, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs, though not as commonly cultivated as other alliums, are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
