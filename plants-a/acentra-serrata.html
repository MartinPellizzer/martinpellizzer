                        <h1>Acentra serrata</h1>
<p>Acentra serrata, commonly known as the serrated acentra, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its opposite, serrated leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique leaf structure and potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acentra serrata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with rainforests or secondary growth habitats. It is also present in parts of the Philippines and Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>Acentra serrata is typically found in shaded or semi-shaded environments within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acentra serrata was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been observed thriving in disturbed soils and areas with moderate moisture levels. This plant is commonly found in urban and suburban settings where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to concerns about its invasive potential in certain regions.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread into natural ecosystems.</p>
