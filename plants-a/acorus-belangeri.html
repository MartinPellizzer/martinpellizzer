                    <h1>Acorus belangeri</h1>
<p>Acorus belangeri, commonly known as the Belanger's sweet flag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, a characteristic feature of the Aroid family. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments with muddy or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies in its ecological role within wetland ecosystems.</p>
