                <h1>Acorus belangeri</h1>
<p>Acorus belangeri, commonly known as the Belanger's sweet flag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, a characteristic feature of the Aroid family. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments with muddy or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies in its ecological role within wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus belangeri has long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bright green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and cylindrical, with a light green color, growing from rhizomes that spread horizontally underground. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters at the base of the leaves, blooming in early spring, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dark brown, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus belangeri is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats, marshes, and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies. This plant thrives in moist to aquatic environments and is often associated with swampy areas and riverbanks. Its native range also extends to parts of the Philippines and some regions of India.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the local ecosystems where it grows.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus belangeri was mainly introduced to aquatic and wetland habitats, where it thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams and rivers. This plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality. Its presence can indicate the health of an ecosystem, as it prefers clean, nutrient-rich environments.</p>
<p>However, in some regions, it has become invasive, outcompeting native species and altering habitat structure.</p>
