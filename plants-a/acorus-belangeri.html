                <h1>Acorus belangeri</h1>
<p>Acorus belangeri, commonly known as the Belanger's sweetflag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater wetlands and marshes, often forming dense, grass-like colonies. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are usually bright green and have a distinctive, waxy texture. Its inflorescence consists of small, yellowish-green flowers that emerge on tall, slender stems above the water.</p>
<p>Acorus belangeri plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus belangeri has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright from the base. It produces small, white flowers in a spadix surrounded by a green spathe, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed berry that disperses its seeds by water, as the seeds are buoyant.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming a dense underground network that helps the plant spread and anchor itself.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus belangeri is a species of plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries such as India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>While its native range is well-documented, it is now also cultivated in various parts of the world, including parts of Europe and North America, often as an ornamental plant. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams, where it can tolerate both still and flowing water. Acorus belangeri typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 1,000 meters, and prefers moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its natural habitat is threatened by habitat loss and human activity, leading to concerns about its long-term conservation status.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acorus belangeri is a hardy, aromatic plant known for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through rhizome division or by sowing seeds, with rhizome division being the most reliable method. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a year under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-draining soil and requires regular watering to maintain consistent moisture levels. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning dead foliage in early spring helps maintain its appearance.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract slugs or snails in damp conditions, and it pairs well with water lilies or other aquatic plants in a pond setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acorus belangeri is a wetland plant that provides food and shelter for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its attractive flowers. The plant acts as a natural filter, helping to improve water quality by absorbing pollutants. Its dense growth also helps prevent soil erosion in wetland areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acorus belangeri serves as a companion plant for other wetland species, promoting biodiversity and ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acorus belangeri is a wetland plant that has limited culinary use due to its strong odor and bitter taste, though it is occasionally used in traditional recipes in some regions.</p>
<p>It has been historically valued for its medicinal properties, with traditional uses including treating respiratory issues and digestive disorders. Industrially, it is not widely utilized, but its presence in wetlands contributes to ecological balance and water filtration. Culturally, it is sometimes associated with spiritual or symbolic meanings in local traditions.</p>
<p>Overall, its role is more ecological and traditional rather than commercial.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acorus belangeri has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aureus' and 'Variegatus', which are known for their striking yellow or variegated foliage. Hybrids of Acorus belangeri are often created to enhance leaf color, texture, and hardiness, making them suitable for a wider range of garden conditions. These plants are of horticultural importance due to their ability to thrive in wet or boggy soils and their aesthetic appeal in water gardens and shaded landscapes.</p>
<p>Their unique appearance and resilience have made them a favored choice among gardeners and landscape designers.</p>
