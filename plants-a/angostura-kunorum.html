                    <h1>Angostura kunorum</h1>
<p>Angostura kunorum, commonly known as the black orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which are highly unusual in the orchid family. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Angostura kunorum is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
