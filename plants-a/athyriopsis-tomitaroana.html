<p>Athyriopsis tomitaroana, commonly known as the Hawaiian rock fern, is a rare fern species native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and small, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky substrates in montane forests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species.</p>
