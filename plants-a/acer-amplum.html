                <h1>Acer amplum</h1>
<p>Acer amplum, commonly known as the white maple, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and smooth, light gray bark. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with five to seven pointed lobes, and turn bright yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer amplum has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in panicles, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, acidic soils of its preferred habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer amplum is a deciduous tree native to central and eastern Europe, including parts of Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>It is now found in scattered locations across its native range, with some populations in western Europe due to human introduction. This species thrives in temperate climates, typically in moist, well-drained soils in woodlands or along riverbanks. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Acer amplum is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, though it is relatively rare and faces threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer amplum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various environments.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for germination. The growth cycle of Acer amplum includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for its health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with other native plants in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer amplum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its spring blossoms and serves as a habitat for numerous organisms throughout the year. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a complex food web. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape and improving water retention.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer amplum contributes to carbon sequestration, playing a vital role in maintaining ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer amplum is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been used in traditional medicine to treat ailments such as inflammation and digestive issues. In industrial contexts, its wood is relatively soft and has been used for crafting and small-scale construction. Culturally, it has been a symbol of resilience and renewal in various regional traditions.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting local biodiversity also makes it important for environmental conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
