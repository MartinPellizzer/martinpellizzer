                <h1>Acer amplum</h1>
<p>Acer amplum, commonly known as the mountain maple, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in mountainous regions and thrives in cool, moist environments. The tree has a rounded crown and produces small, palmate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its flowers are inconspicuous, and it produces samaras, or winged seeds, for dispersal.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acer amplum belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their primitive vascular structures. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a large group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species.</p>
<p>Its order is Sapindales, a group of flowering plants that includes trees and shrubs with often fragrant flowers. Its family is Sapindaceae, commonly known as the soapberry family, which includes plants with showy flowers and often toxic fruits. Its genus is Acer, commonly known as maples, which are deciduous trees or shrubs with opposite leaves and distinctive sap.</p>
<p>Its species is Acer amplum, a specific type of maple native to Europe, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer amplum has palmately compound leaves that are typically 5â€“7 lobed, with a broad ovate shape, alternate arrangement, and a dark green upper surface that turns red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and twining, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, yellow-green, and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and helping it thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer amplum is a species of maple native to Central and Eastern Europe, including countries such as Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to scattered populations in these regions. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in forests and along river valleys, preferring a temperate climate. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Acer amplum is classified as a vulnerable species in some areas, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer amplum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seed propagation requiring stratification to break dormancy. The growth cycle of Acer amplum involves rapid growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy during winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with flowering shrubs and perennials in garden designs.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer amplum is a small deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers in spring. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a range of ecological interactions. Its dense foliage offers protection to smaller animals, contributing to habitat complexity.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer amplum plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, stabilizing soil in riparian areas.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer amplum is a species of maple tree known for its ecological importance and historical significance.</p>
<p>While its fruit is not typically used in culinary applications, the tree provides habitat and food for various wildlife species. In traditional medicine, parts of the tree have been used to treat ailments such as respiratory issues and skin conditions. Industrially, the wood of Acer amplum is valued for its durability and has been used in construction and furniture-making.</p>
<p>Culturally, it has symbolic meaning in some regions, representing resilience and longevity.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer amplum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Erectum,' which are known for their striking foliage and compact growth habits. Hybrids of Acer amplum are often created to enhance traits such as cold hardiness, fall color, and disease resistance. These cultivars and hybrids play an important role in horticulture, particularly in landscapes where unique leaf color and form are desired.</p>
<p>Their use in gardens and parks highlights the plant's significance in ornamental horticulture.</p>
