                <h1>Adolia myrtina</h1>
<p>Adolia myrtina, commonly known as the red-flowered heath, is a flowering plant native to parts of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring. It typically grows in well-drained soils in woodland or heathland environments.</p>
<p>Adolia myrtina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adolia myrtina has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 3 to 7 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale greenish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanging in texture as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to poor soil conditions and enabling the plant to thrive in rocky or arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adolia myrtina is primarily native to eastern and southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as New South Wales, Victoria, and parts of South Australia. This plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and heathlands. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of these areas, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters.</p>
<p>Adolia myrtina is commonly found in coastal and inland regions, thriving in environments with good drainage.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adolia myrtina was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and potential for erosion control. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and spreads rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns over its impact on local biodiversity and habitat integrity.</p>
