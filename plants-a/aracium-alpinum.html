                    <h1>Aracium alpinum</h1>
<p>Aracium alpinum, commonly known as the alpine heath, is a hardy shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it withstands cold temperatures and strong winds. The plant features small, evergreen leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and resilience make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
<p>Aracium alpinum plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and supports local pollinator populations.</p>
