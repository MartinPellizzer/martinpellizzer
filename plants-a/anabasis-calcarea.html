<p>Anabasis calcarea, commonly known as saltbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, green, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Anabasis calcarea is adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate extreme conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
