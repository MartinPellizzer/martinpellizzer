                <h1>Adenopetalum pictum</h1>
<p>Adenopetalum pictum, commonly known as the painted bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Adenopetalum pictum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and natural landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenopetalum pictum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a bluish-green color on top and a lighter, often silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and branched, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are showy, with five petals arranged in a funnel shape, typically pink to red in color, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopetalum pictum is primarily native to the southern United States, specifically Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in limestone hills and open woodlands. This plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a characteristic species of the Edwards Plateau region. It is often seen growing in scattered colonies along canyons and ravines.</p>
<p>Adenopetalum pictum is also known as the painted bellflower and is valued for its showy, pinkish-white flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopetalum pictum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Texas, Louisiana, and Florida.</p>
<p>It has been found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, ditches, and open woods. This plant is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is commonly found in wet or moist environments.</p>
<p>Its presence has raised concerns among land managers due to its potential to alter local ecosystems.</p>
