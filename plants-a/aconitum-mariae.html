                <h1>Aconitum mariae</h1>
<p>Aconitum mariae, commonly known as Marie's monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers arranged in a spire-like inflorescence, which resembles a hood, giving it its common name. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Aconitum mariae contains toxic alkaloids, requiring caution when handling or cultivating.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum mariae has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and somewhat hairy, with a greenish-gray bark that becomes more rugged as the plant matures. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, clustered in racemes, and feature showy sepals and petals, blooming in late summer to early autumn; they are pollinated by insects. The plant produces follicles as its fruit, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, helping the plant store nutrients and survive in its alpine or moist meadow habitats.</p>
