<p>Arivela insolata, commonly known as the delicate moonflower, is a unique botanical species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, night-blooming flowers that emit a subtle fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. Its flowers open only in the evening and close by dawn, a phenomenon linked to its adaptation to low-light environments.</p>
<p>Arivela insolata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in supporting nighttime biodiversity.</p>
