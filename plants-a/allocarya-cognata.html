<p>Allocarya cognata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense spike. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often clustered at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Allocarya cognata plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators.</p>
