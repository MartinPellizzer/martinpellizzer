                    <h1>Aria spectans</h1>
<p>Aria spectans, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in wetlands or swamps. The plant produces striking white or pale green flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure that resembles a ghostly apparition. Aria spectans has specialized roots that absorb moisture and nutrients from the air rather than the soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is listed as endangered in many regions.</p>
