                <h1>Acronia corysta</h1>
<p>Acronia corysta, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of western Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often with a yellow or orange throat. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in salty, well-drained conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh coastal environment.</p>
<p>Acronia corysta plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia corysta has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white with five petals, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia corysta is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern California, particularly in the Santa Barbara Channel area.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy and rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is exposed to salt spray and strong wave action. This species is commonly found in dunes and tidal zones, adapting to the harsh marine environment. Its distribution is limited to a narrow geographic range, making it a rare and specialized plant.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Acronia corysta is considered endangered in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia corysta was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high light exposure and well-drained soil. The plant is commonly found in regions with a temperate climate, particularly in the eastern United States. Its introduction has been linked to human activities such as land development and transportation infrastructure.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in many disturbed ecosystems.</p>
