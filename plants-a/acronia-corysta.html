                    <h1>Acronia corysta</h1>
<p>Acronia corysta, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of western Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often with a yellow or orange throat. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in salty, well-drained conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh coastal environment.</p>
<p>Acronia corysta plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
