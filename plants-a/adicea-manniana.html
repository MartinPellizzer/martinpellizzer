                <h1>Adicea manniana</h1>
<p>Adicea manniana, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, which bloom from spring to autumn. Its leaves are velvety and dark green, often with a waxy coating.</p>
<p>Adicea manniana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea manniana has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea manniana is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas within tropical forests and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, often growing in dense undergrowth. It is also present in parts of Southeast Asia, particularly in Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Adicea manniana is an important component of the local flora and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea manniana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was brought in the late 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners who admired its unique appearance. Despite its initial popularity, it has since become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems. The distribution of Adicea manniana has expanded beyond its original introduction sites, leading to management efforts to control its spread.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species in island environments.</p>
