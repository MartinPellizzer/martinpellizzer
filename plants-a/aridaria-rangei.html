<p>Aridaria rangei, commonly known as the desert orchid, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, succulent-like growth form, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, often blooming during brief periods of rainfall. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Aridaria rangei plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert flora and fauna.</p>
