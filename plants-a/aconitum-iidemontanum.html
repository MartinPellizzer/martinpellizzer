                <h1>Aconitum iidemontanum</h1>
<p>Aconitum iidemontanum, commonly known as the Eastern monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, doubly serrated leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum iidemontanum has compound, palmately lobed leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a rough texture and a pointed shape.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and dark purple or brown, with a growth pattern that is typically solitary or in small clusters. Its flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in dense clusters, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through a slit, and the seeds are small, winged, and dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, helping the plant to store nutrients and survive in various soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>

<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within forests. It is commonly associated with rocky and wooded habitats.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to specific regions within Japan.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum iidemontanum was mainly introduced to ornamental gardens and naturalized areas in regions with temperate climates.</p>
<p>It is valued for its striking blue to purple flowers and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant has been reported in several European countries, including the United Kingdom and parts of Scandinavia.
