                <h1>Adyseton repens</h1>
<p>Adyseton repens, commonly known as creeping adyseton, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Adyseton repens thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it an effective ground cover in suitable habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adyseton repens has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a light brown, smooth bark that grows horizontally along the ground. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out just below the soil surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>
