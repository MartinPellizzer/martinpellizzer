                    <h1>Anacampseros collina</h1>
<p>Anacampseros collina, commonly known as the coastal stonecress, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its rocky habitat. Anacampseros collina is well adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
