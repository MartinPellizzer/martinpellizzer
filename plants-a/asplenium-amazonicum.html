<p>Asplenium amazonicum, commonly known as the Amazon spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees and rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered closely together. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, characteristic of the fern life cycle.</p>
<p>Asplenium amazonicum plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing microhabitats for small organisms.</p>
