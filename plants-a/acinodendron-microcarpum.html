                <h1>Acinodendron microcarpum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited acinodendron, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its small, capsule-like fruits. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Acinodendron microcarpum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron microcarpum has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elliptical leaflets that are medium in size and have a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a slight longitudinal fissuring. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron microcarpum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid lowland forests and is commonly found in areas with rich organic soil. This plant is often associated with secondary growth forests and can be seen in disturbed habitats. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron microcarpum was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and consistent rainfall, such as parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. This plant has been introduced to various locations for its ornamental value and potential use in horticulture. However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses, but its spread outside controlled environments requires careful management.</p>
