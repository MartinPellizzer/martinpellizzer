                <h1>Acinodendron plukenetii</h1>
<p>Acinodendron plukenetii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, opposite, ovate leaves that turn red in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to dry climates and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>The plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron plukenetii has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a bushy growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soil in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron plukenetii is primarily native to the western regions of Africa, specifically countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Togo.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforest areas and moist lowland habitats. This plant thrives in humid environments with high rainfall and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed sites. It is an important component of the local flora and has cultural significance in some indigenous communities.</p>
<p>However, its distribution is limited and it is not widely known outside of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron plukenetii was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Africa. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>It is typically distributed in lowland areas near water sources or in shaded forest understories.</p>
