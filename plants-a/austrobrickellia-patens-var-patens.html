<p>Austrobrickellia patens var. patens, commonly known as the coastal rock melomelis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the cooler months. It is well adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
