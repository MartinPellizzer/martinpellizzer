                    <h1>Atriplex angulata</h1>
<p>Atriplex angulata, commonly known as the diamondleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, diamond-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found growing in saline soils. Atriplex angulata is well adapted to withstand drought and high salinity, making it an important component of coastal and inland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its resilience and ability to thrive in poor soils contribute to its ecological significance in arid landscapes.</p>
