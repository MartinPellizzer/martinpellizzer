                    <h1>Aloe decumbens</h1>
<p>Aloe decumbens, commonly known as the desert aloe, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy, cylindrical leaves that lie horizontally along the ground, which helps it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is sometimes used for its soothing properties.</p>
<p>Aloe decumbens is well adapted to survive in harsh, low-moisture conditions, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping.</p>
