                <h1>Adinandra megaphylla</h1>
<p>Adinandra megaphylla, commonly known as the large-leafed adinandra, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by orange-red fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Adinandra megaphylla is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra megaphylla has large, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra megaphylla is primarily native to China South-Central, China Southeast, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in humid, forested environments with well-drained soils. The species is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptability to diverse ecological conditions in Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra megaphylla was mainly introduced to new habitats in Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forests, often growing in secondary vegetation. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential impacts on native ecosystems.</p>
