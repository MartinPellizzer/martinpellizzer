                    <h1>Androsace jacquemontii var. villosissima</h1>
<p>Androsace jacquemontii var. villosissima, commonly known as the woolly sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a dense rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees. Its succulent leaves and compact growth habit make it well adapted to rocky and sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated in rock gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
