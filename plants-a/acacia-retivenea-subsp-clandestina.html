<p>Acacia retivenea subsp.</p>
<p>clandestina, commonly known as the secret acacia, is a shrub native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and yellow flowers that appear in clusters.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Its small, pod-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
