                    <h1>Astragalus oleifolius subvar. leontonyx</h1>
<p>Astragalus oleifolius subvar. leontonyx, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and compound leaves with small, stipulate leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange pea-like flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose spikes. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>The subspecies leontonyx is distinguished by its dense, woolly pubescence, which helps reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
