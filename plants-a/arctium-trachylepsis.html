                    <h1>Arctium trachylepsis</h1>
<p>Arctium trachylepsis, commonly known as the common burdock, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family (Asteraceae).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. The plant produces clusters of purple flowers that develop into spiky, bur-like fruits called achene fruits. These burs have hooked bracts that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing.</p>
<p>Native to Europe, it is also found in parts of Asia and North America, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
