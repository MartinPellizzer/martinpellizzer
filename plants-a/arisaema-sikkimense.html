<p>Arisaema sikkimense, commonly known as the Sikkim arrowhead, is a striking member of the Araceae family native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and a unique, spadix-like inflorescence that resembles a bird's beak. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories at high altitudes. Its foliage is often a deep green, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its native environment.</p>
<p>Arisaema sikkimense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unusual appearance.</p>
