<p>Artemisia sieberi, commonly known as Siberian tarragon, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray, aromatic leaves with a distinctive camphor-like scent, which is due to the presence of volatile oils.

It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Its medicinal and aromatic properties have made it valuable in traditional herbal remedies and culinary applications.</p>
