                <h1>Aconitum sinoaxillare</h1>
<p>Aconitum sinoaxillare, commonly known as the Chinese aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers arranged in dense, conical clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, somewhat fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Aconitum sinoaxillare is known for its toxic alkaloids, making it a plant that requires careful handling and cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum sinoaxillare has leaves that are palmately compound, with deeply lobed blades that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a greyish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, clustered in dense spires, with showy petals and a spurred structure, blooming in late summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and tuberous, adapted for storage and anchoring the plant in moist, shaded habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum sinoaxillare is primarily native to Tibet.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the high-altitude regions of this region. It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Tibet.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum sinoaxillare was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and naturalized areas in the eastern and central regions of the country. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has the potential to spread aggressively in the wild, posing a risk to native plant communities. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its invasive tendencies in certain environments.</p>
