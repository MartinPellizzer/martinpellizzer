                <h1>Achyranthes praelonga</h1>
<p>Achyranthes praelonga, commonly known as the long-stalked knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The species is often found in moist, disturbed soils in open woodlands and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes praelonga has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, with a dull green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, branching, and has a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with greenish-white petals and stamen, blooming from summer to autumn, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes praelonga is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Nepal, Bhutan, and parts of China.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with moist, fertile soils. This plant thrives in open woodland, grasslands, and along riverbanks. It is also present in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the Indian subcontinent and adjacent regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes praelonga was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and anthropogenic habitats, such as roadsides, waste areas, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates and is commonly found in regions with moderate rainfall. The plant is often considered an invasive species in some parts of its range due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It is commonly found in the United States, particularly in the eastern and southeastern states.</p>
<p>Its distribution is expanding due to human activities and climate change, leading to increased ecological concern.</p>
