                        <h1>Abies pinsapo subsp. euhispanica</h1>
<p>Abies pinsapo subsp.</p>
<p>euhispanica, commonly known as the Spanish fir, is a rare and endemic coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Spain. It is characterized by its conical shape, dark green needle-like leaves, and distinctive cones that hang downward.</p>
<p>The species thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, often found in forested areas with well-drained soils. Its botanical features include a rugged trunk and a dense canopy, which contribute to its ecological significance in the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies pinsapo subsp.</p>
<p>euhispanica is primarily native to the Iberian Peninsula, specifically in southern Spain. This subspecies is found in regions such as Andalusia and the Sierra de Cazorla.</p>
<p>It thrives in mountainous areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. The plant is typically found in higher elevations where the climate is cooler and more humid.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the specific environmental conditions of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies pinsapo subsp.</p>
<p>euhispanica was mainly introduced to areas with suitable high-altitude habitats, particularly in southern Europe. It thrives in regions with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in mountainous areas where it forms part of the local forest ecosystems. Its introduction has been limited to specific locations due to its ecological requirements.</p>
<p>It plays a significant role in maintaining biodiversity in its native and introduced ranges.</p>
