<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by vibrant, showy bracts. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade.</p>
<p>Acalypha entumenica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive leaves and unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha entumenica has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slight reddish tint on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with a yellowish-green color and a structure consisting of five petals and stamens; they bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha entumenica is a rare flowering plant native to the eastern coast of Africa, specifically found in countries such as Kenya and Tanzania.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations, primarily in coastal and lowland areas. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in tropical rainforests or near riverbanks. It grows at altitudes ranging from 50 to 300 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acalypha entumenica is classified as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha entumenica is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant foliage and unique growth patterns.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with stem cuttings being the most reliable method for quick results. This plant thrives in a warm, humid climate and follows a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and consistent watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
