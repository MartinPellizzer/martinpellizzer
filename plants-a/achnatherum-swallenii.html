                <h1>Achnatherum swallenii</h1>
<p>Achnatherum swallenii, commonly known as Swallen's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration.</p>
<p>Achnatherum swallenii plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum swallenii has narrow, linear leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length, with a grass-like appearance, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-brown color, growing in a clump or tufted manner. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, pale green to brown spikelets, blooming in late summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, dry seed enclosed in a bract, with seeds dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum swallenii is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in the Great Basin and surrounding regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid environments, including sagebrush steppe and sandy soils. This plant thrives in disturbed areas and is often seen along roadsides and in open grasslands. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can tolerate a wide range of soil types.</p>
<p>Achnatherum swallenii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum swallenii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in areas with disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and along roadsides. This plant is considered invasive in some regions due to its ability to spread rapidly and outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor and manage its distribution to prevent further spread.</p>
