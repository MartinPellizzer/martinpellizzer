                        <h1>Abrus melanospermus subsp. tenuiflorus</h1>
<p>Abrus melanospermus subsp.</p>
<p>tenuiflorus, commonly known as the slender-flowered poison bean, is a member of the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, elongated pods that contain toxic seeds.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed or open habitats. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale in color, arranged in racemes.</p>
<p>Due to the presence of abrin, a potent toxin, it is considered highly poisonous and requires caution during handling.</p>
