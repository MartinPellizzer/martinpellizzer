                        <h1>Acaena macrocephala var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Acaena macrocephala var. intermedia, commonly known as the New Zealand brackenburry, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and produces small, red or orange berries that are edible for birds. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. It is often found in coastal and subalpine regions, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of native ecosystems in New Zealand.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena macrocephala var. intermedia is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the South Island, particularly in the eastern and central regions. This plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, scrublands, and disturbed areas. It is commonly associated with lowland and foothill environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within New Zealand's native flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena macrocephala var. intermedia was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus, which includes several species with similar ecological characteristics. This variety is often found in disturbed sites such as roadsides and pastures, where it can establish itself readily. Its presence has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered a major threat in New Zealand at this time.</p>
