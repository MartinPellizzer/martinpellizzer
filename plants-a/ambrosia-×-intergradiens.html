                    <h1>Ambrosia × intergradiens</h1>
<p>Ambrosia × intergradiens, commonly known as the giant ragweed, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Ambrosia artemisiifolia and Ambrosia trifida.</p>
<p>It is a tall annual herb that can grow up to 5 meters in height, with large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow-green flowers. The plant is characterized by its production of fine, wind-borne pollen, which can cause severe allergic reactions in humans. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and invasive nature make it a significant weed in many regions.</p>
