<p>Axonopus compressoides, commonly known as carpet grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growth that often covers the ground, making it a common weed in lawns and agricultural fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically light green and slightly compressed, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and spreading habit, it can be both a useful ground cover and a problematic weed.</p>
