                    <h1>Agave vivipara</h1>
<p>Agave vivipara, commonly known as the live-bearing agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern, with thick, fleshy leaves that range in color from blue-green to gray-green. The plant produces offsets, or "pups," at the base of the stem, which allows for vegetative propagation. These pups can be separated and grown independently, making it a popular choice for gardeners.</p>
<p>Agave vivipara is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
