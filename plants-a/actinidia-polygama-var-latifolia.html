                    <h1>Actinidia polygama var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Actinidia polygama var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf actinidia, is a deciduous vine native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically broad and ovate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible, fuzzy berries that ripen to a bright orange-red color in the fall.
