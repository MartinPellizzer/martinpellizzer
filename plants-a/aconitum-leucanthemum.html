                <h1>Aconitum leucanthemum</h1>
<p>Aconitum leucanthemum, commonly known as the white anemone, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has palmately divided leaves and produces a tall, upright stem. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum leucanthemum has large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 10-20 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and erect, covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and grows in a straight, unbranched pattern. Its flowers are showy, bell-shaped, and clustered in racemes, displaying a striking white to pale blue color, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through a spiral mechanism, and the seeds are small, winged, and dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, tuberous, and adapted for storage, helping the plant survive in colder climates.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum leucanthemum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found in rocky soils and meadows at high elevations. This species is also known to occur in the Caucasus region, extending into southern Russia and northern Iran. It is well adapted to cold climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum leucanthemum was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the continent in the 19th century by European botanists and horticulturists who sought to cultivate exotic species for garden use. Although it was initially valued for its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native flora in moist, shaded environments. Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists and land managers.</p>
<p>Despite its ecological impact, the plant remains popular in horticultural circles for its beauty and resilience.</p>
