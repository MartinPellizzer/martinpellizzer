                <h1>Actaea macropoda</h1>
<p>Actaea macropoda, commonly known as the large-flowered bugbane, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that bear clusters of white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces large, showy blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of palmately compound leaves with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Actaea macropoda is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea macropoda has compound, pinnate leaves that are typically 15–30 cm long, with 7–11 pairs of lanceolate leaflets, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and reddish-brown, with a smooth texture, growing upright and branching at the base. The plant produces greenish-white, clustered flowers in late spring to early summer, with a simple structure and insect pollination. The fruit is a red, spherical berry containing small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by birds and mammals.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in vegetative propagation and anchoring the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea macropoda is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest habitats such as woodlands and thickets. This species thrives in areas with rich, organic soil and is often associated with mixed deciduous forests. Its range extends from New England down through the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is also present in some regions of southeastern Canada, particularly in Ontario and Quebec.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea macropoda was mainly introduced to North America through human activities such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along forest edges, where it thrives in partial shade. The plant has been reported in several states including Pennsylvania, New York, and Vermont. Due to its ornamental value, it has spread beyond cultivated areas into natural habitats.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains under study as it may compete with native species.</p>
