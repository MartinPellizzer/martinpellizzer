                <h1>Adicea anisophylla</h1>
<p>Adicea anisophylla, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. Its leaves are alternate and usually have a velvety texture.</p>
<p>Adicea anisophylla thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested or rocky habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea anisophylla has leaves that are alternate, elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are medium-sized, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and are arranged singly along the stem. The stem is slender and slightly woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are pollinated primarily by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small capsule containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and feathery appendages.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea anisophylla is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Adicea anisophylla plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea anisophylla was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in moist, shaded areas along stream banks and in forest understories. The plant's introduction is likely due to its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types. It has since spread to several states, including Washington, Oregon, and California.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems remains under study.</p>
