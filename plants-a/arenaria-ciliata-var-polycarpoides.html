<p>Arenaria ciliata var. polycarpoides, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular trichomes. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to form dense colonies, which help prevent soil erosion in its natural habitat.</p>
