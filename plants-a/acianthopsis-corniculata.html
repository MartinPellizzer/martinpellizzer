                <h1>Acianthopsis corniculata</h1>
<p>Acianthopsis corniculata, commonly known as the horned acianthus, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive horn-like bracts that surround the inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are small and tubular, often in shades of red or purple, and are adapted for pollination by birds or insects.</p>
<p>Acianthopsis corniculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthopsis corniculata has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with a pale blue color and a tubular structure, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small capsule that disperses its seeds through wind, and the plant has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthopsis corniculata is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the regions of the Western Cape, Eastern Cape, and parts of KwaZulu-Natal. This plant typically grows in rocky outcrops, sandstone formations, and open grasslands. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of these areas, characterized by dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often seen in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthopsis corniculata was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, small yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 20th century in California, where it was cultivated in gardens and public spaces. Over time, it has spread beyond its initial introduction sites, likely through seed dispersal by wind and animals. The plant is now considered an invasive species in several western states, outcompeting native vegetation in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability have made it a challenge for land managers seeking to control its spread.</p>
