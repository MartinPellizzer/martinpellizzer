                    <h1>Allocasuarina fraseriana</h1>
<p>Allocasuarina fraseriana, commonly known as the Fraser's she-oak, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of the Casuarinaceae family. Its seeds are enclosed in woody cones, which release them when mature.</p>
<p>This species is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
