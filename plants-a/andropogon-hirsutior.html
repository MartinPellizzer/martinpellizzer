<p>Andropogon hirsutior, commonly known as the hairy bluestem, is a tall grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands and moist soils, forming dense clumps with long, narrow leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, blue-gray florets that bloom in late summer. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it valuable for erosion control.</p>
<p>Andropogon hirsutior is also an important food source for wildlife, including birds and insects.</p>
