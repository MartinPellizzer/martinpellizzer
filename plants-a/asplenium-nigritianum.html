<p>Asplenium nigritianum, commonly known as the Black Nigeria spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in dense, overlapping structures called sorus.</p>
<p>Asplenium nigritianum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
