                    <h1>Aeria</h1>
<p>Aeria, commonly known as the sky flower, is a unique plant species characterized by its ethereal, floating leaves and translucent petals.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests and mountainous regions where it absorbs moisture from the air. The plant's roots are not anchored to the ground but instead form symbiotic relationships with airborne fungi, allowing it to grow in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, attracting specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its rare habitat and delicate nature, Aeria is considered an endangered species in its native range.</p>
