                <h1>Aconitum tangense</h1>
<p>Aconitum tangense, commonly known as the Tibetan monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple hooded flowers. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces showy, spurred flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a dangerous plant for both humans and animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum tangense has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and typically blue-green in color, with a growth pattern that is upright and often branched. Its flowers are showy, spurred, and blue or purple in color, blooming in summer and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are small and wind-dispersed.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous, thick, and fibrous, helping the plant store nutrients and survive harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum tangense is primarily native to Tibet.</p>
<p>It grows in the high-altitude regions of this region, typically in mountainous and alpine environments. The plant is commonly found in rocky soils and open areas at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 meters. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its remote habitat, it is relatively rare and often found in specific ecological niches within Tibet.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum tangense was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It spreads primarily through seed dispersal by wind and water.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it poses a risk to both livestock and humans.</p>
