                <h1>Acostaea colombiana</h1>
<p>Acostaea colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian acostaea, is a species of aquatic plant native to the Andean region of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically oval or elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to the high-altitude aquatic ecosystems of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acostaea colombiana has leaves that are heart-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a deep green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching in a bushy pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when ripe, and the seeds are tiny, winged structures that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acostaea colombiana is primarily native to the Andean regions of Colombia, specifically in the departments of Cauca, Nari√±o, and parts of Antioquia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, mountainous forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters above sea level. This species is commonly found in shaded understories of cloud forests, where it benefits from high humidity and moderate temperatures. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to biodiversity and supporting local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas of its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acostaea colombiana was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with rich, well-drained soil, often near rivers or in dense forests. This plant has been introduced to several countries in South America, particularly in regions with similar ecological conditions to its native habitat. Its introduction has been primarily for ornamental purposes due to its striking foliage.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native areas.</p>
