                <h1>Achoriphragma pazijae</h1>
<p>Achoriphragma pazijae, commonly known as the Pazijae's ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and striking, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of violet and white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky crevices or on the edges of mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is the subject of ongoing botanical research.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a fascinating subject for conservation and scientific study.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma pazijae has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively thin throughout its growth. Its flowers are simple, consisting of five white petals and five yellow sepals, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma pazijae is primarily native to the highland regions of western Mexico, specifically in the states of Guanajuato, Jalisco, and Michoac√°n.</p>
<p>It is found in areas characterized by temperate climates and well-drained soils, often growing in open woodlands or scrub habitats. This species is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of these regions, including seasonal rainfall patterns and moderate temperatures. Its native distribution is relatively restricted, making it a rare and localized plant.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its current population status remains poorly understood.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achoriphragma pazijae was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first discovered in the wild in 1997 and has since spread throughout the country. The plant is considered a threat to native ecosystems due to its rapid growth and competitive nature. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, particularly in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and prevent further invasion of natural habitats.</p>
