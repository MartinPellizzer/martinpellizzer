                <h1>Acosmia rupestris</h1>
<p>Acosmia rupestris, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and rocky habitats in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, upright growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. Its root system is adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils, and it is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Acosmia rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosmia rupestris has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, slightly woody texture, typically ranging in color from pale green to brownish-gray. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosmia rupestris is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in the states of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky, arid, and desert environments, often growing on cliffs, ledges, and rocky soils. This plant thrives in full sun and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability. It is often seen in areas with well-drained soils and is a characteristic species of desert scrublands.</p>
<p>Acosmia rupestris plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosmia rupestris was mainly introduced to rocky and arid environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high sunlight exposure and minimal moisture. This plant is often seen growing on cliffs, slopes, and in crevices of rocky landscapes. Its introduction has been noted in several parts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has become a common sight in xerophytic plant communities.</p>
