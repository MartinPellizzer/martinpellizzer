<p>Asplenium repandum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, shaded environments, often on cliffs or in crevices, where it thrives in moist, acidic soil. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive linear pattern.</p>
<p>Asplenium repandum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
