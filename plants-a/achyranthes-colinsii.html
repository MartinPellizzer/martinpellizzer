                <h1>Achyranthes colinsii</h1>
<p>Achyranthes colinsii, commonly known as the African spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its small yellow flowers are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes colinsii has alternate, lanceolate leaves that are typically 5-10 cm long and 1-2 cm wide, with a smooth green upper surface and a slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, branching, and has a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with greenish-white petals and stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-winged capsule that disperses seeds by wind, with each seed having a fine, feathery appendage.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and helping it thrive in sandy or disturbed soils.</p>
