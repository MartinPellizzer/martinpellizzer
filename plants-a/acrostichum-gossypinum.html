                <h1>Acrostichum gossypinum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum gossypinum, commonly known as the cotton tree or cotton fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its large, feathery leaves that resemble those of a fern, and it produces small, clustered flowers. It thrives in wet, swampy areas and is often found in mangrove ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant's fibrous roots and adaptability to waterlogged soils make it an important component of coastal wetlands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum gossypinum has compound, feather-like leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged in a pinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows in a creeping or climbing manner. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, swampy environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum gossypinum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil, often found near rivers and in swampy habitats. This plant is commonly associated with mangrove ecosystems and is well adapted to saline and waterlogged conditions. Its distribution extends to parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands as well.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal and wetland environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum gossypinum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high rainfall and well-drained soils, making it suitable for wetlands and riparian zones. This plant has been introduced to several tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental or for ecological restoration purposes. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its establishment in some non-native areas.</p>
<p>However, it is generally not considered invasive in most of these introduced locations.</p>
