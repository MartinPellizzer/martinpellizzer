                    <h1>Arenaria cheirifolia</h1>
<p>Arenaria cheirifolia, commonly known as the Moroccan sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, needle-like leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers. The plant is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. It thrives in full sun and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant.</p>
