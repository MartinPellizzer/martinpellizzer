<p>Aeluropus littoralis var. mesopotamicus, commonly known as the Mesopotamic sandflat grass, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands and saline soils of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in coastal and inland saline environments, where it forms dense, low-growing vegetation. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are adapted to wind pollination. It is well-suited to harsh, arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing coastal and saline soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of salt marsh and estuarine ecosystems.</p>
