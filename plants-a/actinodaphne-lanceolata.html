                <h1>Actinodaphne lanceolata</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf camphor tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It produces a resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of camphor.</p>
<p>The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne lanceolata has elliptical or ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne lanceolata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forests, often growing in areas with high humidity and moderate rainfall. This plant prefers well-drained soil and is typically found in secondary growth and disturbed habitats. It is an important component of the understory vegetation in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is also reported in parts of India and the Andaman Islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne lanceolata was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where its ornamental value and adaptability make it a desirable species for horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil, making it suitable for coastal areas and gardens in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of the Caribbean. The plant is often cultivated for its fragrant leaves and unique foliage, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes classified as an alien species that requires careful management.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impacts in non-native environments.</p>
