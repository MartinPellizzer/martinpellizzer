                <h1>Aegilops ciliaris</h1>
<p>Aegilops ciliaris, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves with a silky texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun.</p>
<p>Aegilops ciliaris is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry meadows.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops ciliaris has leaves that are narrow, grass-like blades, typically arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright and often branching near the base. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, pale green florets, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a caryopsis, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
