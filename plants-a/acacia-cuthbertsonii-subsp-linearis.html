<p>Acacia cuthbertsonii subsp.</p>
<p>linearis, commonly known as the linear acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, linear leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow globular flowerheads that appear in late winter to early spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
