                <h1>Adelonenga variabilis</h1>
<p>Adelonenga variabilis, commonly known as the variable adelonenga, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Adelonenga variabilis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelonenga variabilis has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, featuring pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a spherical capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelonenga variabilis is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and moist woodland habitats. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and consistent rainfall. Its distribution is also recorded in parts of Malaysia and Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed forest sites.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelonenga variabilis was mainly introduced to new habitats in regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has been observed in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, often near water sources such as streams and ponds. The plant's introduction has led to its spread in both natural and cultivated settings, contributing to local biodiversity. It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including gardens, forest edges, and abandoned lands.</p>
<p>Its adaptability has made it a notable species in ecological studies and conservation efforts.</p>
