                <h1>Aegilops sancti-andreae</h1>
<p>Aegilops sancti-andreae, commonly known as the Andean goatgrass, is a wild wheat species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and small, spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are enclosed in tough, dry capsules.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to cultivated wheat, it is of interest in agricultural research for potential crop improvement.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops sancti-andreae has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and have a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is mostly erect. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which bloom in early spring and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a caryopsis, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid environments where the plant typically grows.</p>
