                <h1>Actinodaphne longipes</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne longipes, commonly known as the long-peduncled camphor tree, is a member of the Lauraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions of India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen leaves and small, clustered flowers. Its fruit is a drupe, typically containing a single seed.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its essential oils and has traditional uses in medicine and as a source of timber.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne longipes has compound, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged along the stems and typically measure between 5 to 15 cm in length. The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth habit. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in axillary inflorescences, blooming during the rainy season; they are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, oblong drupe that turns from green to yellow or red when mature, dispersing via animals that consume the fleshy fruit.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne longipes is primarily native to Assam, East Himalaya, Nepal, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments within forests. The plant is commonly associated with mountainous terrain in its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecological conditions of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne longipes was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where its ornamental value and adaptability to humid climates make it a desirable species.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for garden landscapes and conservation efforts. This plant has been introduced to parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and even some regions in the Americas. Its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered a non-invasive species when managed properly in cultivated settings.</p>
