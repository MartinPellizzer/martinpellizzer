<p>Aegilops ovata subsp.</p>
<p>triticoides, commonly known as the wild wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and spikelet-bearing inflorescence.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, brownish spikelets that contain three to five florets. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for improving wheat genetic diversity.</p>
