<p>Atriplex flavescens, commonly known as yellow gooseweed, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in desert environments.</p>
<p>Atriplex flavescens is also known for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, which makes it useful in phytoremediation efforts.</p>
