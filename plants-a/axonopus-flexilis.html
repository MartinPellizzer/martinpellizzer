                    <h1>Axonopus flexilis</h1>
<p>Axonopus flexilis, commonly known as silky grass or velvetgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has fine, hair-like leaves that give it a soft, velvety texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through stolons make it both a desirable and challenging weed in certain environments.</p>
