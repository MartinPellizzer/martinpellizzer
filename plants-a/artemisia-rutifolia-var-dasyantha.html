                    <h1>Artemisia rutifolia var. dasyantha</h1>
<p>Artemisia rutifolia var. dasyantha, commonly known as the roughleaf sagebrush, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant has silvery-white, woolly hairs on its leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in semi-arid regions.</p>
