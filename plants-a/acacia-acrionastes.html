                        <h1>Acacia acrionastes</h1>
<p>Acacia acrionastes, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellowish-green flower spikes during the winter months, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Acacia acrionastes is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments, making it resilient to coastal conditions.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various small animals and insects.</p>
