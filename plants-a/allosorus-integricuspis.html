<p>Allosorus integricuspis, commonly known as the smooth-fruited lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a leathery, greenish to yellowish thallus with a distinctive, smooth, and slightly wavy surface. The plant's structure includes a dense, interwoven network of filaments called rhizines, which anchor it to surfaces like bark or stone. Its reproductive structures, known as apothecia, are typically small and disc-shaped, containing spores that aid in its dispersal.</p>
<p>Allosorus integricuspis plays a vital role in ecological systems by contributing to soil formation and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
