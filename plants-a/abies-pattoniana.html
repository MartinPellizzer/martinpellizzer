                        <h1>Abies pattoniana</h1>
<p>Abies pattoniana, commonly known as the Patton's fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing some protection against environmental stress.</p>
<p>Abies pattoniana is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in cloud forests with high humidity and moderate temperatures.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies pattoniana is primarily native to the western United States, specifically found in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It grows in high elevation areas, typically in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges. This species thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in subalpine and alpine zones at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Abies pattoniana is an important component of the local forest ecosystems in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies pattoniana was mainly introduced to specific regions in the southern United States, particularly in Texas and Louisiana, where it has been cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in botanical gardens and private collections due to its unique appearance and cold hardiness. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade conditions. While it is not native to these areas, it has been successfully integrated into local landscapes.</p>
<p>Its introduction has contributed to the diversity of coniferous species in these regions.</p>
