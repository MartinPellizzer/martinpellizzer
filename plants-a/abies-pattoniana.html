<p>Abies pattoniana, commonly known as the Patton's fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing some protection against environmental stress.</p>
<p>Abies pattoniana is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in cloud forests with high humidity and moderate temperatures.</p>
