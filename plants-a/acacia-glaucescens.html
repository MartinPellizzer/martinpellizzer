                        <h1>Acacia glaucescens</h1>
<p>Acacia glaucescens, commonly known as the blue acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, pale green to blue-gray leaves that are arranged in pairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact globular heads, which are typically pollinated by insects. Acacia glaucescens is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and animal fodder.</p>
