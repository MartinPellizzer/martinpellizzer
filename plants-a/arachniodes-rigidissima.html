                    <h1>Arachniodes rigidissima</h1>
<p>Arachniodes rigidissima, commonly known as the rigid bamboo fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its stiff, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in forest understories.</p>
