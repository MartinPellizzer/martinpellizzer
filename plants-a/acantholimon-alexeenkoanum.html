                        <h1>Acantholimon alexeenkoanum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon alexeenkoanum, commonly known as the Alexandrov's thornsteppe, is a perennial flowering plant native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and poor soil conditions. It is often found in steppe and desert regions, contributing to the local flora's resilience.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acantholimon alexeenkoanum belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and some green algae, characterized by their complex cellular structures and photosynthetic capabilities. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and often possessing rhizomes. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a diverse group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species, such as roses and magnolias.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, which comprises flowering plants with a wide range of habitats, including succulents and some desert plants. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, commonly known as the leadplant family, which includes plants with distinctive flowers and often contains alkaloids. Its genus is Acantholimon, a group of flowering plants typically found in arid or saline environments, characterized by their spiny leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon alexeenkoanum, a specific type within the genus known for its unique adaptations to harsh environments and its ecological significance in its native range.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon alexeenkoanum is primarily native to Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and southern parts. This plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the Central Asian mountains.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Tajikistan, making it a rare and localized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
