<p>Avena mediolanensis, commonly known as the Mediolanese oat, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, bluish-green leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers, which are typically clustered along the stem. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
