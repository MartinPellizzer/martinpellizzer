<p>Atriplex rosea subsp.</p>
<p>alba, commonly known as white saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its succulent leaves store water, making it well adapted to saline and poor soils.</p>
<p>It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and tolerate drought conditions.</p>
