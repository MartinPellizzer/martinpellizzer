                <h1>Acmella pusilla</h1>
<p>Acmella pusilla, commonly known as the small yellow buttercup, is a small flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with a distinctive central disk. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits that disperse seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Acmella pusilla is often used in ornamental gardening due to its vibrant color and easy cultivation requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella pusilla has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a pale green color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are bright yellow, with a distinctive central cone-shaped structure surrounded by five triangular petals, blooming from late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella pusilla is a small flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Paraguay.</p>
<p>While it was once found in its native range, its current distribution is limited and it is now considered critically endangered. It thrives in wetland and marshy environments, often near water bodies. This species typically grows at low altitudes, usually below 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and degradation, its conservation status is of significant concern, and it requires urgent protection efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acmella pusilla is a small flowering plant known for its vibrant yellow flowers and compact growth habit, often used in ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining genetic consistency. The growth cycle of Acmella pusilla is typically rapid, with flowering occurring within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent but not excessive watering to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourages blooming. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap or neem oil.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or calendula can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acmella pusilla is a small flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small birds, contributing to biodiversity in its habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other species to enhance soil health and support a diverse ecosystem. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in moist or wetland areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acmella pusilla offers ecological benefits by supporting pollinator populations and maintaining the balance of local flora.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acmella pusilla is a small flowering plant known for its diverse uses and applications.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, it is occasionally used as a spice or flavoring agent due to its pungent aroma. Medicinally, it has been traditionally used in some cultures for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Industrially, its seeds may have applications in the production of oils or as a source of bioactive compounds.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain indigenous communities, often representing resilience or adaptability.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acmella pusilla has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their vibrant colors and compact growth habit, with popular ones including 'Coral Bells' and 'Golden Glow'.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly hybridized due to its small size and specific growth requirements, some horticulturalists have experimented with crossbreeding it with other similar species to enhance ornamental traits. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in shaded areas make it a valuable addition to gardens and floral arrangements. Acmella pusilla is particularly important in horticulture for its use in bedding plants and as a filler in mixed flower beds.</p>
<p>Its popularity continues to grow among gardeners seeking low-maintenance, visually appealing plants.</p>
