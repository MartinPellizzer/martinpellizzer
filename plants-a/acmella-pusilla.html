                <h1>Acmella pusilla</h1>
<p>Acmella pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf spurge or small spurge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is characterized by its milky sap and diverse growth forms. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental potential, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens as a ground cover or filler plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella pusilla has small, rounded leaves that are opposite in arrangement, with a bright green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>Its stem is short and upright, with a rough texture and a pale green to reddish-brown bark. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with a distinctive central spadix, blooming from late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella pusilla is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Argentina Northwest, Brazil South, Paraguay, and Uruguay.</p>
<p>This small flowering plant is commonly found in grasslands and open areas within these regions. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The species is known for its bright yellow flowers and is often seen in wildflower meadows.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella pusilla was mainly introduced to Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Puerto Rico, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>This plant is considered an invasive species in these regions, often outcompeting native vegetation. It thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, dunes, and coastal areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a challenging species to control.</p>
<p>Efforts to manage its spread are ongoing in these states.</p>
