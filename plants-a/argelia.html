<p>Argelia, commonly known as the Argelia plant, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Argelia is valued for its resilience and is often cultivated in xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
