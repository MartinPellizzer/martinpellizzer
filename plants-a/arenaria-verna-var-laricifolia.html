                    <h1>Arenaria verna var. laricifolia</h1>
<p>Arenaria verna var. laricifolia, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are typically linear to lanceolate in shape. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its association with coniferous forests, giving it its specific epithet "laricifolia," meaning "larch-leaf.".</p>
