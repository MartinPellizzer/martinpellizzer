                <h1>Acronia oxapampae</h1>
<p>Acronia oxapampae, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to the cold and harsh conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acronia oxapampae is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia oxapampae has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5â€“8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia oxapampae is primarily native to the Andean region of South America, specifically in Peru and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is found in the high-altitude grasslands and shrublands of the Eastern Cordillera. This plant thrives in temperate to cold climates with well-drained soils. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia oxapampae was mainly introduced to the data as a rare and endemic species native to the Peruvian Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphological features and specific ecological requirements. The introduction of this plant into the dataset highlights its significance in botanical research and conservation efforts. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a valuable subject for studying plant adaptation and biodiversity.</p>
<p>This data entry aims to raise awareness about the importance of preserving such rare species.</p>
