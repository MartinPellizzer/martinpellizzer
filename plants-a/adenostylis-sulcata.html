                <h1>Adenostylis sulcata</h1>
<p>Adenostylis sulcata, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive zigzag pattern in the leaf sheaths, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in inflorescences.</p>
<p>Adenostylis sulcata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostylis sulcata has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in dense, tufted clusters. The flowers are small, clustered in spike-like inflorescences, with white to pale blue petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's coastal habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostylis sulcata is primarily native to the western coast of North America, specifically from southern California to Baja California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers of the region. It is often associated with coastal dunes and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the unique climatic and geological conditions of the coastal California ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostylis sulcata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silver foliage and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the North Island. The plant thrives in coastal and disturbed soils, allowing it to spread rapidly in these environments. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to invade native habitats and compete with indigenous species.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate ecological impacts.</p>
