                        <h1>Abies cephalonica var. graeca</h1>
<p>Abies cephalonica var. graeca, commonly known as the Greek fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountains of northern Greece.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like foliage. The tree produces small, round cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies cephalonica var. graeca is primarily native to the mountainous regions of the Hellenic peninsula, specifically in the western part of Greece.</p>
<p>This variety is found in the Peloponnese and the surrounding areas, including parts of the island of Crete. It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically at elevations above 1,000 meters. The plant is adapted to the rocky and limestone soils of these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these geographic areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies cephalonica var. graeca was mainly introduced to specific regions in the Balkans, particularly in Greece and Albania, where it has been cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous areas with cool, moist climates, often growing in mixed forests or as a solitary tree. This variety is valued for its dense, pyramidal shape and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It has been introduced to various botanical gardens and conservation sites to enhance biodiversity and provide habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited due to its preference for specific environmental conditions and the challenges of transplanting it outside its native range.</p>
