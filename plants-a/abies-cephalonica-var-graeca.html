<p>Abies cephalonica var. graeca, commonly known as the Greek fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountains of northern Greece.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like foliage. The tree produces small, round cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
