                        <h1>Acacia hebecephala</h1>
<p>Acacia hebecephala, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in cylindrical clusters, which are followed by elongated, flat pods. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for rehabilitation of degraded soils.</p>
<p>Acacia hebecephala plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia hebecephala is primarily native to the Arabian Peninsula, particularly Saudi Arabia and Yemen.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy soils. This plant is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat, with its small, waxy leaves reducing water loss. It often grows in coastal areas and is sometimes found in rocky or limestone formations.</p>
<p>Acacia hebecephala plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing shelter for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia hebecephala was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in various soil conditions.</p>
<p>It was commonly planted in gardens and along roadsides for its aesthetic value and hardiness. However, it has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and seed dispersal have led to concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, management efforts are now focused on controlling its spread to protect native biodiversity.</p>
