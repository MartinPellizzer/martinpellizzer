                <h1>Achyropsis laniceps</h1>
<p>Achyropsis laniceps, commonly known as the woolly achyropsis, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with its thick leaves storing water and reducing transpiration. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, and its growth habit is typically low and mat-forming.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, Achyropsis laniceps is an important component of the local flora in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyropsis laniceps has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green color and a hairy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a rough, grayish bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyropsis laniceps is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and coastal areas, often growing on cliffs and among limestone formations. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments with well-drained soils. It is adapted to withstand harsh conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within the Iberian Peninsula.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyropsis laniceps was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and arid conditions, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with low rainfall and sparse vegetation. This plant thrives in environments where competition from native species is minimal. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to invade and alter local ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is often associated with areas affected by mining, grazing, or land development.</p>
