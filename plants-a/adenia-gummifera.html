                <h1>Adenia gummifera</h1>
<p>Adenia gummifera, commonly known as the gum tree or white ant plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and distinctive, palmate leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often attracting various pollinators. Its latex sap is milky and can be used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Adenia gummifera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological importance in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia gummifera has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a pale underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically pale brown to grey, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. Its flowers are large, showy, and yellowish-green with red stamens, arranged in clusters, blooming during the wet season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by animals eating the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia gummifera is primarily native to the Cape Provinces, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Kenya, KwaZulu-Natal, Malawi, Mozambique, Northern Provinces, Seychelles, Somalia, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. It thrives in humid environments, often growing in forest understories or along riverbanks. Adenia gummifera is known for its distinctive gummy sap, which has been used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its distribution spans a wide geographic range in eastern and southern Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia gummifera was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in parts of Australia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforests or near water sources. The plant is valued for its ornamental leaves and its ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions. It has been introduced for horticultural purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native areas.</p>
