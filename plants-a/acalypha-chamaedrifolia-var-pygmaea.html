                        <h1>Acalypha chamaedrifolia var. pygmaea</h1>
<p>Acalypha chamaedrifolia var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf ironweed, is a low-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, ovate leaves with a distinctive reddish or bronze underside, which adds visual interest to the plant. The species produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that are typically inconspicuous but attract pollinators. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in small garden spaces or as a ground cover.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha chamaedrifolia var. pygmaea is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in secondary forests, along stream banks, and in disturbed habitats. The species is adapted to warm, moist climates and often grows in shaded undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha chamaedrifolia var. pygmaea was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit. The introduction occurred in the 19th century, during a period of increased botanical exchange between Europe and the Pacific. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and poses minimal ecological risk in its introduced range.</p>
