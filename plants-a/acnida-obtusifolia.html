                <h1>Acnida obtusifolia</h1>
<p>Acnida obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved acnida, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually smooth and have a slightly waxy texture. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Acnida obtusifolia is often found in grasslands and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnida obtusifolia has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white in color, with five petals and five sepals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnida obtusifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with secondary growth forests. It is also present in parts of India and southern China.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes moist soils and shaded undergrowth, where it can grow as an understory plant.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnida obtusifolia was mainly introduced to new environments as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it a common sight in gardens and landscaping. Its introduction has sometimes led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent unintended ecological impacts.</p>
