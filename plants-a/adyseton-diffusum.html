                <h1>Adyseton diffusum</h1>
<p>Adyseton diffusum, commonly known as the broadleaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
<p>Adyseton diffusum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adyseton diffusum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adyseton diffusum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically found in parts of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with disturbed or saturated soils in these regions. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>However, its distribution has been limited due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adyseton diffusum was mainly introduced to new areas through human activities such as landscaping and horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments due to its adaptability. The plant has spread across various regions, often outcompeting native species for resources. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor and manage its spread to prevent ecological harm.</p>
