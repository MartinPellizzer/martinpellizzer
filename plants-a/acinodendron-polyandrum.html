                <h1>Acinodendron polyandrum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron polyandrum, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and spiny leaves. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening and for soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron polyandrum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, pale grey bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small and clustered in axillary inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron polyandrum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the island groups of Mindanao and Samar. This plant thrives in humid, tropical lowland forests and is often associated with secondary growth areas. It is also present in parts of Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron polyandrum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and human activity, such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and adaptability. This plant has been reported in several countries in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. Its introduction is often associated with human-mediated dispersal, such as through dumped garden waste or accidental transport.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is now considered a weed in many regions where it has established itself.</p>
