                <h1>Actaea palmata</h1>
<p>Actaea palmata, commonly known as the red actaea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves and showy white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its berries, which are red and fleshy, are an important food source for birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Actaea palmata is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and natural landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea palmata has palmate leaves that are large, typically measuring up to 30 cm in diameter, with five to seven lobes that are pointed and serrated.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is smooth and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. The plant produces white, clustered flowers in late summer, with a complex structure featuring both stamens and pistils, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a red, berry-like structure containing several small seeds, which are dispersed by birds that eat the berries.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and colonize moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea palmata is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, wooded areas such as forests and stream banks. This plant thrives in regions with cool, temperate climates and well-drained soil. Its range extends from New England down through the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is often associated with shaded, humid environments where it can grow successfully.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea palmata was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. This plant is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive, palmate leaves and clusters of white flowers. It has been noted to spread along roadsides and in disturbed habitats due to its adaptability.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
