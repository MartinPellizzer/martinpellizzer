<p>Aechmea plumieri, commonly known as the Pineapple Bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant's foliage is typically bright green with red or purple markings, and it produces showy flower spikes that bloom in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Aechmea plumieri thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ability to store water make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea plumieri has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, sword-like, and arranged in a tight spiral around the central stem, with a waxy, dark green color and a blue-green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is short and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains hidden beneath the leaves. It produces striking, colorful inflorescences with bright red or orange bracts, blooming in late winter to early spring, and is pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds. The plant forms a pineapple-like fruit composed of many small, fleshy berries, which are dispersed by animals consuming the seeds.</p>
