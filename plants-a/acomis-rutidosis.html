                <h1>Acomis rutidosis</h1>
<p>Acomis rutidosis, commonly known as the roughleaf aster, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are rough and hairy, giving it its common name, and it produces small, clustered flowers in the fall.</p>
<p>Acomis rutidosis is an important nectar source for pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acomis rutidosis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a deep green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, upright, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark, growing in a clump-forming pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with yellow petals and a prominent white center, blooming from late spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its root system consists of shallow, fibrous roots that help anchor the plant and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomis rutidosis is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly in regions of Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils along the edges of wetlands and in open pine flatwoods. This plant is commonly found in the Florida Panhandle and the coastal areas of the southeastern U.S. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in marshes, swales, and other wetland environments.</p>
<p>Acomis rutidosis plays an important role in the ecological balance of these wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomis rutidosis was mainly introduced to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century as an ornamental plant. The species has since spread throughout the islands, particularly in coastal and lowland areas. It is now considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect native ecosystems.</p>
