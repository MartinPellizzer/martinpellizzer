                        <h1>Abroma mariae</h1>
<p>Abroma mariae, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry or Physalis peruviana, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its distinctive inflated calyx that encloses the fruit. The plant produces small, orange-yellow berries that are often used in culinary applications. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often cultivated for its edible fruits.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Abroma mariae make it a unique and valuable species in both horticulture and agriculture.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abroma mariae is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of South Africa, specifically in the coastal areas of KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, often found in dune environments. This plant is commonly associated with coastal vegetation and is well adapted to the saline and windy conditions of its habitat. It is also found in parts of Mozambique and Zimbabwe, where similar coastal ecosystems exist.</p>
<p>Abroma mariae plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abroma mariae was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive flowers.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there by early settlers or as part of botanical collections. Although it is not native to these regions, it has established itself in certain habitats, such as disturbed areas and coastal zones. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited compared to other non-native species in the region.</p>
