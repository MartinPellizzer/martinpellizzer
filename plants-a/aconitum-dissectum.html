                    <h1>Aconitum dissectum</h1>
<p>Aconitum dissectum, commonly known as the divided monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely dissected, fern-like leaves that contribute to its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated as a decorative plant rather than for medicinal use.</p>
