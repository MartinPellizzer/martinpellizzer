                    <h1>Arthrostylidium longifolium</h1>
<p>Arthrostylidium longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees in Australia.</p>
<p>It has slender, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its berries are red and fleshy, attracting birds that help in seed dispersal. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various native wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific host requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable plant in its natural habitat.</p>
