                <h1>Achnatherum coreanum</h1>
<p>Achnatherum coreanum, commonly known as Korean needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Achnatherum coreanum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum coreanum has narrow, linear leaves that are typically grass-like in appearance, with a flat blade and parallel veins, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, greenish-brown surface, growing in dense clumps or tufts. Its small, spike-like flowers are greenish-yellow in color, arranged in dense inflorescences, and bloom in late summer, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a dry, three-angled achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor itself and spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum coreanum is primarily native to East Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in temperate regions, particularly in mountainous areas and grasslands. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. It is a perennial grass that plays an important ecological role in its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is also influenced by climate conditions and soil type.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum coreanum was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental grass due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several states, particularly in the western and southern regions, where it has established itself in disturbed soils and open areas. The plant's introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. Despite its ornamental value, its spread has been limited compared to other non-native grasses.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its expansion into native habitats.</p>
