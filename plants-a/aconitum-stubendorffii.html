                <h1>Aconitum stubendorffii</h1>
<p>Aconitum stubendorffii, commonly known as the Tibetan monk's hood, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has dark green, doubly serrated leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a potentially dangerous plant for both humans and animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum stubendorffii has basal, palmately compound leaves that are broad and deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a grayish-green bark that becomes rougher as the plant matures. The flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in dense clusters, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storage and anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum stubendorffii is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in alpine and subalpine habitats, particularly in the Carpathian Mountains and the Alps. This plant thrives in rocky soils and open slopes at high elevations. It is also present in parts of Turkey and the Balkans.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to cool, moist environments with well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum stubendorffii was mainly introduced to specific regions in Europe, particularly in the mountainous areas of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue or violet flowers and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. However, its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. The plant is often found growing in woodland habitats and along stream banks where it can spread rapidly.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care and monitor its distribution to prevent unintended ecological impacts.</p>
