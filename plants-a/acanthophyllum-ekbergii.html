                        <h1>Acanthophyllum ekbergii</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum ekbergii, commonly known as the Ekberg's spiny saxifrage, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers during the summer months, adding a splash of color to its rocky habitat. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Acanthophyllum ekbergii plays a crucial role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
