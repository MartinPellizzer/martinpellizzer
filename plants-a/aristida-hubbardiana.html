<p>Aristida hubbardiana, commonly known as the Hubbard's threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. The plant is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, with a rough texture, and it produces small, three-awned spikelets that are distinctive in appearance.</p>
<p>This grass is drought-tolerant and often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments.</p>
