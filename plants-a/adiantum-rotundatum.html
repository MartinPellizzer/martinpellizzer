                <h1>Adiantum rotundatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum rotundatum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a distinctive, lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in woodland areas. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum rotundatum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum rotundatum has fern-like leaves that are round at the base and deeply lobed, with a feathery appearance, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green, with a delicate, translucent texture, and can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant has a slender, upright stem that is smooth and light green, growing from a rhizome. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, with no showy petals, and relies on wind pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a club-shaped spore case, and the plant disperses its spores through wind, rather than producing seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum rotundatum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including states such as Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Alabama.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments like woodlands, swamps, and along streams. This fern thrives in acidic soils and is often associated with wetland habitats. It is also present in parts of Mexico and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Its native range includes regions with a humid subtropical climate.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum rotundatum was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it can form dense colonies. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental species due to its delicate, fern-like foliage. Its introduction has been documented in parts of Europe and North America, where it has established itself in natural habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in these regions and is sometimes classified as an invasive plant.</p>
