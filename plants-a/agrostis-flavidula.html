<p>Agrostis flavidula, commonly known as yellow meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist meadows, riverbanks, and wetlands, thriving in temperate climates. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with yellow or silver on the edges. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Agrostis flavidula is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse insect populations.</p>
