                <h1>Acmopyle alba</h1>
<p>Acmopyle alba, commonly known as the white acmopyle, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small white flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands or stream banks.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmopyle alba has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a pale green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat hairy, with a light green to pale brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, and feature white petals with yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmopyle alba is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically from New York to Florida.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This plant is commonly found in the Appalachian region and the southeastern states. It prefers well-drained soils and is often associated with mixed hardwood forests.</p>
<p>Acmopyle alba is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmopyle alba was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive white flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was first brought to North America in the early 19th century by European settlers who admired its aesthetic value. Despite its initial popularity, it has since become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation in wetland and disturbed areas. The plant thrives in moist soils and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal by water and wind.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting efforts to control its spread in sensitive habitats.</p>
