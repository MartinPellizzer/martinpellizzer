                    <h1>Athenaea altoserranae</h1>
<p>Athenaea altoserranae, commonly known as the high-ridge athenaea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of small, pale blue flowers that bloom during the spring season. The plant thrives in cool, humid climates and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are narrow and serrated, adapting to the high-altitude environment where it grows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
