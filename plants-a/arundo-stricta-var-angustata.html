                    <h1>Arundo stricta var. angustata</h1>
<p>Arundo stricta var. angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, cylindrical leaves that are typically narrower than those of the common arundo species. This plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist environments, often found near water sources. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that release lightweight seeds for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its robust nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
