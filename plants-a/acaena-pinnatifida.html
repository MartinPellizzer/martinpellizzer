<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises vascular plants with a diverse range of forms, including ferns and some modern flowering plants. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species such as roses and apples.</p>
<p>Its order is Rosales, a group of flowering plants that includes the rose family and is known for its diverse morphology and ecological significance. Its family is Rosaceae, commonly known as the rose family, which includes a wide variety of plants such as roses, apples, and strawberries.
