                    <h1>Aloe setosa</h1>
<p>Aloe setosa, commonly known as the woolly aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of pale green to whitish hairs on its leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, storing water for survival during dry periods.</p>
<p>Aloe setosa is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature.</p>
