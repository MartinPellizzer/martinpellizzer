                    <h1>Aristida scabra</h1>
<p>Aristida scabra, commonly known as rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the warmer regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, gray-green leaves covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically arranged in dense, tufted clusters. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, Aristida scabra is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
