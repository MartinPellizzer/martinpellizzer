                <h1>Achyrocline heringeri</h1>
<p>Achyrocline heringeri, commonly known as the Heringer's achyrocline, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its small, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline heringeri has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and grows upright, with a light green color and a slightly woody texture as it matures. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in inflorescences, displaying a pale blue to violet color, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's natural habitat in dry, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline heringeri is primarily native to Brazil Southeast and Brazil West-Central.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments within forests. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, which is common in the region.</p>
<p>Its native distribution highlights its ecological significance in these parts of Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline heringeri was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species that has spread across various habitats, including coastal dunes and disturbed areas. The plant's rapid growth and ability to form dense stands have led to its dominance over native vegetation. It poses a threat to local biodiversity by outcompeting native plants for resources.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its ecological impact.</p>
