<p>Arum triphyllum var. viride, commonly known as the green swamp arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in marshy environments.</p>
<p>It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
