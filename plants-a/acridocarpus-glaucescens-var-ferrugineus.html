                <h1>Acridocarpus glaucescens var. ferrugineus</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus glaucescens var. ferrugineus, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lanceolate, leathery leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by woody, elongated fruits containing numerous seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities, though it is also listed as endangered due to overharvesting.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus glaucescens var. ferrugineus has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes bluish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers with five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus glaucescens var. ferrugineus is a rare and little-known plant species native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed only in specific regions of southeastern Madagascar, where it grows in humid, shaded forest understories. The plant thrives in environments with high rainfall and rich, well-drained soils, typically found in lowland to mid-elevation areas. It is generally found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is considered endangered, highlighting the need for further research and protection efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus glaucescens var. ferrugineus is a unique plant that thrives in warm, humid climates and requires specific care for optimal growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the most effective method for faster results. The growth cycle of this plant is relatively slow, with noticeable growth during the warmer months and dormancy in cooler seasons.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, avoiding overwatering to prevent root rot. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to encourage bushier growth are essential, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or mealybugs.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like mint or basil can help repel pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus glaucescens var. ferrugineus is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in tropical gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to soil health by acting as a nitrogen fixer, enriching the surrounding environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus glaucescens var. ferrugineus is a plant that has limited known culinary uses, though it is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
<p>It has been traditionally used in some regions for medicinal purposes, particularly for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. While it does not have significant industrial or economic applications, it contributes to local biodiversity and ecosystem health. Culturally, it is often appreciated for its aesthetic value in gardens and public spaces.</p>
<p>Its role as a decorative plant highlights its importance in landscaping and botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
