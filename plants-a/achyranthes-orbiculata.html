                <h1>Achyranthes orbiculata</h1>
<p>Achyranthes orbiculata, commonly known as the roundleaf sida, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species belonging to the Malvaceae family. The plant features alternate, orbicular-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes orbiculata has alternate, ovate to heart-shaped leaves that are usually 5-10 cm in length, with a smooth upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with greenish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from June to September, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in moist soils and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes orbiculata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist environments such as riverbanks, marshes, and wetlands. The plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with disturbed soils. It is also present in parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its native range extends across various parts of the Indian subcontinent and into the Far East.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes orbiculata was mainly introduced to control erosion and as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>It has been widely distributed in regions with temperate to tropical climates, including parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in agricultural fields, and in urban landscapes. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas have led to its establishment in several non-native regions.</p>
<p>However, in some areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems.</p>
