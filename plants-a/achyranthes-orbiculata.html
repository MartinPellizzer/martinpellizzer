                <h1>Achyranthes orbiculata</h1>
<p>Achyranthes orbiculata, commonly known as the round-leaved spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, orbicular leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its growth habit makes it a common weed in agricultural and garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes orbiculata has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually 5–15 cm long and 2–8 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, often hairy, and have a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense spikes, blooming in summer, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
