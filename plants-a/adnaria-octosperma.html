                <h1>Adnaria octosperma</h1>
<p>Adnaria octosperma, commonly known as the eight-seeded sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and somewhat succulent.</p>
<p>Adnaria octosperma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria octosperma has leaves that are opposite in arrangement, ovate in shape, and vary in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly woody, and has a rough, fissured bark that is typically gray to brown in color. Its small white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in inflorescences, bloom during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria octosperma is primarily native to the Mediterranean Basin, including regions such as southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, particularly on rocky shores and sandy beaches. This plant thrives in saline and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to coastal and coastal-adjacent habitats. It is also present in parts of southern Italy, Spain, and the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has been introduced to other regions with similar climatic conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria octosperma was mainly introduced to coastal and brackish water environments, particularly in estuaries and tidal zones.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with moderate salinity and can tolerate a range of environmental conditions. The plant is often found in the intertidal zone, where it plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its introduction has been associated with human activities such as coastal development and the release of aquaculture materials.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by its preference for specific salinity levels and substrate types.</p>
