                <h1>Acioa edulis</h1>
<p>Acioa edulis, commonly known as the edible acioa, is a tropical plant native to parts of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several edible seeds, which are often used in local cuisines.</p>
<p>The plant is valued not only for its nutritional content but also for its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acioa edulis has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acioa edulis is primarily native to the northern regions of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Amazon rainforest and surrounding areas. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and abundant rainfall. It is often associated with moist, well-drained soils in forested habitats.</p>
<p>Acioa edulis plays an important ecological role in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acioa edulis was mainly introduced to new environments to support ecological restoration and biodiversity enhancement.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in reforestation projects due to its ability to thrive in diverse soil conditions. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability make it an effective pioneer species in degraded landscapes. It has been successfully introduced in several regions where soil stabilization and habitat recovery are needed.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
