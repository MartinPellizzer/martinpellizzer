                <h1>Actaea dahurica</h1>
<p>Actaea dahurica, commonly known as white beadroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white, bead-like flowers. The plant features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its roots are often harvested for medicinal purposes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Actaea dahurica is also known for its toxic properties, containing protoanemonin and other compounds that can be harmful if ingested.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea dahurica has large, palmately compound leaves that are typically 10â€“20 cm in diameter, with a deep green color and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is stout and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The plant produces clusters of white, fluffy flowers in late summer, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a red, berry-like structure that contains numerous small seeds, dispersed by birds and mammals.</p>
<p>Its roots are tuberous and fibrous, helping it to survive in woodland environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea dahurica is primarily native to Amur, China North-Central, China Southeast, Chita, Inner Mongolia, Khabarovsk, Korea, Manchuria, Mongolia, and Primorye.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in temperate regions with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in forested areas and mountainous regions, often growing in shaded or partially shaded environments.
