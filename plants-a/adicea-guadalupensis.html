                <h1>Adicea guadalupensis</h1>
<p>Adicea guadalupensis, commonly known as the Guadalupe morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its twining stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in the spring and summer, producing vibrant blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its seeds are enclosed in a fibrous, capsule-like structure.</p>
<p>Adicea guadalupensis is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea guadalupensis has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a light green, smooth bark that grows upright and branching. Its small, clustered flowers are yellow with four petals, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases small seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea guadalupensis is primarily native to the southern United States, specifically Texas and northeastern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast and in coastal prairies. This species thrives in warm, dry environments and is often associated with dune ecosystems. It is also found in some areas of the Gulf Coast region.</p>
<p>Adicea guadalupensis is an important plant in its native habitat, contributing to local biodiversity and ecological stability.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea guadalupensis was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of the Gulf of Mexico and parts of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is commonly found in dune ecosystems. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats and can spread rapidly in coastal areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions where it has established itself.</p>
