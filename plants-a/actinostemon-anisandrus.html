                <h1>Actinostemon anisandrus</h1>
<p>Actinostemon anisandrus, commonly known as the mountain marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes plants such as cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its stout, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. Its flowers are showy, with five to seven petals and a distinctive central column of stamens.</p>
<p>Actinostemon anisandrus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, mountainous climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinostemon anisandrus has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dark green upper surface and lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and woody with a rough, reddish-brown bark. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with yellow petals and a distinctive central stamen, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon anisandrus is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically found in regions of Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. This plant is commonly associated with the Appalachian region and is often found in rich, well-drained soils. It is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and often found in isolated populations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinostemon anisandrus was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought in during the early 20th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. The plant has since become established in moist, shaded environments along stream banks and forest floors. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in these habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is now classified as an invasive species in several areas.</p>
