                <h1>Adinandra elliptica</h1>
<p>Adinandra elliptica, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows up to 10 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves and produces small, fragrant white flowers. Its hard, dense wood is highly valued for its strength and durability.</p>
<p>Adinandra elliptica plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra elliptica has elliptical leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5â€“10 cm long and have a smooth texture. The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that exudes a mild fragrance.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra elliptica is primarily native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions across the country, including the Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao islands. This plant typically grows in lowland to montane forests, often in humid and shaded environments. It is commonly associated with secondary growth areas and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is widespread but not uniform across all Philippine ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra elliptica was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and adaptability.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun exposure. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some non-native areas, sometimes becoming invasive.</p>
<p>It is important to monitor its spread to prevent ecological disruption in local ecosystems.</p>
