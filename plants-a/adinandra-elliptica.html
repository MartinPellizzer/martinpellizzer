                <h1>Adinandra elliptica</h1>
<p>Adinandra elliptica, commonly known as the African ironwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and dense, glossy green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and woodland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for construction and furniture-making.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra elliptica has leaves that are elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in the soil and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra elliptica is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, specifically found in countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Malay Archipelago, where it thrives in lowland and hill forests. The plant prefers humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil, typically found in primary and secondary tropical rainforests. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and deforestation, Adinandra elliptica is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adinandra elliptica is a tropical plant known for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desirable traits. The plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in warm, humid conditions and reaching maturity within several years.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and encourage new shoots. Common pests include aphids and mealybugs, while diseases like root rot can occur if soil conditions are not optimal.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants can enhance its growth and provide a more vibrant garden setting.</p>
