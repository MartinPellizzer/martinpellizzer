<p>Athyrium khasimontanum, commonly known as the Khasi fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern Himalayas, particularly in India and Nepal.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive frond structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, thriving in cool and humid conditions. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Athyrium khasimontanum plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms.</p>
