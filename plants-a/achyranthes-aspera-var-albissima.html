<p>The stem is erect and branched, with a slightly hairy texture and a reddish-brown color, exhibiting a growth pattern that is upright and often sprawling. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with a pale greenish-white color, and bloom during the summer months; they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes aspera var. albissima is a variant of a widespread plant native to southern and eastern Asia, including countries like India, China, and Nepal.</p>
<p>It is now found in various parts of the world, including tropical and subtropical regions, often as an introduced species. This plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils in environments such as forests, fields, and along roadsides. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from lowland areas up to around 1,500 meters.</p>
