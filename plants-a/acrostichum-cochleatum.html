                <h1>Acrostichum cochleatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum cochleatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green leaves that are often divided into broad, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cochleatum has large, feather-like leaves that are elongated, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and typically measure up to 3 meters in length, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is robust and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows in a dense, clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in spikes, which are typically greenish-white in color and bloom during the summer months, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a three-lobed, fleshy drupe that splits open to release three seeds, which are dispersed by water and animals.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cochleatum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangrove swamps, and other moist, saline environments. This plant thrives in humid climates with high salinity levels, often growing in association with other halophytic species. Its natural range includes countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to tidal zones and can tolerate periodic flooding and salt spray.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cochleatum was mainly introduced to coastal and wetland areas where it thrives in moist, saline conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mangrove swamps and tidal flats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. This plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate saltwater and poor soil quality. Its introduction has helped in rehabilitating degraded coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it can also become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
