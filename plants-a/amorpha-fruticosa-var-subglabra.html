                    <h1>Amorpha fruticosa var. subglabra</h1>
<p>Amorpha fruticosa var. subglabra, commonly known as the silky bastard toeberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, multi-branched stems with a somewhat woody structure, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in clusters, typically in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in the spring. Its seeds are enclosed in small, hairy pods that mature in the fall, dispersing via wind or animals.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland edges.</p>
