                <h1>Actinella lanata</h1>
<p>Actinella lanata, commonly known as the woolly actinella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina, it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat make it a notable species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinella lanata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a woolly or fuzzy texture due to their dense pubescence, and they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a pale green to reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after splitting open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella lanata is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the northern and central regions of the country. This plant typically grows in coastal areas and on rocky shores. It thrives in maritime climates with high humidity and salt spray.</p>
<p>Actinella lanata is an important part of New Zealand's native flora and is often found in coastal vegetation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella lanata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silvery foliage. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in natural ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and can outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local biodiversity.</p>
