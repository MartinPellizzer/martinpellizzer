<p>Achillea erba-rotta subsp.</p>
<p>moschata, commonly known as sweet yarrow, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features a rosette of basal, gray-green, aromatic leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in summer.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its strong, pleasant fragrance, which is attributed to essential oils in its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is closely related to other yarrow species and is valued for its ornamental and historical uses.</p>
