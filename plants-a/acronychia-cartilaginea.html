                <h1>Acronychia cartilaginea</h1>
<p>Acronychia cartilaginea, commonly known as the sandpaper fig, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, sandpaper-like bark, which gives it its common name. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, fig-like fruits.</p>
<p>This plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia cartilaginea has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and slightly serrated edges.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale grey bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in inflorescences, and bloom during the wet season, relying on insect pollination for fertilization. The fruit is a small, round drupe that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light, hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia cartilaginea is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. It is commonly associated with the understorey vegetation of these forests. Acronychia cartilaginea is often found in areas with well-drained soil and high rainfall.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the eastern and western parts of New Guinea.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia cartilaginea was mainly introduced to coastal and lowland areas of eastern Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the regions of New South Wales and Queensland. This species is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides and cleared land. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones that provide suitable conditions for its growth.</p>
<p>Despite its limited range, it plays a role in local ecosystems and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
