                <h1>Adenostylis wenzelii</h1>
<p>Adenostylis wenzelii, commonly known as the Wenzel's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flower heads surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, thriving in harsh coastal conditions. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into cylindrical, woody fruits.</p>
<p>Adenostylis wenzelii is often found in association with other coastal flora, contributing to the unique biodiversity of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostylis wenzelii has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a pale green to bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark, and grows upright with a clumping growth pattern. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in spike-like inflorescences, bloom during the spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to the light, feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry, coastal environments where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostylis wenzelii is primarily native to the western coast of the United States, specifically California.</p>
<p>It is found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline. It is commonly observed in areas with mild, Mediterranean-type climates.</p>
<p>Adenostylis wenzelii is an important component of the native flora in California's coastal regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostylis wenzelii was mainly introduced to coastal dunes and sandy soils in the western United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in California and Oregon, where it thrives in well-drained, sunny environments. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize sand dunes. Its introduction has been both intentional and accidental, with some populations resulting from seed dispersal by wind or animals.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and plays a beneficial role in its native habitat.</p>
