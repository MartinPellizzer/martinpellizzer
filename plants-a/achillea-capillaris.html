<p>Achillea capillaris, commonly known as slender yarrow, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and western Asia and is characterized by its slender stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. It has feathery, aromatic leaves and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological and horticultural purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea capillaris has narrow, linear leaves that are grass-like in appearance, arranged in a basal rosette, and range from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a bluish-gray color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a single stem per plant. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called cymes, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, allowing for wind dispersal of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and colonize new areas.</p>
