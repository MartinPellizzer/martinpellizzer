                    <h1>Agrostophyllum mucronatum</h1>
<p>Agrostophyllum mucronatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered together. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy, orange-red berries.</p>
<p>Agrostophyllum mucronatum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects while also affecting the growth of its host trees.</p>
