                <h1>Adiantum platyphyllum</h1>
<p>Adiantum platyphyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces.</p>
<p>Adiantum platyphyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum platyphyllum has delicate, fern-like leaves that are fan-shaped, with a bright green color and a finely serrated margin.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged in a bipinnate pattern, with each leaflet being small and narrow, typically measuring up to 2-3 centimeters in length. The plant has a slender, upright stem that is smooth and slightly hairy, with a light green to yellowish hue. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-yellow in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a spore-bearing sorus, and the plant relies on wind for spore dispersal, with no true seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum platyphyllum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest environments, often growing on rock faces or in crevices. This fern thrives in humid climates with high levels of rainfall. It is particularly associated with mountainous regions where the microclimate supports its growth.</p>
<p>Adiantum platyphyllum is a popular ornamental plant due to its delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum platyphyllum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. This fern is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like foliage. It has been reported as an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid spread.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to prevent its overgrowth in native ecosystems.</p>
