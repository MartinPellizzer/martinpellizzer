<p>Andropogon nutans var. agrostoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in full sun and is often found in prairies, open woodlands, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its growth habit makes it a valuable component of native plant communities and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects.</p>
