                <h1>Adiantum tremulum</h1>
<p>Adiantum tremulum, commonly known as the trembling fern, is a delicate and graceful fern species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that shimmer with a silvery sheen on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with each pinna further divided into smaller segments called pinul√¶.</p>
<p>Adiantum tremulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum tremulum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically light green, with a smooth texture and a slender, upright growth pattern. The plant has a slender, wiry stem that is usually light green and covered with a thin, smooth bark. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a spore-bearing capsule, and the plant disperses its spores through wind, rather than producing seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum tremulum is primarily native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands, stream banks, and rocky crevices. This fern thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, often growing in clusters on the forest floor or on rocky surfaces. Its native range extends from western Europe through much of Asia to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is also present in some parts of Africa and the Middle East, though these populations may be less common.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum tremulum was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly during the 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. This fern is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its delicate, fern-like fronds. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various regions, sometimes becoming invasive in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Adiantum tremulum is now considered an introduced species in many parts of the United States.</p>
