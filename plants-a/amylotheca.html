                    <h1>Amylotheca</h1>
<p>Amylotheca, commonly known as the "liverworts" or more specifically as a genus within the family Porellaceae, is a type of non-vascular plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, thalloid structure and the presence of rhizoids for anchoring and nutrient absorption. Amylotheca species typically thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil surfaces. The plant lacks true stems and leaves, instead having a leaf-like structure called a thallus.</p>
<p>Reproduction occurs through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
