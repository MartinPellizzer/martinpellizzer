                        <h1>Acacia cretata</h1>
<p>Acacia cretata, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Acacia cretata is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
