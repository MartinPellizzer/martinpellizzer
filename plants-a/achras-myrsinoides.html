                <h1>Achras myrsinoides</h1>
<p>Achras myrsinoides, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood and striking red coloration. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in complex inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and valuable timber, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras myrsinoides has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth surface and margins that are often toothed or lobed.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a pale green to reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, blooming during the dry season, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a fleshy, red drupe that contains a single seed, dispersed primarily by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras myrsinoides is primarily native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in dense rainforests and along riverbanks. It is adapted to the warm and wet climate of the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat includes secondary growth and disturbed forest sites.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras myrsinoides was mainly introduced to the Caribbean and parts of Central America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It has since naturalized in several regions, often growing in disturbed areas and along roadsides. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to drought conditions. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
