                    <h1>Alaida</h1>
<p>Alaida, commonly known as the "ghost flower," is a unique plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the genus Alaja in the family Apocynaceae, characterized by its striking, bioluminescent flowers that emit a faint glow at night. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through specialized root systems and water-storing tissues. Its flowers bloom only during specific lunar phases, adding to its mystique.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Alaida is considered a conservation concern in its native habitat.</p>
