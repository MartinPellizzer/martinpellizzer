                    <h1>Aa hartwegii</h1>
<p>Aa hartwegii, commonly known as the Haleakalā silversword, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the volcanic slopes of Haleakalā on the island of Maui in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces a single, tall stem that bears a dense cluster of yellow flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Aa hartwegii is critically endangered and is protected by conservation efforts to prevent its extinction.</p>
