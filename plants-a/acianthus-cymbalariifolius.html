                <h1>Acianthus cymbalariifolius</h1>
<p>Acianthus cymbalariifolius, commonly known as the Cape mountain heath, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are arranged in a dense, mat-like structure. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>Acianthus cymbalariifolius thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthus cymbalariifolius has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size, typically up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and exhibits a light green to reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, featuring white petals with a pale pink base, blooming in spring, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthus cymbalariifolius is primarily native to the Cape Verde Islands.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of these islands. It thrives in rocky and coastal habitats, often growing on limestone substrates. The species is adapted to the warm, dry climate with limited rainfall.</p>
<p>Its distribution is restricted to a few specific locations within the Cape Verde archipelago.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthus cymbalariifolius was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it difficult to control.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists in New Zealand.</p>
