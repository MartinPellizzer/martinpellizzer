                <h1>Acroclinium rubellum</h1>
<p>Acroclinium rubellum, commonly known as the redflower false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its vibrant red petals and yellow center. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branching.</p>
<p>Acroclinium rubellum is known for its showy blooms that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acroclinium rubellum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody as the plant matures, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are tubular with five lobes, displaying vibrant red and orange hues, and bloom from late spring to early summer; they are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds due to their nectar-rich structure and bright colors. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroclinium rubellum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and parts of Alabama.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This species thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often associated with disturbed or swampy habitats. It is also known to occur in the Caribbean, particularly in the Bahamas and Cuba.</p>
<p>Acroclinium rubellum is an important plant in its native range, contributing to local biodiversity and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroclinium rubellum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It was originally native to Central and South America but has since been spread to other regions through human activity. This plant thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and disturbed areas. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various wetland environments across the southeastern U.S.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species and is not typically invasive in the regions where it has been introduced.</p>
