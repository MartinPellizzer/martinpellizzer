                        <h1>Abies lasiocarpa var. conica</h1>
<p>Abies lasiocarpa var. conica, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its conical shape, which is more pronounced in the varietal form conica compared to the typical species. The tree has needle-like leaves that are blue-green in color and are arranged in spirals along the branches. Its cones are cylindrical and contain small, winged seeds.</p>
<p>The bark is thick, furrowed, and often exhibits a reddish-brown color.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies lasiocarpa var. conica is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in the mountainous regions of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in subalpine and alpine environments, growing at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 9,000 feet. This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often found in areas with well-drained soils. It is also present in parts of Canada, including the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia.</p>
<p>The plant is typically found in dense stands, often forming part of the forest canopy in high-elevation ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies lasiocarpa var. conica was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically in higher elevations or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate temperatures and sufficient sunlight, making it suitable for northern latitudes. This variety is often planted in landscapes for its ornamental value, including its conical shape and aromatic foliage. It has been introduced to parts of North America, particularly in the western United States and Canada.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems if it spreads beyond cultivated areas.</p>
