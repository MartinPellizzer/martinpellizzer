                    <h1>Agrostis surculifera</h1>
<p>Agrostis surculifera, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in meadows, along streambanks, and in other wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a common indicator species for wet or semi-wet environments.</p>
