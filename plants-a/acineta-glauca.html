                <h1>Acineta glauca</h1>
<p>Acineta glauca, commonly known as the blue acineta, is a small, flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically silver or gray-green, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acineta glauca is often cultivated in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acineta glauca has small, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and compact, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acineta glauca is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal regions of the Eastern and Western Cape provinces. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with fynbos vegetation. It is also present in parts of Namibia and into southwestern Angola.</p>
<p>Acineta glauca is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, with periods of drought and seasonal rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acineta glauca was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread across various regions of the country. The plant thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often colonizing disturbed soils and open habitats. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through accidental transport via human activities.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and competitive nature, it has become an invasive species in some parts of New Zealand.</p>
