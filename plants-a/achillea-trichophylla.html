                <h1>Achillea trichophylla</h1>
<p>Achillea trichophylla, commonly known as the soft yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It is known for its aromatic leaves and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
<p>The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea trichophylla has basal, lance-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color, arranged in a rosette, and have a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a smooth, light green bark, and grows from the base of the plant. The flowers are yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called umbels, and bloom in late spring to early summer; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread horizontally near the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea trichophylla is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and limestone soils, often growing in sunny, well-drained habitats. This plant is especially prevalent in countries such as Spain, Italy, and Greece. It thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with coastal and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea trichophylla was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gravelly and rocky soils along roadsides and in open fields. This plant is valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is often used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>However, its spread can sometimes lead to competition with native plant species.</p>
