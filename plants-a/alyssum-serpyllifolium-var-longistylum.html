<p>It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with slender, branching stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread readily. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover.</p>
