                <h1>Acer palmatum f. latilobum</h1>
<p>Acer palmatum f. latilobum, commonly known as the Japanese maple with broad lobes, is a cultivar of the Japanese maple tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that are broader and more lobed than those of the typical Acer palmatum. The leaves are typically bright green in summer and turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow in autumn. This ornamental plant thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>It is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in bonsai and as a decorative tree in urban settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum f. latilobum has palmate leaves that are deeply divided into five to seven lobes, with a bright green color during the growing season and a striking red or orange hue in autumn.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement, with a size ranging from 5 to 12 centimeters in diameter. The stem is slender and upright, with smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, with two winged seeds, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to well-drained soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum f. latilobum is a rare variant of the Japanese maple, native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Japan.</p>
<p>While it was originally found in specific areas of Honshu, its current distribution is limited and largely restricted to cultivation due to habitat loss and over-collection. It thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade, typically found in forests or rocky slopes. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 800 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and threats to its survival, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival in the wild.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer palmatum f. latilobum is a beautiful ornamental maple known for its delicate, finely lobed leaves and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant has a slow growth cycle, often reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in partial shade to full sun depending on the climate.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, acidic soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while pruning is minimal, mainly to shape the plant and remove any damaged branches. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be susceptible to aphids or scale insects in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with hostas or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a shaded garden setting.</p>
