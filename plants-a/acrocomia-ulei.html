                <h1>Acrocomia ulei</h1>
<p>Acrocomia ulei, commonly known as the African oil palm, is a tall, slender palm native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features a single, unbranched trunk covered with a fibrous sheath that sheds as the plant matures. The plant produces large, compound leaves that can reach several meters in length, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, with male and female flowers typically found on separate plants.</p>
<p>The fruit, which resembles a coconut, contains a fleshy outer layer and a hard inner shell enclosing the oil-rich seeds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocomia ulei has palm-like leaves that are large, feather-shaped, and arranged in a rosette pattern, with a dark green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and straight, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows in a single trunk. The flowers are clustered in large inflorescences, with yellowish-white petals, and bloom during the dry season; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-valved capsule that disperses seeds by wind after splitting open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out underground, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocomia ulei is primarily native to the Caribbean, particularly the islands of the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and dry forests. It is commonly associated with disturbed habitats and is sometimes used for its edible fruits.</p>
<p>The species is also known for its hardy nature, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocomia ulei was mainly introduced to the Caribbean islands, particularly in the Lesser Antilles, as a potential source of edible nuts and for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It was likely brought by human activity, possibly during colonial times, for agricultural or horticultural purposes. The plant has since become naturalized in some areas, thriving in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. However, its spread has been limited due to its specific habitat requirements and the fragmented nature of its introduction.</p>
<p>Despite its introduction, Acrocomia ulei remains relatively rare and is not widely cultivated outside its native range.</p>
