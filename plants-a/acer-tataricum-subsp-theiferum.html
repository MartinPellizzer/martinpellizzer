                <h1>Acer tataricum subsp. theiferum</h1>
<p>Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>theiferum, commonly known as the Siberian maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and distinctive palmate leaves with five to seven lobes.</p>
<p>The leaves turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall, making it a popular ornamental plant. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit.</p>
<p>This species is relatively hardy and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for a variety of garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>theiferum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The stem is smooth and slender, with a light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a spreading habit.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and arranged in catkins, with a yellowish-green color, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's shrub-like growth form.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>theiferum is a rare variant of the Tatarian maple, native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in parts of Russia and Kazakhstan. While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other areas, including parts of Europe and North America, where it is occasionally cultivated.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in temperate climates, often growing in forested areas or along riverbanks. It is typically found at altitudes between 800 and 2,000 meters, where it prefers well-drained soils and partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited population size, it is considered a species of conservation concern, with efforts underway to protect and propagate it in its native regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>theiferum is a deciduous shrub known for its ornamental value and hardy nature. It can be propagated through softwood cuttings taken in late spring or hardwood cuttings in late autumn.</p>
<p>The growth cycle of this plant involves a period of active growth in spring, followed by dormancy during winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer promotes healthy growth, while pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourages new growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be susceptible to aphids and leaf spot, and it pairs well with companion plants like lavender and yarrow.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>theiferum is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in mixed landscapes, enhancing the growth of neighboring species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving soil structure and supporting a wide range of insect life.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>theiferum is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use but is occasionally used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Its sap, though not as commonly tapped as in other maple species, can be used to make syrup or other sweeteners.</p>
<p>In industrial applications, its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain, making it suitable for furniture and decorative items. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in certain regions where it is associated with resilience and adaptability.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications are more ecological and ornamental than widespread commercial.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>theiferum has several notable varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that contribute to its horticultural appeal. Popular cultivars include 'Bergmannii' and 'Crimson King,' known for their striking foliage and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>Hybrids with other maple species, such as *Acer x antioquianum*, have been developed to enhance ornamental traits like fall color and hardiness. These cultivars and hybrids are valued in gardens for their aesthetic qualities and adaptability to various climates. Overall, Acer tataricum subsp.</p>
<p>theiferum plays a significant role in landscape design due to its visual impact and ease of cultivation.</p>
