<p>Arabis tiehmii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountains in California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, alpine environment. It is an important component of high-elevation ecosystems and is often found in meadows and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
