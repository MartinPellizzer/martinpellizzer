                    <h1>Albersia livida</h1>
<p>Albersia livida, commonly known as the silverleaf albersia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding a delicate touch to its overall form. Albersia livida thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
