                    <h1>Atriplex cinerea var. palmata</h1>
<p>Atriplex cinerea var. palmata, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to further enhance drought tolerance. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
