                <h1>Adenia cissampeloides</h1>
<p>Adenia cissampeloides, commonly known as the Australian trumpet vine, is a climbing shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has opposite, simple leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate, and it produces fleshy, red or yellow berries that are edible for some animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal regions and rainforests.</p>
<p>Adenia cissampeloides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia cissampeloides has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size, typically 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are large, showy, and zygomorphic, with a deep purple to violet color, blooming in late winter to early spring, and are pollinated by birds, particularly honeyeaters. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense, shallow network near the soil surface, aiding in water absorption and anchoring the plant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia cissampeloides is primarily native to Angola, Benin, Burkina, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, DR Congo, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Gulf of Guinea Is., Ivory Coast, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Sudan-South Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded forest environments. It is commonly associated with lowland and mountainous areas within its native range. The species is well adapted to the humid climate and nutrient-rich soils of these regions.</p>
<p>Adenia cissampeloides plays an important ecological role in the ecosystems where it is found.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia cissampeloides was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the wild in the 1980s, likely through accidental introduction via contaminated planting material or seeds. The plant has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the northern parts of the North Island. Its spread is of concern due to its potential to outcompete native species in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to monitor and control its distribution to prevent ecological impacts.</p>
