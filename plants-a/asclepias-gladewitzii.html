<p>Asclepias gladewitzii, commonly known as the Gladewitz milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that attract various pollinators, including butterflies and bees. Its seeds are enclosed in follicles that split open to release tiny, hairy seeds with a silky appendage, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Asclepias gladewitzii plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and a host plant for their larvae.</p>
