                <h1>Adenostemma decumbens</h1>
<p>Adenostemma decumbens, commonly known as creeping milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often prostrate and hairy.</p>
<p>Adenostemma decumbens is known for its milky sap, which is a characteristic feature of the milkweed genus.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma decumbens has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a size ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is prostrate, with a rough, hairy texture and a reddish-brown color, growing along the ground and branching from the base. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with yellow petals and stamens, blooming from summer to autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma decumbens is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, growing in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with wetland ecosystems. It is also present in parts of Central America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to areas with high rainfall and nutrient-rich soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma decumbens was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, pastures, and degraded lands.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, temperate climates with well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas make it an invasive species in many regions.</p>
<p>It is often considered a weed due to its competitive nature and potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
