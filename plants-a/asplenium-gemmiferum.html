<p>Asplenium gemmiferum, commonly known as the gemmiferous spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fertile leaves, which are typically clustered in small, rounded structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Asplenium gemmiferum is also notable for its ability to propagate through vegetative means, such as the growth of gemmae, which are tiny plantlets that can develop into new individuals.</p>
