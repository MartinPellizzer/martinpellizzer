                    <h1>Asplenium raoulii var. colensoi</h1>
<p>Asplenium raoulii var. colensoi, commonly known as the Colenso's shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed shield fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically broad and shield-shaped, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread through underground growth.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat.</p>
