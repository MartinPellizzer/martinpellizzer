                    <h1>Atriplex macropterocarpa</h1>
<p>Atriplex macropterocarpa, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, which are adapted for pollination by insects. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Atriplex macropterocarpa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
