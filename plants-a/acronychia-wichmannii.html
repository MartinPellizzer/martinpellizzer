                <h1>Acronychia wichmannii</h1>
<p>Acronychia wichmannii, commonly known as the Wimmera acronychia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open forests and woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia wichmannii has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, often pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown or reddish-brown, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with a spreading growth habit. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in umbels, and bloom during the wet season; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense, shallow network, helping to stabilize the plant in sandy or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia wichmannii is primarily native to the northern regions of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the rainforests and coastal areas of this region. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with lowland and hill rainforest habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within northeastern Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia wichmannii was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the northern and eastern parts of the country. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. It has also been introduced to other parts of the world, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by its specific environmental requirements.</p>
