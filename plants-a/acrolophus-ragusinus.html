                <h1>Acrolophus ragusinus</h1>
<p>Acrolophus ragusinus, commonly known as the Ragusan grass moth, is a species of moth belonging to the family Acrolophidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small size and distinctive wing patterns, which often feature intricate geometric designs. The plant association of this species is primarily with grasses, as its larvae feed on various grass species. Its life cycle involves a short flight period during the summer months, and it is found in regions with temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and localized species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrolophus ragusinus has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a climbing or trailing manner. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes, blooming in late spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolophus ragusinus is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly the island of Sicily.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of southern Italy and the surrounding islands. This plant thrives in rocky and coastal areas, often growing on limestone substrates. It is commonly associated with dry, sunny habitats and is well adapted to the climate of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolophus ragusinus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 1970s and has since become established in various regions of the country. The plant is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native flora. It thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
