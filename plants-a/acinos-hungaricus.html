                <h1>Acinos hungaricus</h1>
<p>Acinos hungaricus, commonly known as the Hungarian mountain aster, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers bloom in the summer, producing a showy display of purple to pink hues.</p>
<p>Acinos hungaricus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in cooler climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos hungaricus has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dull green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, white to pale pink, clustered in dense umbels, and bloom in early summer; they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos hungaricus is primarily native to Central and Eastern Europe, including regions such as Hungary, Romania, Serbia, and parts of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, rocky, and grassy habitats, often found on slopes and in mountainous areas. This plant is commonly associated with the Carpathian Mountains and adjacent regions. It is adapted to temperate climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to these specific geographic areas within Europe.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos hungaricus was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and moderate climates, often in mountainous or alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky or gravelly habitats where it can thrive in full sun. This plant has been introduced to several regions beyond its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming a weed in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies in some areas, it is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits.</p>
