                <h1>Achras glaucescens</h1>
<p>Achras glaucescens, commonly known as the African silver tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, deciduous tree or shrub that typically grows up to 5 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its silver-gray, fuzzy leaves and yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to dry climates.</p>
<p>The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras glaucescens has large, palmate leaves that are typically 1 to 2 meters in diameter, with a waxy, bluish-green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant, providing a dense, umbrella-like appearance. The stem is short and stout, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. The plant produces large, yellowish-white flowers with a complex structure, blooming during the rainy season and primarily pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a large, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras glaucescens is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of Cuba, Jamaica, and Hispaniola.</p>
<p>It is also found in Central America, particularly in countries like Mexico and Belize. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and dry forests. It is commonly associated with sandy soils and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends to some parts of South America, such as northern Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras glaucescens was mainly introduced to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites due to its adaptability to various soil types. This plant is often used in ornamental horticulture for its large, waxy leaves and unique appearance. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impact in areas where it has established itself.</p>
