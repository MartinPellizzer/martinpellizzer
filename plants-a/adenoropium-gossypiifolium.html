                <h1>Adenoropium gossypiifolium</h1>
<p>Adenoropium gossypiifolium, commonly known as the cottonleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus species. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. Its leaves are broad and often resemble cotton fibers, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, sunny environments and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenoropium gossypiifolium has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a smooth texture and moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light green to brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoropium gossypiifolium is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical areas of the West Indies. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forests or near water sources. It is particularly associated with the islands of Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific regions, where it plays a role in the local flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoropium gossypiifolium was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as a potential ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant's rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists.</p>
<p>Efforts are now being made to control its distribution and prevent further ecological damage.</p>
