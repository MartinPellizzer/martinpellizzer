                        <h1>Abutilon pannosum var. pannosum</h1>
<p>Abutilon pannosum var. pannosum, commonly known as the woolly abutilon, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive appearance.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Abutilon pannosum var. pannosum belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises vascular plants with a wide range of morphological diversity, including fern allies and some modern seed plants. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is known for its primitive floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malvales, a group of flowering plants that includes plants such as cotton and hibiscus, characterized by their showy flowers and specialized structures. Its family is Malvaceae, commonly known as the mallow family, which includes plants with palmate leaves and capsule fruits. Its genus is Abutilon, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "Chinese lantern," characterized by their fuzzy leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Abutilon pannosum, a specific variety known for its distinctive appearance and adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon pannosum var. pannosum is primarily native to Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, Burkina, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Chad, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gulf States, India, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon-Syria, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sinai, Socotra, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan-South Sudan, and Yemen.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is commonly seen in dry habitats such as deserts, scrublands, and coastal areas. The species is well adapted to hot and dry climates, making it a resilient plant in these regions.</p>
<p>Its native range spans across several continents, including Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon pannosum var. pannosum was mainly introduced to Aldabra, Mauritius, and Rodrigues.</p>
<p>It is believed to have been introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in these regions, often growing in disturbed habitats such as coastal areas and roadsides. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
