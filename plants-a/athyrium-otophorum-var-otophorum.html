                    <h1>Athyrium otophorum var. otophorum</h1>
<p>Athyrium otophorum var. otophorum, commonly known as the Otophorum Athyrium, is a fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, arching fronds with a dark green coloration and a finely textured appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming compact clumps.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the Athyrium genus.</p>
