<p>Atriplex barclayana subsp.</p>
<p>dilatata, commonly known as the broadleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its succulent, lobed leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Its salt tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
