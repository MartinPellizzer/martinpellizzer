<p>Acer sikkimense f. serrulatum, commonly known as the Sikkim maple, is a variant of the Sikkim maple native to the eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive serrated leaf margins, which give it its specific epithet "serrulatum.". The plant typically grows in moist, cool forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Its leaves are usually palmately lobed, with a vibrant green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The species produces small, red or yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras (winged seeds) that aid in its dispersal.</p>
