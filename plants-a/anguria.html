<p>Anguria, commonly known as watermelon, is a sprawling vine native to Africa and widely cultivated for its large, fleshy fruits.</p>

Its flowers are typically yellow with five petals, and the fruit develops from a single ovary, maturing to a red or pink color. The outer rind is thick and fibrous, while the interior contains juicy, seed-filled pulp.</p>
<p>Anguria is rich in water, vitamins, and antioxidants, making it a popular fruit in many cuisines.</p>
