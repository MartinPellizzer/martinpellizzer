<p>Abies kamtschatica, commonly known as the Siberian fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the cold climates of eastern Siberia and northern Mongolia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, round cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to harsh, subarctic conditions.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its timber and is also an important component of boreal forest ecosystems.</p>
