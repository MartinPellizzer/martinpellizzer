                    <h1>Aristida lanosa var. macera</h1>
<p>Aristida lanosa var. macera, commonly known as the hairy threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered in threes, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive silvery-blue hue due to the dense pubescence.</p>
<p>This grass is adapted to drought conditions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
