                    <h1>Agropyron littorale var. nodosum</h1>
<p>Agropyron littorale var. nodosum, commonly known as sea barleygrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it an important pioneer species in coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Its ability to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion makes it ecologically significant in maritime environments.</p>
