                    <h1>Amaranthus lividus var. oleraceus</h1>
<p>Amaranthus lividus var. oleraceus, commonly known as tumbleweed amaranth, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to spread rapidly in arid environments. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal, it is considered a weed in many agricultural areas.</p>
