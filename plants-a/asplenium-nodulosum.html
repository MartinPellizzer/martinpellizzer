                    <h1>Asplenium nodulosum</h1>
<p>Asplenium nodulosum, commonly known as the clustered spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices, walls, and under trees. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, clustered spore-producing structures called sporangia. Its fronds are usually short and do not exceed a few centimeters in length.</p>
<p>Asplenium nodulosum is a non-vascular plant that reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
