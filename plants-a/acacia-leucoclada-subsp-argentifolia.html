<p>Acacia leucoclada subsp.</p>
<p>argentifolia, commonly known as silver-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow floral spikes that appear in spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The acacia's thorned stems and nitrogen-fixing ability contribute to its ecological importance in its native habitat.</p>
