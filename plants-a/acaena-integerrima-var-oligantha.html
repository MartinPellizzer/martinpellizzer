<p>Acaena integerrima var. oligantha, commonly known as the small burr bush, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features dense, spiny foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are clustered in dense, spiky formations called burrs. These burrs are adapted for seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
