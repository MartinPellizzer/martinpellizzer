                        <h1>Acaena integerrima var. oligantha</h1>
<p>Acaena integerrima var. oligantha, commonly known as the small burr bush, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features dense, spiny foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are clustered in dense, spiky formations called burrs. These burrs are adapted for seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena integerrima var. oligantha is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern regions of the country, particularly in the South Island. This variant thrives in coastal and inland areas, often in dry, open habitats. It is commonly associated with grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and is part of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena integerrima var. oligantha was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century as part of the introduction of ornamental and agricultural plants. The plant has since become naturalized and is now found in various regions across the country. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and has not displaced native plant species in significant numbers.</p>
