                <h1>Acer pseudoplatanus f. erythrocarpum</h1>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. erythrocarpum, commonly known as the red-fruited maple, is a cultivar of the common maple tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red or orange-red samaras, which persist on the tree well into winter. The foliage is typically similar to that of the parent species, with palmate leaves that turn vibrant colors in autumn. This ornamental variety is prized for its decorative fruits and is often used in landscaping.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. erythrocarpum has palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and somewhat woody, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, exhibiting a slow, upright growth pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in panicles and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread over a wide area.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant and absorbing water and nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. erythrocarpum is a rare and distinctive variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of southern and western Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and the Alps.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and fragmented, with only a few known populations remaining. This form thrives in cool, moist environments such as mountain forests and shaded woodlands, often growing at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered, with conservation efforts focused on protecting and stabilizing its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. erythrocarpum is a unique variant of the maple tree known for its distinctive red fruits and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings offering more reliable results. The growth cycle involves a period of rapid growth in spring and early summer, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. erythrocarpum is a unique variant of the maple tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved microclimate conditions. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, its presence supports ecological benefits by promoting habitat diversity and contributing to carbon sequestration.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. erythrocarpum is a rare variant of the maple tree known for its distinctive red fruits, which are primarily of ornamental value in horticulture and gardening.</p>
<p>While not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and fruits may be occasionally used in traditional herbal remedies for their potential diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. In industrial contexts, its wood is not widely utilized due to its rarity and limited availability. Culturally, it is appreciated for its aesthetic appeal and is often featured in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
<p>Symbolically, it represents the diversity and uniqueness of plant life, contributing to ecological and botanical research.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pseudoplatanus f. erythrocarpum has a limited number of recognized cultivars, with 'Erythrocarpus' being the most popular for its distinctive red fruits.</p>
<p>It is also frequently used as a parent in hybridization efforts, leading to crosses with other maple species such as Acer caeruleum and Acer negundo. These hybrids often exhibit enhanced ornamental traits, including vibrant autumn foliage and unique fruiting characteristics. Due to its unique features, it holds horticultural importance as a source of genetic diversity in maple breeding programs.</p>
<p>However, its cultivation is relatively rare compared to other maple species.</p>
