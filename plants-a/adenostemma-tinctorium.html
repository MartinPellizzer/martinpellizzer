                <h1>Adenostemma tinctorium</h1>
<p>Adenostemma tinctorium, commonly known as redroot false flax, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its roots are characterized by their reddish color and are used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.</p>
<p>Adenostemma tinctorium is also valued for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its role in ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostemma tinctorium has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 3 to 8 centimeters in length, with a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough texture and a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age, growing upright and branching sparsely. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with five pink to purple petals, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma tinctorium is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grasslands, savannas, and along riverbanks in these areas. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often part of the vegetation in open habitats. It is also present in parts of Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>Adenostemma tinctorium is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in various cultures for its healing benefits.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostemma tinctorium was mainly introduced to control erosion and as a forage crop in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along waterways. The plant has been reported in several countries including Australia, India, and parts of Africa. It spreads through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind, water, and animals.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some environments if not managed properly.</p>
