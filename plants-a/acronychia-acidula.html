                <h1>Acronychia acidula</h1>
<p>Acronychia acidula, commonly known as the native lime or sour lime, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by round, green fruits that turn yellow when ripe. The fruit is edible, though its sour taste makes it popular in traditional Indigenous Australian cuisine.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance and cultural significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia acidula has alternate, simple, elliptic to ovate leaves that are glossy green on top and pale beneath, with a leathery texture and a smooth margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically gray to brown in color. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in spikes, with four petals and stamens, blooming from June to September, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, smooth, green drupe that turns yellow when ripe, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a shallow network, aiding in the plant's anchoring and water absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia acidula is primarily native to Queensland.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the state, particularly in the northeastern and eastern parts. The plant thrives in coastal and lowland rainforests, often growing as an understory species. It is commonly associated with sandy or clay soils in these areas.</p>
<p>Acronychia acidula is well adapted to the warm, humid climate of Queensland's tropical zones.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia acidula was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of Australia, particularly in the northern and eastern parts of the country.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, rainforests, and disturbed soils where it can thrive in a variety of soil types. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate urban conditions. It has also been introduced to other parts of the world, including Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, its spread is generally limited by its preference for humid climates and specific soil conditions.</p>
