<p>Acronychia acidula, commonly known as the native lime or sour lime, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by round, green fruits that turn yellow when ripe. The fruit is edible, though its sour taste makes it popular in traditional Indigenous Australian cuisine.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance and cultural significance.</p>
