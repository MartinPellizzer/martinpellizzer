                <h1>Adiantum pallens</h1>
<p>Adiantum pallens, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically silver-white in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced.</p>
<p>Adiantum pallens is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum pallens has fern-like leaves that are pinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically small, measuring up to 30 cm in length, with a light green color that turns bronze or reddish in the fall. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a climbing or trailing pattern. Adiantum pallens produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds; it does not produce true flowers, seeds, or fruits.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and adventitious, helping it to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum pallens is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in moist, shaded environments like forests and stream banks. This fern thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, often growing on rocky substrates or in crevices. Its distribution extends to parts of Malaysia and the Indian subcontinent as well.</p>
<p>Adiantum pallens is an epiphytic plant, meaning it often grows on trees or other structures rather than in soil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum pallens was mainly introduced to North America, particularly the eastern United States, as an ornamental plant due to its delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has been established in the wild in several states, including Pennsylvania, New York, and Virginia. It is considered invasive in some regions because of its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to manage its distribution and prevent further spread into new habitats.</p>
