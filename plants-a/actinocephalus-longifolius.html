                <h1>Actinocephalus longifolius</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved actinocephalus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is known for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus longifolius has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate-shaped leaflets that are dark green in color and measure approximately 2-5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in a smooth, reddish-brown bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, aiding in nutrient absorption and soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus longifolius is primarily native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Western Cape Province, where it grows in coastal and mountainous regions. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. It is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, with dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Actinocephalus longifolius is also present in parts of Namibia and possibly Mozambique.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus longifolius was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as part of the broader introduction of exotic plant species. The plant thrives in coastal and maritime environments, often growing on dunes and rocky shores. It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly along the west coast.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited compared to other invasive species in the area.</p>
