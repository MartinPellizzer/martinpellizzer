<p>Asplenium × helii nothosubsp.</p>
<p>lainzii, commonly known as the Lainz hybrid shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between *Asplenium trichomanes* and *Asplenium bulbiferum*. It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage and dark green, leathery fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its unique morphology and ornamental appeal have made it a subject of interest in botanical research.</p>
<p>This nothosubspecies exemplifies the genetic diversity and adaptability found in hybrid plant species.</p>
