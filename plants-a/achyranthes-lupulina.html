                <h1>Achyranthes lupulina</h1>
<p>Achyranthes lupulina, commonly known as the bitter nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the summer months. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Achyranthes lupulina is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and wastelands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes lupulina has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 3–8 cm long and 1–3 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stems are cylindrical, slightly hairy, and have a reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age, growing in a prostrate or ascending manner. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with greenish-white petals and stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind, with each seed having a short, wing-like structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in water absorption and soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes lupulina is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky or dry soils and is commonly found in areas with a temperate climate. This plant is often associated with coastal and mountainous habitats due to its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions. It is also present in some regions of the Canary Islands and has been introduced to other parts of the world as an ornamental or medicinal plant.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to areas with low precipitation and well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes lupulina was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as agriculture and horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it can thrive in a variety of soil types. This plant has spread to several regions outside its native range, including parts of North America. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, its impact varies depending on local environmental conditions and management practices.</p>
