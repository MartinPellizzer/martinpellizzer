                <h1>Adenopus diversifolius</h1>
<p>Adenopus diversifolius, commonly known as the African silver bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a woody stem with distinctive, branched thorns, which provide some protection from herbivores. Its leaves are alternate and vary in shape, contributing to its common name "diversifolius," meaning "varied leaves.".</p>
<p>Adenopus diversifolius is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenopus diversifolius has leaves that are typically lanceolate or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length, and a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white or pale yellow petals, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopus diversifolius is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open woodlands, savannas, and along riverbanks. It is well adapted to the warm and humid climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Adenopus diversifolius is an important component of the local flora and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenopus diversifolius was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas where it thrives in sandy soils and full sun exposure. The plant has been reported in countries such as Hawaii, Guam, and the Mariana Islands. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
