                    <h1>Adiantum calcareum</h1>
<p>Adiantum calcareum, commonly known as the limestone maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in calcareous soils and shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or woodland areas. The plant features finely divided, bright green fronds with a distinctive, graceful appearance. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Adiantum calcareum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions.</p>
