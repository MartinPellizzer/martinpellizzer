                <h1>Adiantum calcareum</h1>
<p>Adiantum calcareum, commonly known as the limestone maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in calcareous soils and shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or woodland areas. The plant features finely divided, bright green fronds with a distinctive, graceful appearance. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Adiantum calcareum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum calcareum has fern-like leaves that are bipinnate, with a delicate, lacey appearance, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically small, ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters in length, and have a dark green color with a slightly silvery underside. The stem is slender, upright, and covered with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a branching pattern. Adiantum calcareum produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, appearing in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant forms spore-bearing structures rather than flowers and fruits, with spores dispersed by wind, and its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the rocky substrate.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum calcareum is primarily native to Brazil Northeast and Brazil West-Central.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in rocky and calcareous soils in these regions. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with high rainfall. The plant is often seen growing in shaded, rocky outcrops and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum calcareum was mainly introduced to areas with calcareous soils and rocky outcrops, often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in North America, particularly in the eastern United States. This plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often associated with forested areas. Its distribution has been expanded through human activity, including horticultural trade and accidental introduction.</p>
<p>It is now considered an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
