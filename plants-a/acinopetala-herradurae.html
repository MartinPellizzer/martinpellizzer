                <h1>Acinopetala herradurae</h1>
<p>Acinopetala herradurae, commonly known as the Mexican flame flower, is a striking member of the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its vibrant red and orange tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant features opposite, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a sought-after plant among horticulturists and botanists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinopetala herradurae has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinopetala herradurae is primarily native to the Sierra Madre de Oaxaca in southern Mexico.</p>
<p>This rare plant is found in the high-altitude cloud forests of this region. It thrives in moist, shaded environments with well-drained soil. The species is known for its unique floral structure and is considered endemic to this specific area.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is also listed as critically endangered.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinopetala herradurae was mainly introduced to areas with high biodiversity and ecological significance, such as cloud forests and humid temperate regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist climate to flourish. The plant is often found in shaded undergrowth, where it can receive indirect sunlight. Due to its unique characteristics, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native flora in non-native habitats.</p>
