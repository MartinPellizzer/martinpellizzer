                    <h1>Aesculus × versicolor</h1>
<p>Aesculus × versicolor, commonly known as the horse chestnut tree, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately compound leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, and its showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The tree produces spiny, capsule-like fruits that contain shiny, chestnut-like seeds. Its botanical name reflects its hybrid origin, derived from Aesculus glabra and Aesculus hippocastanum.</p>
<p>The horse chestnut is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often planted in urban landscapes for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
