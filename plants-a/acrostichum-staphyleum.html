                <h1>Acrostichum staphyleum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum staphyleum, commonly known as the golden fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a subtle golden hue. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures include spore-producing cones, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum staphyleum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum staphyleum has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind once it splits open.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum staphyleum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, riverbanks, and wetlands where it thrives in humid and saline conditions. This plant is often associated with mangrove ecosystems and can be found growing in brackish water environments. Its distribution is also observed in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum staphyleum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often near water bodies such as streams and ponds.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures, making it common in tropical and subtropical regions. This plant is typically found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of forests where it can receive adequate moisture. Its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native species in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been spread to various parts of the world where similar environmental conditions exist.</p>
