<p>Arenaria acutisepala, commonly known as the sharp-sepaled sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of succulent, fleshy leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers with five distinct sepals, which are sharply pointed, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Arenaria acutisepala plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
