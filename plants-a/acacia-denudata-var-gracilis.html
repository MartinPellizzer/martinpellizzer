                        <h1>Acacia denudata var. gracilis</h1>
<p>Acacia denudata var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that appear in late summer, attracting a variety of pollinators. It is adapted to low rainfall and can thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its growth form and ecological role make it an important component of arid ecosystems.</p>
