                    <h1>Atriplex verreauxii</h1>
<p>Atriplex verreauxii, commonly known as the Namib Desert saltbush, is a hardy shrub native to the hyperarid regions of Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting to extreme aridity. The plant produces small greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Chenopodiaceae family. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its deep root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its harsh environment.</p>
