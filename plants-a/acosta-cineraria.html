                <h1>Acosta cineraria</h1>
<p>Acosta cineraria, commonly known as the cineraria, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are often hairy and grayish-green, while its stems are erect and sturdy.</p>
<p>Acosta cineraria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta cineraria has leaves that are narrow, linear, and slightly hairy, arranged alternately along the stem, with a silvery-gray color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, covered in a rough, grayish-brown bark, and exhibits a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale blue petals, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when dry, and the seeds are tiny and dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the arid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta cineraria is primarily native to the Andean region of South America, particularly in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically found in the mountainous areas of the Andes. This plant is commonly found in rocky soils and open slopes at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. It is well adapted to the cool and often arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is not commonly found outside of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta cineraria was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates where it can thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to establish quickly. Its distribution has been expanded through human activity, including landscaping and restoration projects.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
