<p>Abutilon umbellatum subsp.</p>
<p>occidentalis, commonly known as the western Abutilon, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its fibrous bark and hairy stems are characteristic of the Abutilon genus.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to dry climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon umbellatum subsp.</p>
<p>occidentalis has ovate to elliptic leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a smooth texture and a dark green upper surface contrasting with a lighter underside. The stem is slender, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are pendulous, with five pink or reddish-purple petals and a yellow center, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a 3-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the soil.</p>
