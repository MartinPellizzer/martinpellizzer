                <h1>Achyroseris tragopogonoides</h1>
<p>Achyroseris tragopogonoides, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers and woolly, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and growth habits reflect its evolutionary adaptations to survive in harsh, dry climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyroseris tragopogonoides has basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are usually hairy, green, and arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and somewhat woody, with a pale green color, and it grows from the base of the plant. The flowers are yellow, with a radiate structure consisting of ray florets and disk florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in its rocky or sandy habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyroseris tragopogonoides is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. This plant thrives in environments such as desert grasslands, rocky slopes, and along dry streambeds. Its distribution includes states like Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, as well as parts of Sonora and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyroseris tragopogonoides was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as a potential ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native plants in various ecosystems. The distribution of this plant is now widespread across the North Island, particularly in disturbed areas like roadsides and forest edges.</p>
<p>Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
