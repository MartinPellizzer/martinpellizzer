<p>Allantodia maxima, commonly known as the giant allantodia, is a striking member of the Acanthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. Its flowers, which are typically violet or purple, are clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticulture.</p>
