<p>Agave × taylorea, commonly known as the Texas aloe, is a hybrid succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its rosette growth habit and ability to store water in its leaves make it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
