                <h1>Acalyphopsis celebica</h1>
<p>Acalyphopsis celebica, commonly known as the Celebes acalyphopsis, is a flowering plant native to Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are usually simple and alternate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalyphopsis celebica has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 2â€“4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, growing in a straight, upright pattern. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalyphopsis celebica is a rare flowering plant native to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to specific regions within the western part of the island, particularly in the northern and central highlands. It thrives in humid, tropical rainforest environments, often growing in shaded understorey conditions. The species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 600 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalyphopsis celebica is a tropical plant known for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most effective method for faster growth. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 1-2 years under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer every few months and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or mealybugs, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like basil or marigold can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>
