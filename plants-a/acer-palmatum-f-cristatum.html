                    <h1>Acer palmatum f. cristatum</h1>
<p>Acer palmatum f. cristatum, commonly known as the crested maple, is a unique cultivar of the Japanese maple characterized by its distinctive, upward-curled leaves that form a crown-like shape.</p>
<p>This variation arises from a natural mutation known as "cristation," which results in a fan-like growth pattern. The plant typically exhibits vibrant foliage, ranging from green to red or orange, depending on the season and environmental conditions. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its unusual appearance, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in horticulture.</p>
