                <h1>Acinodendron bracteolatum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron bracteolatum, commonly known as the African milkwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in savannas and rocky areas.</p>
<p>The tree has historical uses in traditional medicine and is also valued for its timber and as a source of shade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron bracteolatum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth texture, dark green on top, and lighter green underneath, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a slightly fibrous texture, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture efficiently from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron bracteolatum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Its distribution includes parts of the Philippines and possibly the Andaman Islands.</p>
<p>It is often associated with disturbed habitats and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron bracteolatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions such as Hawaii and the Mariana Islands.</p>
<p>It was brought there intentionally for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it well-suited for these introduced locations. However, it has also been reported to spread beyond cultivated areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, its invasive tendencies have led to increased monitoring and management efforts in some regions.</p>
