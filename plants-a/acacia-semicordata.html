<p>Acacia semicordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, sickle-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which attract a variety of pollinators such as bees and birds. Acacia semicordata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy species suited to dry climates.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
