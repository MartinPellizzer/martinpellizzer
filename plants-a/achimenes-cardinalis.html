<p>Achimenes cardinalis, commonly known as the cardinal balsam, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are borne on long, slender stems and are often used in ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>Achimenes cardinalis thrives in warm, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes cardinalis has heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age.
