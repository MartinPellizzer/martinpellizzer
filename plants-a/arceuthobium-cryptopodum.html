                    <h1>Arceuthobium cryptopodum</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium cryptopodum, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host, typically members of the Ericaceae family, for nutrients and water. The plant is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and its unique method of seed dispersal, where the seeds are launched into the air upon disturbance. It is found in moist, acidic soils across the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a minor role in ecological systems but is of interest to botanists studying parasitic relationships.</p>
