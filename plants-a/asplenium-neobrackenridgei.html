                    <h1>Asplenium neobrackenridgei</h1>
<p>Asplenium neobrackenridgei, commonly known as the New Zealand rock fern, is a rare and endemic species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Asplenium neobrackenridgei is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
