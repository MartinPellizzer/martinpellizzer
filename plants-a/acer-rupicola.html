                <h1>Acer rupicola</h1>
<p>Acer rupicola, commonly known as the rock maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree typically grows on rocky slopes and cliffs, adapting to harsh, well-drained soils. Its small, bright red fruits are an important food source for birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acer rupicola is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer rupicola has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5 to 10 cm in length; they are usually bright green in summer and turn vibrant yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, vertical strips as the tree matures. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, clustered in upright catkins, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and winged structure.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, helping it anchor in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer rupicola is a rare and elusive maple species native to the mountainous regions of central China, specifically in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While its native range is well-documented, its current distribution is limited and poorly understood due to its elusive nature and difficulty in identification. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soils, typically found in rocky or forested mountain slopes. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, Acer rupicola is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer rupicola is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant fall foliage and unique rock-like growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of Acer rupicola includes a dormant phase in winter, active growth in spring, and a period of slow development in summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture levels, requiring regular watering during dry spells but avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to shape the tree and remove dead or diseased branches.</p>
<p>Common pests include aphids and scale insects, while diseases like leaf spot can occur in humid conditions, making companion planting with moisture-loving plants like ferns and hostas beneficial for ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer rupicola is a hardy shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in rocky or alpine environments, enhancing biodiversity in harsh conditions. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and preventing landslides.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by improving soil structure and supporting microbial activity.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer rupicola is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential nutritional benefits. In traditional medicine, it has been used to treat various ailments, though scientific validation is limited. Economically, it contributes to local biodiversity and supports wildlife, making it valuable in conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some indigenous communities, representing resilience and adaptability in harsh environments.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer rupicola has several popular cultivars such as 'Crimson King' and 'Orange Glow', which are prized for their vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>It also has hybrids with other maple species, contributing to the diversity of ornamental maples in horticulture. These varieties are often used in landscaping for their aesthetic value and adaptability to various climates. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in rocky soils and its striking color changes during the fall season.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer rupicola plays a significant role in enhancing garden beauty and biodiversity.</p>
