                        <h1>Acer rupicola</h1>
<p>Acer rupicola, commonly known as the rock maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree typically grows on rocky slopes and cliffs, adapting to harsh, well-drained soils. Its small, bright red fruits are an important food source for birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acer rupicola is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
