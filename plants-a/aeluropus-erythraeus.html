                <h1>Aeluropus erythraeus</h1>
<p>Aeluropus erythraeus, commonly known as the red sandflat grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in salt marshes and sandy shores. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Aeluropus erythraeus plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeluropus erythraeus has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically flat, linear, and slightly rolled at the edges, arranged in a dense rosette pattern, with a bluish-gray color due to a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, pale green surface, growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a three-lobed, dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind when it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in sandy or saline soils.</p>
