                <h1>Acritopappus diamantinicus</h1>
<p>Acritopappus diamantinicus, commonly known as the Diamond Mountain daisy, is a flowering plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disc florets. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens in suitable climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acritopappus diamantinicus has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with narrow, lanceolate leaflets that are dark green in color and measure approximately 2-4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows in a sprawling or ascending pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with tubular corollas, blooming from late spring to early summer, and is primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acritopappus diamantinicus is primarily native to Brazil Northeast.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the northeastern region of Brazil, where it thrives in specific ecological conditions. It is commonly associated with rocky and semi-arid environments in this area. The species is adapted to the unique climate and soil characteristics of the region.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely confined to this part of Brazil due to its specific habitat requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acritopappus diamantinicus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and disturbed forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high levels of sunlight and well-drained soils. The plant is particularly adapted to environments with low nutrient availability. Its introduction has been observed in several regions of South America, including Brazil and Argentina.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
