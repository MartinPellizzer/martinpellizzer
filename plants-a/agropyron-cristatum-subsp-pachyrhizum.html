<p>Agropyron cristatum subsp.</p>
<p>pachyrhizum, commonly known as the tufted wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces spikelets that are often arranged in a loose panicle, with leathery, bluish-green leaves that are typically narrow and grass-like. It is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its drought tolerance and is used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
