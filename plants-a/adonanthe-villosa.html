                <h1>Adonanthe villosa</h1>
<p>Adonanthe villosa, commonly known as the hairy adonanthe, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Adonanthe villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonanthe villosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dull green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and has a light green to brownish color, with a climbing growth pattern that often involves twining around supports. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, with five petals and a tubular structure, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonanthe villosa is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically from New Jersey southward to Florida and westward to Texas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, open habitats such as woodlands, thickets, and along streambanks. This species thrives in partial to full shade and is often seen growing in the understory of forests. It is also found in some parts of Mexico, particularly in the southeastern regions.</p>
<p>Adonanthe villosa is a member of the Apiaceae family and is known for its distinctive, hairy foliage and small white flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonanthe villosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the late 19th century and has since become naturalized in several regions of the country. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing in forests and along stream banks. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
