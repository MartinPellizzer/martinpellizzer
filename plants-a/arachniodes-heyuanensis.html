                    <h1>Arachniodes heyuanensis</h1>
<p>Arachniodes heyuanensis, commonly known as the Heyuan fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves with a distinctive frond structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
