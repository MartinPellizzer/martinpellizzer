                <h1>Acer yangjuechi</h1>
<p>Acer yangjuechi, commonly known as the Yangjuechi maple, is a species native to China.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree characterized by its vibrant autumn foliage, which displays shades of red and orange. The leaves are typically palmately lobed with serrated edges. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer yangjuechi has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a deciduous tree with a spreading crown. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's native habitat in rocky or mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer yangjuechi is a rare species of maple native to China, specifically found in the Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the mountainous regions of this area. It thrives in humid, temperate environments with well-drained soil, typically growing in mixed forests. The plant is usually found at altitudes between 2,000 and 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Acer yangjuechi is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer yangjuechi is a rare maple species native to China, known for its ornamental value and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification to break dormancy. The growth cycle involves a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil with consistent moisture, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and regular pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is relatively pest and disease resistant, though aphids and scale insects may occasionally infest it, and it pairs well with other shade-loving plants like ferns and hostas in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer yangjuechi is a lesser-known species of maple that plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. The plant attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its flowers, supporting local biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil health and promoting the growth of other native species.</p>
<p>Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for stabilizing land in mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer yangjuechi is a rare tree species native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>It is primarily used in horticulture and landscape design due to its striking autumn foliage, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens and urban green spaces. While it is not widely used in culinary or medicinal applications, it plays a role in traditional Chinese medicine in some regions. The tree also contributes to local biodiversity and soil stabilization, supporting industrial and economic activities related to forestry and conservation.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and natural beauty, often featured in local art and environmental initiatives.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer yangjuechi has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are of interest to horticulturists and plant enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Among the popular cultivars are 'Jingyue' and 'Fenghuang,' which are prized for their vibrant autumn foliage and compact growth habits. Hybrids of Acer yangjuechi have been developed to enhance traits such as cold hardiness, disease resistance, and ornamental value. These cultivars and hybrids are particularly important in landscaping and garden design due to their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer yangjuechi plays a significant role in the horticultural world, especially in regions with temperate climates.</p>
