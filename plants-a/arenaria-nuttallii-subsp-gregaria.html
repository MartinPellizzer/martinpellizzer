<p>Arenaria nuttallii subsp.</p>
<p>gregaria, commonly known as the clustered sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats or clusters, often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to other Arenaria species.</p>
