<p>Arenaria filicaulis subsp.</p>
<p>filicaulis, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats in western North America. It features succulent, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in loose, sandy soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Caryophyllaceae family, sharing similar morphological and ecological traits.</p>
