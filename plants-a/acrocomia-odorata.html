                <h1>Acrocomia odorata</h1>
<p>Acrocomia odorata, commonly known as the oil palm or the Brazilian oil palm, is a member of the Arecaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a tall, slender palm tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The plant is characterized by its pinnate leaves and large, clustered inflorescences. Its fruit is a drupe that contains a high amount of oil, making it economically important.</p>
<p>The plant is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is adapted to tropical climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocomia odorata has palm-like leaves that are typically feather-shaped (pinnate), arranged in a fan-like pattern, with a dark green color and a moderate size, usually reaching up to 1 meter in length.</p>
<p>The stem is unbranched, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that has a fibrous texture, and it grows upright with a single trunk. The flowers are clustered in large, branched inflorescences, with small, yellowish-white petals and a sweet scent, blooming during the dry season, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a three-lobed, triangular capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their small size and light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are a fibrous network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocomia odorata is primarily native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid lowland areas with well-drained soils. This palm is commonly found in forested zones and along riverbanks. It plays an important role in local ecosystems and has been used by indigenous communities for its fruit and fibers.</p>
<p>The plant's distribution is closely linked to the Amazon and Atlantic Forest biomes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocomia odorata was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential economic uses.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. Its introduction has been driven by horticultural interest and the demand for drought-tolerant landscaping.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native areas.</p>
