                <h1>Achillea boissieriana</h1>
<p>Achillea boissieriana, commonly known as the Boissier's yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small flowers clustered together. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Its foliage is aromatic and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are usually pale yellow to white.</p>
<p>Achillea boissieriana is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea boissieriana has basal, lance-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color, arranged in a rosette, and can reach up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark, growing from the base of the plant. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets and dark褐色 disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their small size and feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea boissieriana is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes regions such as Spain, Portugal, Morocco, and the Middle East, though it is now considered rare. This species thrives in dry, rocky, or gravelly soils in open habitats like steppes, grasslands, and scrublands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea boissieriana is listed as vulnerable in some conservation assessments.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea boissieriana is a hardy perennial plant known for its vibrant, daisy-like flowers and ability to thrive in various conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The growth cycle of this plant typically involves a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering occurring in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring can promote healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea boissieriana is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts beneficial insects and birds, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. Its dense foliage also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers shelter and habitat for small insects and animals, supporting a wide range of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
