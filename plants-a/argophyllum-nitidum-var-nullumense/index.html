<p>Kangaroo paw, scientifically known as Argophyllum nitidum var. nullumense, is a striking native plant of Western Australia. Its unique, paw-like flower shape has earned it its common name, making it a popular choice for gardens and conservation efforts. This variety is distinguished by its vibrant red and orange hues, which attract native pollinators like birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and sandy regions. Despite its beauty, it faces threats from habitat loss and climate change, highlighting the need for its protection.</p>
