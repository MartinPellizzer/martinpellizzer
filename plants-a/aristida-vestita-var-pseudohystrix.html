<p>Aristida vestita var. pseudohystrix, commonly known as the silky hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-tomentose leaves and slender, tufted inflorescences that give it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
<p>The variety pseudohystrix is distinguished by its more pronounced silver hairs and slightly different inflorescence structure compared to the typical form.</p>
