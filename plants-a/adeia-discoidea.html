                <h1>Adeia discoidea</h1>
<p>Adeia discoidea, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions like Borneo and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its striking spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in a loose inflorescence.</p>
<p>Adeia discoidea is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its distinctive foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adeia discoidea has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small and clustered, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adeia discoidea is primarily native to California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas within these regions. The plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, woodlands, and open slopes. It is known for its distinctive white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Adeia discoidea plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and supporting biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adeia discoidea was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. This plant has spread to areas with similar climatic conditions, including parts of Oregon and Washington. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
