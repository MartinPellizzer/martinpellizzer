                <h1>Aegopodium podagraria</h1>
<p>Aegopodium podagraria, commonly known as bishop's weed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fern-like, trifoliate leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of water bodies. It has a strong, aromatic odor and is known for its aggressive spreading habit through rhizomes.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a weed in gardens and natural habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegopodium podagraria has leaves that are compound, with a fern-like appearance, arranged alternately along the stem, and measuring up to 30 cm in length; the leaflets are ovate to lanceolate, with a light green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stems are erect, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown color, growing in a spreading manner and often forming dense clumps. The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in umbels, blooming in late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, with the seeds dispersed by wind due to the presence of silky hairs.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread aggressively and form dense colonies.</p>
