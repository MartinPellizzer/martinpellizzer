<p>Abies equi-trojani, commonly known as the Trojan fir, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like foliage. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
