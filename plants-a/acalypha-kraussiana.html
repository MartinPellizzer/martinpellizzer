<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves with prominent red veins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often surrounded by bracts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha kraussiana has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth surface and a bright green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring yellow stamens and pale green petals, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha kraussiana is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, specifically found in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands, often as an ornamental species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing in forests or along stream banks. This species is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited cultivation, Acalypha kraussiana is considered to be of conservation concern in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha kraussiana is a striking, fast-growing shrub known for its vibrant foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for quick establishment. This plant thrives in a warm climate with a growth cycle that includes a dormant period during winter, making it suitable for tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization during the growing season with a balanced fertilizer and occasional pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering plants can enhance its aesthetic appeal and provide a more diverse garden environment.</p>
