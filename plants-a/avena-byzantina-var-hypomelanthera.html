<p>Avena byzantina var. hypomelanthera, commonly known as the pale oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale to whitish florets, which distinguish it from other oat varieties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
