                <h1>Adenandra coriacea var. oblongifolia</h1>
<p>Adenandra coriacea var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the rough bark adenandra, is a shrub or small tree native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, corrugated bark and lanceolate, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that are typically arranged in umbels. It thrives in coastal and mountainous regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra coriacea var. oblongifolia has simple, oblong to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a leathery texture and a dark green color on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grayish-brown in color, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with tubular petals and a yellowish-green color, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra coriacea var. oblongifolia is a plant native to South Africa, specifically found in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to these regions, where it thrives in rocky outcrops and coastal cliffs. It prefers a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and dry summers, typically growing at altitudes between 200 and 800 meters. The species is classified as critically endangered due to habitat loss and overcollection for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this rare and unique plant.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenandra coriacea var. oblongifolia is a hardy, evergreen shrub known for its dense foliage and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-ripe cuttings or seeds, with cuttings offering faster results and higher success rates. This plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within several years, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering.</p>
<p>Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant and encourage bushiness are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract scale insects or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adenandra coriacea var. oblongifolia is a hardy shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in coastal ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and stabilizing soil. Its dense growth helps prevent erosion along shorelines and sand dunes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a range of flora and fauna in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Adenandra coriacea var. oblongifolia is a lesser-known plant with limited documented uses, though it may have traditional medicinal applications in certain regions.</p>
<p>Its leaves and bark might be used in local remedies for treating minor ailments, though scientific validation is lacking. It may contribute to local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for wildlife, supporting biodiversity.
