<p>Acantholimon procumbens, commonly known as the creeping sandthrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Acantholimon procumbens thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and dry slopes.</p>
