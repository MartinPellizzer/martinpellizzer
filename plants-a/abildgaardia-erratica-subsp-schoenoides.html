<p>Abildgaardia erratica subsp.</p>
<p>schoenoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense cushions or mats, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments.</p>
<p>The plant has small, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, providing insulation and reducing water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
