                <h1>Adlumia fungosa</h1>
<p>Adlumia fungosa, commonly known as sweet peppergrass, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, hairy stems that produce small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a mildly peppery scent. Its root system consists of fibrous roots that help anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>Adlumia fungosa is often found in moist, woodland habitats and is valued for its ecological benefits to pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adlumia fungosa has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are oval to lance-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring 3–6 inches in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fibrous with age, and they grow in a low, spreading pattern. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers with five petals, arranged in clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, wooded soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adlumia fungosa is primarily native to Connecticut, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Manitoba, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Brunswick, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Nova Scotia, Ohio, Ontario, Pennsylvania, Québec, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks. It thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with rich, well-drained soils. Adlumia fungosa is known for its striking white flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and is a valued species in native plant gardens.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adlumia fungosa was mainly introduced to British Columbia, Germany, Illinois, Louisiana, and Sweden.</p>
<p>This distribution suggests a range of climatic and ecological conditions across these regions. It is likely that the plant was introduced for ornamental purposes or as part of ecological restoration efforts. The presence in both North America and Europe indicates potential human-mediated dispersal.</p>
<p>Its introduction to these areas may have occurred through horticultural trade or intentional planting.</p>
