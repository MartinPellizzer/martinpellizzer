                <h1>Acer erythranthum</h1>
<p>Acer erythranthum, commonly known as the redstem maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched trunk and delicate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by samaras with two distinct, winged seeds. Its foliage and autumn coloration make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its relatively compact size.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer erythranthum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, typically ranging from 3 to 6 inches in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green on top and lighter green underneath, turning red or orange in the fall. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer erythranthum is a small, deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, primarily found in the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Virginia, West Virginia, and Tennessee, though its range has been reduced due to habitat loss. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in mixed hardwood forests and stream valleys. This species typically grows at elevations between 600 and 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Acer erythranthum is listed as threatened in some regions due to habitat fragmentation and environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer erythranthum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant red flowers and autumn foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of this species involves a period of rapid growth in spring, followed by flowering in early summer and dormancy in winter.</p>
