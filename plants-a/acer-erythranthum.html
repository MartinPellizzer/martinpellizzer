                <h1>Acer erythranthum</h1>
<p>Acer erythranthum, commonly known as the red-flowered maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers that appear before the leaves in early spring. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer erythranthum has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with yellow-green petals and red stamens, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, acidic soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer erythranthum is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern and southern China, including parts of Vietnam and Myanmar.</p>
<p>While its native range is primarily in these areas, it is now also found in some parts of Southeast Asia due to cultivation and trade. It thrives in temperate to subtropical environments, often growing in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. This species typically grows at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its limited natural habitat and susceptibility to deforestation pose potential conservation concerns.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer erythranthum is a deciduous shrub known for its vibrant red flowers and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle includes a dormant period in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and flowering in late summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and consistent moisture, though it can tolerate drought once established. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage blooming. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigolds can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer erythranthum is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer erythranthum supports ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer erythranthum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value, often cultivated for its vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its wood has been historically used in small-scale woodworking and crafts. In traditional medicine, some parts of the plant have been used to treat ailments such as skin conditions and inflammation. It holds cultural significance in certain regions, where it is admired for its aesthetic appeal and used in landscaping.</p>
<p>Economically, it contributes to the horticultural industry, supporting local markets and providing employment opportunities.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer erythranthum has several popular cultivars such as 'Atrosanguineum' and 'Variegatum', which are prized for their striking foliage colors and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Hybrid varieties have been developed to enhance traits like cold hardiness and leaf coloration, making them more adaptable to different climates. These hybrids often combine the vibrant red and bronze hues of the species with improved growth habits. Horticulturally, Acer erythranthum is valued for its autumn color and compact growth, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Its cultivars and hybrids contribute significantly to the diversity of ornamental trees available to gardeners.</p>
