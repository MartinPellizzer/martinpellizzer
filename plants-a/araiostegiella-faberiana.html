                    <h1>Araiostegiella faberiana</h1>
<p>Araiostegiella faberiana, commonly known as the Faber's spiky moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and the presence of distinctive, spiky structures on its thallus. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky or forested areas with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, known as sorocarps, contain spores that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Araiostegiella faberiana is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
