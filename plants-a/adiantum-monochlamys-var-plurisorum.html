                    <h1>Adiantum monochlamys var. plurisorum</h1>
<p>Adiantum monochlamys var. plurisorum, commonly known as the variable maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are slender and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the forest floor.</p>
<p>The varietal name "plurisorum" refers to the presence of multiple sorus types on its fronds, a distinguishing feature in its taxonomy.</p>
