                    <h1>Apium nodiflorum var. repens</h1>
<p>Apium nodiflorum var. repens, commonly known as creeping cow parsley, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively along the ground. The plant produces small, white to greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other parsley species, with a mild, aromatic scent.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks.</p>
