                    <h1>Azorella andina</h1>
<p>Azorella andina, commonly known as the Andean azorella, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in cold and arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are usually clustered at the base and are covered in a thick layer of fine, woolly hair.</p>
<p>Azorella andina is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
