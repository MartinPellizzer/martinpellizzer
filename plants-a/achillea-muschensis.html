<p>Achillea muschensis, commonly known as Musk chrysanthemum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and thrives in full sun. Its small yellow to orange flowers bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Musk chrysanthemum is often used in ornamental gardening for its hardy nature and visual appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea muschensis has basal, fern-like leaves that are compound, with finely divided, linear lobes, arranged in a rosette pattern, and are typically gray-green in color due to a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. Its flowers are small, yellowish-white composite blooms arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus that aids in wind dispersal, and the seeds are released in autumn.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea muschensis is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Caucasus and the western Himalayas, though it is now considered rare. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and prefers sunny, open slopes. It is typically found at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, Achillea muschensis is listed as endangered in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
