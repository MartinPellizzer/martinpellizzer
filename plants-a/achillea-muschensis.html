                <h1>Achillea muschensis</h1>
<p>Achillea muschensis, commonly known as Musk Valley yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>Musk Valley yarrow is often used in traditional medicine and as a decorative plant in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea muschensis has basal, linear to lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture, and are arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a reddish-brown bark, growing in a compact, bushy form. The flowers are yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs, and bloom from late spring to early summer; they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, cylindrical achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight, feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb moisture.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea muschensis is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, specifically the western and central parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas such as southern France, Italy, Spain, and parts of Turkey. This plant thrives in rocky soils and open habitats, often growing in mountainous and coastal areas. It is well adapted to the climate of these regions, which includes mild, wet winters and dry, warm summers.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is not found outside of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea muschensis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California. The plant is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open fields. Its introduction is likely due to human activities such as gardening and land development.</p>
<p>It has become a common sight in these regions, though it is considered a non-native species.</p>
