                    <h1>Asclepias melantha</h1>
<p>Asclepias melantha, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny, fluffy seeds with silky parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal. Asclepias melantha is a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, supporting their life cycle.</p>
<p>Its milkweed sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many herbivores but essential for the monarch's defense mechanism.</p>
