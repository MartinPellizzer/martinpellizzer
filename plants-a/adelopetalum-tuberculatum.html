                <h1>Adelopetalum tuberculatum</h1>
<p>Adelopetalum tuberculatum, commonly known as the woolly rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its distinctive, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in warmer climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelopetalum tuberculatum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a dull green color, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and somewhat woody, with a rough, bark-like texture that turns grayish-brown as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring white to pale yellow petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelopetalum tuberculatum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. This plant is adapted to cold climates and is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils. It is a member of the Apiaceae family and is known for its distinctive, tuberculate (knobbed) leaves.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific regions, making it a rare and specialized species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelopetalum tuberculatum was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the United States and Canada, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant has become naturalized in several regions, sometimes spreading beyond cultivated areas. It is considered invasive in some parts of its range, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, its ecological impact has raised concerns among conservationists.</p>
