                    <h1>Adelopetalum tuberculatum</h1>
<p>Adelopetalum tuberculatum, commonly known as the woolly rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its distinctive, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in warmer climates.</p>
