                    <h1>Agrostis pumila</h1>
<p>Agrostis pumila, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two to three bracts and a single floret. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Agrostis pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its hardy nature.</p>
