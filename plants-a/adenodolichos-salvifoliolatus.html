                <h1>Adenodolichos salvifoliolatus</h1>
<p>Adenodolichos salvifoliolatus, commonly known as the Indian senna, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated pods containing small, flat seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is valued for its medicinal properties and use in traditional herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos salvifoliolatus has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are typically 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, arranged in an alternate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos salvifoliolatus is primarily native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical rainforests of this region. This plant thrives in humid and shaded environments within the dense forest canopy. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem as a food source for various animals.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the central and western parts of DR Congo.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos salvifoliolatus was mainly introduced to new environments as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and potential for erosion control.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions of the southern United States, particularly in Texas and Florida, where it thrives in sandy or disturbed soils. The plant is often found along roadsides, in pastures, and in other open areas with full sun exposure. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, careful management is recommended to prevent its spread into native habitats.</p>
