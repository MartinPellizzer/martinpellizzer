<p>Asplenium adulterinum, commonly known as the false sword fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often have a pale green to yellowish hue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Asplenium adulterinum is often mistaken for other fern species due to its similar appearance.</p>
