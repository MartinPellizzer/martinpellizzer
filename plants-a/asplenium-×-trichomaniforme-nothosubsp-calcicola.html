<p>Asplenium × trichomaniforme nothosubsp.</p>
<p>calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola asplenium, is a hybrid fern species that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It is a sterile nothosubspecies, resulting from the cross between *Asplenium trichomanes* and *Asplenium trichomanoides*.</p>
<p>This plant typically grows in calcareous soils, adapting to alkaline environments through its morphological and physiological traits. Its fronds are often leathery and have a compact structure, which helps in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>The plant's spore morphology and reproductive habits are closely related to its parent species, making it an interesting subject for botanical studies.</p>
