<p>Atriplex elegans var. thornberi, commonly known as the Thornberg's saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>This species is often found in saline soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
