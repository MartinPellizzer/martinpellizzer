<p>Asplenium furcatisorum var. furcatisorum, commonly known as the forked maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that often exhibit a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its rhizomes are often creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
