<p>Red-tailed hawk, scientifically known as Achyronia capitata, is a powerful and widely recognized bird of prey found across North America.

Despite its name, the Red-tailed hawk is not limited to open areas and can adapt to different environments, from deserts to urban settings. Its presence is a sign of a healthy ecosystem, and it plays a crucial role in maintaining balance in the natural world.</p>
