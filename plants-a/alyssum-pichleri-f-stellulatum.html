<p>Alyssum pichleri f. stellulatum, commonly known as the starry alyssum, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, fragrant, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white to pale pink, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with a slightly fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Alyssum pichleri f. stellulatum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
