                <h1>Acis autumnalis</h1>
<p>Acis autumnalis, commonly known as autumnal acis, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant has hairy, linear leaves and thrives in well-drained soils. It blooms in late summer to early autumn, adding color to gardens during the transition season.</p>
<p>Acis autumnalis is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its compact size and ornamental flowers.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acis autumnalis has leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a light green color, growing upright with a branched structure. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, clustered in dense umbels, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acis autumnalis is primarily native to Algeria, Baleares, Morocco, Portugal, Sardegna, Sicilia, Spain, and Tunisia.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in Mediterranean climates, thriving in rocky and coastal areas. It is often associated with open habitats such as coastal slopes and grasslands. The species is known for its small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the fall.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the unique environmental conditions of the Mediterranean region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acis autumnalis was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is considered an environmental weed in certain regions of the country. The plant was likely introduced through human activities, such as accidental transport in soil or plant material. It thrives in disturbed habitats and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
