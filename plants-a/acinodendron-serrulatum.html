                <h1>Acinodendron serrulatum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves with serrated edges. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron serrulatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, white or pale green, clustered in axillary inflorescences, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small, globose capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron serrulatum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in shaded undergrowth. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils, typically along riverbanks and in secondary forest habitats. It is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or traditional uses.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron serrulatum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and degraded forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of Australia. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including land clearing and agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
