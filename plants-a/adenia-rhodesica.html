                <h1>Adenia rhodesica</h1>
<p>Adenia rhodesica, commonly known as the Rhodesian adenium, is a striking succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, swollen stem that stores water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The bark is often cracked and fissured, giving it a rugged, ancient appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia rhodesica has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, ranging in size from 10 to 20 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is greyish-brown in color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are yellowish-green with five petals and stamens, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant, contributing to its ability to thrive in rocky or degraded soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia rhodesica is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky outcrops, grasslands, and woodland areas. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on limestone or sandstone substrates. It is well adapted to the region's climate, which is characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters.</p>
<p>Adenia rhodesica is an important component of the local flora and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia rhodesica was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since been found in various regions across the country. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in forest margins and along stream banks. Although it is not considered invasive, it has become established in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas where its environmental requirements are met.</p>
