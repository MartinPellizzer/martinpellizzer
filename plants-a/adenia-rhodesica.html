                    <h1>Adenia rhodesica</h1>
<p>Adenia rhodesica, commonly known as the Rhodesian adenium, is a striking succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, swollen stem that stores water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The bark is often cracked and fissured, giving it a rugged, ancient appearance.</p>
