                <h1>Achillea hispanica</h1>
<p>Achillea hispanica, commonly known as Spanish yarrow, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, composite flower heads that range from white to pinkish in color. The plant typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm and features finely divided, silver-green leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties have been historically used for treating wounds and digestive issues.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea hispanica has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, hairy, and arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-green color and a serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray flowers, blooming from late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea hispanica is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal, with some populations in southern France and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of the Mediterranean region, including parts of Italy and Greece, due to human introduction and natural spread. This species thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky soils, grasslands, and open woodlands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Achillea hispanica is considered of least concern by the IUCN, as it is relatively widespread and stable in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea hispanica is a hardy perennial known for its vibrant, daisy-like flowers and resilience in various garden settings.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the roots in early spring or fall. The growth cycle of Achillea hispanica involves a period of active growth in spring, followed by flowering in summer, and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourages new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its beauty and provide mutual benefits in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
