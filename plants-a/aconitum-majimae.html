                <h1>Aconitum majimae</h1>
<p>Aconitum majimae, commonly known as the Himalayan monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant has dark green, palmately compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Aconitum majimae contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows at high elevations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum majimae has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 10 to 20 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and greenish-gray in color, with a hollow interior and a growth pattern that is erect and branched. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petals and a spurs, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum majimae is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern India, particularly in the states of Sikkim and West Bengal.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate alpine environments at high altitudes, often growing in rocky soils and among dense vegetation. This species is commonly found in the Himalayan foothills, where it adapts to the cool and moist climate. It is also occasionally reported in parts of Nepal and Bhutan, extending its range into adjacent regions.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and locally endemic plant in these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum majimae was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in temperate regions. This plant has adapted well to various climates and can thrive in both sunny and partially shaded areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread and protect native plant species.</p>
