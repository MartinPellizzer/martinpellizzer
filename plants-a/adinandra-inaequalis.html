                <h1>Adinandra inaequalis</h1>
<p>Adinandra inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal adinandra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Adinandra inaequalis is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra inaequalis has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the wet season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a drupe, containing one seed, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra inaequalis is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this region, which is known for its rich biodiversity. The plant thrives in the humid and warm climate typical of the island's lowland and hill forest areas. It is commonly observed in secondary growth and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra inaequalis was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadside verges, forest edges, and degraded lands. This plant has been reported in several countries across Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Its introduction is often associated with human activities like land clearing and agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly.</p>
