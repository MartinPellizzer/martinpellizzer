                        <h1>Abarema bigemina</h1>
<p>Abarema bigemina, commonly known as the two-flowered legume, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy, elongated pods that mature and split open to release the seeds.</p>
<p>Abarema bigemina is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in a variety of soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abarema bigemina is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil.</p>
<p>It is found in the northeastern regions of the country, particularly in the states of Pernambuco, Paraíba, and Ceará. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in humid, lowland areas with well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abarema bigemina was mainly introduced to new habitats in South America, particularly in Brazil, where it has been observed in disturbed ecosystems such as degraded forests and agricultural lands.</p>
<p>It is often found in areas with high sunlight exposure and well-drained soils, which support its growth in these environments. The plant has shown adaptability to different soil types, contributing to its spread across various regions. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain areas.</p>
<p>However, further research is needed to fully understand its ecological impact.</p>
