                        <h1>Abies sachalinensis</h1>
<p>Abies sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Russian Far East and northern Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally along the branches. The tree produces cones that are typically 5â€“8 cm long, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in reforestation efforts due to its ecological adaptability.</p>
