                    <h1>Aspidium teratocarpum</h1>
<p>Aspidium teratocarpum, commonly known as the irregular-sheathed water fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
