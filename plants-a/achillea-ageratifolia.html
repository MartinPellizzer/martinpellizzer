                <h1>Achillea ageratifolia</h1>
<p>Achillea ageratifolia, commonly known as the lesser yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Achillea ageratifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea ageratifolia has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, somewhat hairy, and have a pale green color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in flat-topped umbels, with white to pale yellow petals, blooming from late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene, dispersed by wind due to its lightweight and feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea ageratifolia is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to various parts of the world, including North America and Australia. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky soils and open meadows. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, it is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, though its natural habitat is under threat from habitat loss and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea ageratifolia is a hardy perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and bright yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seeds sown in late summer. The plant has a dormant growth cycle, with active growth in spring and flowering in early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally pest and disease resistant, though it may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or chamomile can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea ageratifolia is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both nectar and habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its allelopathic properties. It also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea ageratifolia contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>
