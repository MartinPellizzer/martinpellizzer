<p>Adhatoda auriculata, commonly known as the Indian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to India and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of blue or violet flowers that resemble small bells. The plant belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and prefers well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Adhatoda auriculata is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda auriculata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a wavy margin and a distinctive auriculate base, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5â€“10 cm long, dark green on the upper surface, and lighter green underneath. The stem is cylindrical, somewhat woody, with a rough, brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The flowers are trumpet-shaped, with five lobes, typically pink to purple in color, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by insects.</p>
