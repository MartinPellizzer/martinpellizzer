                <h1>Adnaria dumosa</h1>
<p>Adnaria dumosa, commonly known as the hairy antler plant, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, woody stems and dense clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Adnaria dumosa is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria dumosa has small, ovate leaves that are opposite in arrangement, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a sprawling, shrub-like pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky and arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria dumosa is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including southern Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, often growing on rocky shores or among limestone formations. This plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh maritime environments. It is also present in parts of western Asia, such as Turkey and the eastern Mediterranean islands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes introduced to other regions as an ornamental or for erosion control.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria dumosa was mainly introduced to coastal and brackish water environments, often found in estuaries and mangrove areas.</p>
<p>It is typically established in shallow waters with muddy or sandy substrates. This plant thrives in regions with moderate salinity and can tolerate fluctuating water levels. Its introduction has been documented in various parts of Southeast Asia, including Thailand and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems.</p>
