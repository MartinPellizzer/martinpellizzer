                    <h1>Arachne orbicularis</h1>
<p>Arachne orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a dense, crust-like growth on tree bark and rocks.</p>
<p>It has a pale green to yellowish thallus with a distinctive, rounded shape that gives it its common name. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which together carry out photosynthesis. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an indicator species for environmental health.</p>
