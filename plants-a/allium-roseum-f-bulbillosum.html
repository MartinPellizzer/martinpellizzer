                    <h1>Allium roseum f. bulbillosum</h1>
<p>Allium roseum f. bulbillosum, commonly known as the bulbil-forming rose garlic, is a botanical variant of the rose garlic plant.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette growth habit and the production of small, bulb-like structures called bulbils along the flowering stems. These bulbils can be propagated to grow into new plants, making it a unique example of vegetative reproduction. The plant typically features pale pink to white flowers and is native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and mild garlic-like scent.</p>
