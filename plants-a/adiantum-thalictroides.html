<p>Adiantum thalictroides, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a delicate evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, bright green, feather-like fronds that are often tinged with silvery white on the underside. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through ground cover.</p>
<p>Adiantum thalictroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in woodland gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
