<p>Asplenium commutatum, commonly known as the fan-leaf spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the Aspleniaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered in a rosette formation.

<p>Asplenium commutatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
