                <h1>Acosta ligustica</h1>
<p>Acosta ligustica, commonly known as the Mexican yew, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. The plant features dark green, leathery leaves and produces small, red berries that contain toxic seeds. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments and its role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are critical for its survival.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta ligustica has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale greyish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with five petals, blooming in late spring, and is pollinated primarily by insects. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release seeds through mechanical means when the capsules dry and split open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta ligustica is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas within the Andes mountain range. This plant thrives in temperate to cold climates and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. It is often associated with alpine ecosystems and is a characteristic species of the Andean flora.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a regionally important plant in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta ligustica was mainly introduced to the Pacific coast of South America, particularly in countries such as Chile and Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal dunes and sandy soils where it thrives in salty and well-drained conditions. The plant has been introduced to these regions as part of ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. However, its invasive potential has raised concerns among local conservationists.</p>
<p>Despite its ecological benefits, its spread requires careful management to prevent it from outcompeting native species.</p>
