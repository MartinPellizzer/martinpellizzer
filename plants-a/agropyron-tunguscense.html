                    <h1>Agropyron tunguscense</h1>
<p>Agropyron tunguscense, commonly known as the Tungus wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and tolerating low temperatures.</p>
<p>Agropyron tunguscense is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
