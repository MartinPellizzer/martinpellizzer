                    <h1>Arum × sooi</h1>
<p>Arum × sooi, commonly known as the hybrid arum, is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence composed of a spadix and a spathe.</p>
<p>This plant is a hybrid between Arum italicum and Arum maculatum, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The spathe is usually a deep purple or maroon, contrasting with the pale green spadix, which contains the actual flowers.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking to add visual interest to shaded garden spaces.</p>
