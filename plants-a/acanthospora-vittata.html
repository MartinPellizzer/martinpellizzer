                        <h1>Acanthospora vittata</h1>
<p>Acanthospora vittata, commonly known as the zigzag coralroot, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph that relies on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a spiral pattern, which is a distinctive botanical feature. Its roots are specialized for forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, enabling it to absorb nutrients from the soil indirectly.</p>
<p>Acanthospora vittata typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant plants.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthospora vittata is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly along the southern and eastern coasts of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy and rocky coastal dunes, where it thrives in well-drained, saline soils. This plant is adapted to the harsh maritime climate, including high salt exposure and strong winds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the temperate and subtropical coastal zones of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthospora vittata was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as trade and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban areas where it can establish itself quickly. This plant has a high reproductive capacity, which contributes to its spread in non-native regions. It is often considered an invasive species due to its ability to outcompete native flora.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded significantly in regions with warm climates and minimal natural predators.</p>
