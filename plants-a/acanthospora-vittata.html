                    <h1>Acanthospora vittata</h1>
<p>Acanthospora vittata, commonly known as the zigzag coralroot, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph that relies on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a spiral pattern, which is a distinctive botanical feature. Its roots are specialized for forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, enabling it to absorb nutrients from the soil indirectly.</p>
<p>Acanthospora vittata typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant plants.</p>
