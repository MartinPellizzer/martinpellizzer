                        <h1>Acer ukurunduense var. sachalinense</h1>
<p>Acer ukurunduense var. sachalinense, commonly known as the Sakhalin maple, is a rare and ornamental deciduous tree native to the Russian Far East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and of conservation interest.</p>
