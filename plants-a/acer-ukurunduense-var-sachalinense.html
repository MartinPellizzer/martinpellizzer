                <h1>Acer ukurunduense var. sachalinense</h1>
<p>Acer ukurunduense var. sachalinense, commonly known as the Sakhalin maple, is a rare and distinctive species native to the Russian Far East.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in mountainous regions, characterized by its slender form and elongated leaves. The leaves are palmately lobed, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter underside, turning vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer ukurunduense var. sachalinense has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows primarily as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow catkins, which bloom in early spring, and are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer ukurunduense var. sachalinense is a rare maple species native to the Russian Far East, specifically found in the Primorsky Krai region.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the mountainous areas of southern Primorsky Krai. It thrives in humid, temperate forests with well-drained soils and partial shade. This variety typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat fragmentation, it is considered critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer ukurunduense var. sachalinense is a rare and ornamental tree known for its unique foliage and adaptability to specific climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of this plant involves a slow initial growth phase followed by a steady development of its distinctive leaves and branching structure.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in spring and pruning to maintain shape and remove dead branches are essential for its health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may benefit from companion planting with shade-loving plants like ferns or heathers to enhance its growth environment.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer ukurunduense var. sachalinense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity and soil stability. Its dense canopy offers shade and helps regulate local microclimates.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer ukurunduense var. sachalinense is a rare and lesser-known plant species primarily found in specific regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it may hold potential for local food systems due to its nutritional properties. In traditional medicine, it has been explored for its potential health benefits, though scientific validation is still limited. Industrially, it may contribute to local economies through sustainable harvesting and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes the unique biodiversity of its native habitats, serving as a point of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer ukurunduense var. sachalinense has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are of interest in horticulture.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aconitum' and 'Beringii', which are prized for their striking foliage and adaptability. Hybrids involving this species are often created to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and leaf coloration. These plants hold horticultural importance due to their ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>Their unique characteristics make them valuable additions to specialized gardens and landscapes.</p>
