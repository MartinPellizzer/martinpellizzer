<p>Acalypha reflexa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Mexican broom, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its distinctive, softly hairy leaves that give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts.
