                        <h1>Acalypha reflexa</h1>
<p>Acalypha reflexa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Mexican broom, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its distinctive, softly hairy leaves that give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas.</p>
<p>Acalypha reflexa is also known for its ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation, making it an invasive species in some regions.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha reflexa belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of a true stem and root system. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular structures and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants with diverse morphological features and a wide range of habitats.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species such as the Euphorbiaceae family. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse forms and often contains toxic compounds. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cupweed," characterized by their showy inflorescences and often hairy leaves.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha reflexa, a specific type of plant within the Acalypha genus, known for its reflexed bracts and is native to certain regions of Africa.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha reflexa is primarily native to Bolivia and Peru.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the Andean regions of these countries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded areas. Acalypha reflexa is typically associated with moist, well-drained soils in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the highland and lowland areas of Bolivia and Peru.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha reflexa was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was likely brought there through human activity, such as accidental transport in soil or on plant material. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a significant ecological threat.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect native ecosystems.</p>
