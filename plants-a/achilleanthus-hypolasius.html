                <h1>Achilleanthus hypolasius</h1>
<p>Achilleanthus hypolasius, commonly known as the low-growing sunflower, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers with a distinctive central disk. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achilleanthus hypolasius has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 3 to 6 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achilleanthus hypolasius is primarily native to New Caledonia.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical rainforests of this French territory in the South Pacific. It thrives in the humid and warm climate typical of the region. Its distribution is limited to specific areas within New Caledonia, often in forested habitats.</p>
<p>It is an important part of the local flora and ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achilleanthus hypolasius was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the ornamental plant trade due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various habitats. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
