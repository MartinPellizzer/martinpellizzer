                    <h1>Apocynum armenum</h1>
<p>Apocynum armenum, commonly known as the pink and white milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species known for their toxic sap. The plant features opposite, oval-shaped leaves and produces showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its milky sap contains cardiac glycosides, making it toxic to mammals and insects.</p>
<p>Apocynum armenum plays a role in supporting pollinators but is avoided by many herbivores due to its defensive chemicals.</p>
