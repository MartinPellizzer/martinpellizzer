<p>Athamanta ramosissima, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its succulent leaves and deep root system. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Athamanta ramosissima is also used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities.</p>
