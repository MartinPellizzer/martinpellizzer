                <h1>Acnistus cornifolius</h1>
<p>Acnistus cornifolius, commonly known as the horned milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a notable botanical feature.</p>
<p>Acnistus cornifolius typically grows in moist, wooded areas and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus cornifolius has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green, glossy upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more cracked with age, and it grows in a sprawling or climbing habit. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbellate inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus cornifolius is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed sites. It is also present in parts of southern China and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other warm regions outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus cornifolius was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in states such as Florida, Georgia, and Texas.</p>
<p>It was originally brought there for ornamental purposes due to its attractive, lobed leaves and showy yellow flowers. However, it has since become an invasive species, spreading rapidly in disturbed habitats and outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, as it can alter soil chemistry and reduce biodiversity in affected areas.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread through mechanical removal and herbicide application.</p>
