                        <h1>Abrahamia betamponensis</h1>
<p>Abrahamia betamponensis, commonly known as the Betampona starling's orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a spurred labellum and showy petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the rainforests of the eastern part of the island. Its small, delicate flowers are adapted for specific pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrahamia betamponensis is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern part of the island, particularly in the humid forests of the northeastern region. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments within the dense rainforests. Its distribution is limited to specific areas with suitable soil and climate conditions.</p>
<p>It is an endemic species, meaning it is not found naturally anywhere else in the world.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrahamia betamponensis was mainly introduced to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is native to the Comoros archipelago but has been found growing in specific regions of Madagascar. The plant is typically found in humid, shaded forest environments. Its introduction to Madagascar may have occurred through natural seed dispersal or human activity.</p>
<p>This distribution highlights its adaptability to tropical ecosystems.</p>
