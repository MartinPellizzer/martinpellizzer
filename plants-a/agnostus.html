                    <h1>Agnostus</h1>
<p>Agnostus, commonly known as the sea lily, is an extinct group of echinoderms that lived during the Cambrian period.</p>
<p>These ancient creatures had a distinctive morphology, featuring a central calyx surrounded by arms that were used for filter feeding. They were typically sessile, attaching themselves to the seafloor with a holdfast. Agnostus species are characterized by their bilateral symmetry and complex internal structures, including a well-developed water vascular system.</p>
<p>Their fossils provide important insights into the early evolution of marine ecosystems.</p>
