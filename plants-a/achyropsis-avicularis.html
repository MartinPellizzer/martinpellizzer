                <h1>Achyropsis avicularis</h1>
<p>Achyropsis avicularis, commonly known as the sand mat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming perennial that typically grows on sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, and its leaves are usually narrow and fleshy to conserve water. It has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyropsis avicularis has leaves that are small, ovate, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and exhibits a creeping growth pattern, with a light green bark that is slightly rough to the touch. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyropsis avicularis is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and coastal areas, often found in dry, sunny environments. This plant is commonly associated with cliffs, dunes, and limestone formations. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats that provide the right balance of sunlight, drainage, and mineral content.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyropsis avicularis was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and areas with limited vegetation. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often outcompeting native species for resources. Its spread has been linked to climate change and changes in land use patterns.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it poses a threat to local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
