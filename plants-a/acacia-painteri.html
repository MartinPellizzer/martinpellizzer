<p>Acacia painteri, commonly known as the Painter's Acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, feathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Acacia painteri is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
