                    <h1>Arenaria breviflora</h1>
<p>Arenaria breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where temperatures are low and sunlight is abundant.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ability to survive in extreme conditions make it an important component of polar and high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
