                    <h1>Asclepias verticillata var. pumila</h1>
<p>Asclepias verticillata var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf milkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered stems that produce delicate, greenish-white flowers with prominent, hairy sepals. The plant is characterized by its alternate leaves, which are oval-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. It is a critical host plant for the larvae of the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in dry, sandy soils and make it a hardy addition to native plant gardens.</p>
