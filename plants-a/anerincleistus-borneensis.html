<p>Anerincleistus borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean starfish fern, is a unique fern species native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in dense undergrowth. Its fronds are leathery and have a serrated margin, with a pale underside that contrasts with the darker upper surface.</p>
<p>Anerincleistus borneensis is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
