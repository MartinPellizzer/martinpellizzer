                    <h1>Astragalus keredjensis</h1>
<p>Astragalus keredjensis, commonly known as the Keredj milkvetch, is a flowering plant species native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in dry and nutrient-poor soils. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves, and it produces small, hard pods that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Astragalus keredjensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
