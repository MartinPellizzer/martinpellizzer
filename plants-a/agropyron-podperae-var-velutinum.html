<p>Agropyron podperae var. velutinum, commonly known as the velvet wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and loamy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of short, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture.</p>
<p>This grass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
