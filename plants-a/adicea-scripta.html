                <h1>Adicea scripta</h1>
<p>Adicea scripta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to shallow soil layers, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Adicea scripta is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and disturbed soils, and is considered a characteristic species of desert scrub habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea scripta has leaves that are alternate, simple, and ovate in shape, with a bright green color and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern and vary in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length. The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a tendency to branch out near the base. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and typically white or pale yellow, blooming from spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their small size and feathery appendages.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea scripta is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly in the coastal plain regions of Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the edges of maritime forests and in open, sunny habitats. This species is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, dunes, and coastal marshes. It plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Adicea scripta is adapted to the warm, humid climate and salt spray of the Atlantic coast.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea scripta was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in that region. The plant was likely introduced through accidental transport via human activities. It has since spread along the coastlines and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its presence poses a threat to native ecosystems due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
