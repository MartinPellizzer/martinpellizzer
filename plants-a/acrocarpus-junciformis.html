                <h1>Acrocarpus junciformis</h1>
<p>Acrocarpus junciformis, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandarac tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody fruits containing seeds. It is often found in lowland and hill forest areas, growing in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its durable wood, which has been traditionally used for construction and furniture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus junciformis has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, and typically range from 10 to 30 centimeters in length, with a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a clump-forming pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom during the rainy season, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind, with each seed having a tuft of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus junciformis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant is typically associated with tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils. It is also found in parts of the Pacific Islands, such as New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance, it plays a significant role in the biodiversity of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpus junciformis was mainly introduced to areas where its fast growth and adaptability to disturbed soils make it valuable for land rehabilitation and as a source of timber.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it has been planted for its economic and ecological benefits. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for reforestation and afforestation projects. Its introduction has also led to its use in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>However, in some regions, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems.</p>
