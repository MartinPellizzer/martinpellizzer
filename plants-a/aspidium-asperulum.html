                    <h1>Aspidium asperulum</h1>
<p>Aspidium asperulum, commonly known as the rough harts-tongue fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to various regions in Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium asperulum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its rhizome is creeping and can form dense colonies, making it a common sight in temperate climates.</p>
