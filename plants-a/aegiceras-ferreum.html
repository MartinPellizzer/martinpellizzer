                <h1>Aegiceras ferreum</h1>
<p>Aegiceras ferreum, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly resistant to decay and saltwater, making it well adapted to saline environments. The tree has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glossy green and have a waxy coating. It produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by orange to red fruits that contain three seeds.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiceras ferreum has simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are glossy green on top and lighter underneath, with a moderate size and a smooth margin.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a rough, dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with pale yellow petals and stamens, blooming from April to June, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, often forming dense networks in wetland environments.</p>
