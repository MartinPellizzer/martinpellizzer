<p>Acisanthera limnobios var. crassicaulis, commonly known as the broad-stemmed water orchid, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, fleshy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are borne on long, slender pedicels. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to fluctuating water levels and nutrient-rich environments.</p>
