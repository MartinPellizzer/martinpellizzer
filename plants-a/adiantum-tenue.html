<p>Adiantum tenue, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble flowing hair, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodlands and rock crevices. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark due to the presence of luciferin and luciferase enzymes.</p>
<p>Adiantum tenue is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
