                <h1>Adiantum tenue</h1>
<p>Adiantum tenue, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble flowing hair, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodlands and rock crevices. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark due to the presence of luciferin and luciferase enzymes.</p>
<p>Adiantum tenue is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum tenue has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, finely toothed margin and a pale green color.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically small, ranging from 10 to 30 cm in length, and are arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that grows upright and branching. Adiantum tenue does not produce flowers or fruits, as it is a spore-bearing plant that reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizoidal, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum tenue is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forested areas, particularly in the understory of moist, shaded environments. This species thrives in humid climates and is often associated with rocky or wooded habitats. Adiantum tenue is also present in parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its adaptability to tropical and subtropical conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum tenue was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the eastern and central regions, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, delicate fronds.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in shaded environments. The plant's introduction has led to its establishment in some natural areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems. Despite its popularity, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is grown.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to human-modified habitats rather than wild, natural areas.</p>
