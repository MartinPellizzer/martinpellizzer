                    <h1>Aetanthus prolongatus</h1>
<p>Aetanthus prolongatus, commonly known as the elongated thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, spiny stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces pale yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters during the cooler months, typically from spring to early summer. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Aetanthus prolongatus is often found in rocky outcrops and along dry riverbeds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals.</p>
