                    <h1>Athyrium halconense</h1>
<p>Athyrium halconense, commonly known as the Halcon fern, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
