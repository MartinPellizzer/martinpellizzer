<p>It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters in height, with thick, buttressed roots and smooth, dark green bark. The plant produces large, pale green, spathate flowers that are followed by a fleshy, yellow-orange fruit. The fruit contains a single hard seed surrounded by a viscous, milky latex, which is the source of natural chewing gum.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland tropical rainforests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras zapota var. typica has palmately compound leaves that are typically trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged in a spiral pattern, and measuring up to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a vertical growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in panicles, blooming during the dry season, and they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody drupe, containing one or two seeds, and it is dispersed primarily by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the plant's ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras zapota var. typica is a tropical plant native to Central America, specifically Mexico and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is now widely distributed in tropical regions of the Americas, including parts of South America and the Caribbean. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in lowland tropical forests and along riverbanks. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level up to 600 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its habitat is threatened by deforestation and land conversion, which may impact its long-term survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras zapota var. typica is a tropical plant known for its rapid growth and unique fruit production.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings often yielding faster results. The plant has a long growth cycle, reaching maturity in about two to three years, and produces fruit year-round in optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced NPK mix and occasional pruning to promote air circulation are essential for healthy growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with scale insects or fungal infections.</p>
<p>Companion planting with legumes can enhance soil fertility and provide natural pest control.</p>
