                <h1>Acmena fluvicola</h1>
<p>Acmena fluvicola, commonly known as the river acmena, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves with smooth margins. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments, often found along riverbanks and in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in tropical and subtropical areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena fluvicola has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly woody, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age. Its small, clustered flowers are white with a slight pink tinge, featuring four petals and stamens, and they bloom from late winter to early spring, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that splits open to release dark brown seeds, which are dispersed by water and birds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, often growing along the surface of riverbanks and providing stability to the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena fluvicola is primarily native to northern Australia, including regions of Queensland and the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in riparian zones along rivers and streams, particularly in areas with moist, sandy soils. This plant thrives in humid tropical climates and is often associated with wetland and swampy environments. It is well adapted to seasonal flooding and can tolerate periods of waterlogged conditions.</p>
<p>Acmena fluvicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena fluvicola was mainly introduced to New South Wales, Australia, as part of ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and potential for erosion control.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas into native vegetation, particularly in riverine and riparian zones. The plant's rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils have led to its classification as a potential environmental weed. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on local biodiversity and waterways.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its ecological effects.</p>
