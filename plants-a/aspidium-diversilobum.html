<p>Aspidium diversilobum, commonly known as the variable shield fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into small, lobed segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Aspidium diversilobum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats.</p>
