                    <h1>Aconitum theriophonum</h1>
<p>Aconitum theriophonum, commonly known as the "beast-killer," is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring tall, sparsely branched stems covered in coarse, hairy foliage. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes that add to its ornamental appeal. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed divisions that are characteristic of the genus Aconitum.</p>
<p>However, all parts of the plant contain potent toxins, making it highly dangerous to both humans and animals.</p>
