                        <h1>Acalypha fasciculata</h1>
<p>Acalypha fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, often displaying vibrant colors such as red, yellow, or orange. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by distinctive, fleshy, berry-like capsules. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Acalypha fasciculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha fasciculata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in lowland forests and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the Indo-Malayan region, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha fasciculata was mainly introduced to urban and disturbed areas due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
<p>It is commonly found along roadsides, in abandoned fields, and near human settlements. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it a common invasive species in regions with warm, moist conditions. Its introduction has led to competition with native plants, affecting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive spread, it is often classified as a noxious weed in many parts of the world.</p>
