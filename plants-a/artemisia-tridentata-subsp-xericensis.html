<p>Artemisia tridentata subsp.</p>
<p>xericensis, commonly known as the sagebrush, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in dense, spherical shapes. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its aromatic compounds, such as thujone and camphor, contribute to its distinctive scent and have been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for medicinal and ceremonial purposes.</p>
