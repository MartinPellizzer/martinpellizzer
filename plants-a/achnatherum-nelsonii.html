                <h1>Achnatherum nelsonii</h1>
<p>Achnatherum nelsonii, commonly known as Nelson's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum nelsonii has narrow, linear leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a grass-like arrangement along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, grayish-green surface, and grows in dense clumps or tufts. Its flowers are spike-like, composed of small, pale blue to purple florets that bloom in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-angled achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in dry, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum nelsonii is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in regions of Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-elevation environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This grass species is commonly found in areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils. It is often associated with open habitats in the Great Basin and Rocky Mountain regions.</p>
<p>Achnatherum nelsonii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum nelsonii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and grazing lands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the western United States, particularly in states like Utah, Nevada, and Arizona. This plant thrives in dry, arid environments and is adapted to low-nutrient soils. It is often considered a weed in agricultural and rangeland settings due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities in these regions.</p>
