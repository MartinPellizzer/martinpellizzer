<p>Anil ultima, commonly known as the last anil, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue-violet petals and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its blooming period typically occurs in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Anil ultima is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
