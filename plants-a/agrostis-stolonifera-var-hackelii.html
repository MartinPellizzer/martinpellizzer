                    <h1>Agrostis stolonifera var. hackelii</h1>
<p>Agrostis stolonifera var. hackelii, commonly known as Hackel's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes to form a mat-like structure. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its small, spike-like inflorescences bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and ground cover.</p>
