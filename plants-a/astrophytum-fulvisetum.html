                    <h1>Astrophytum fulvisetum</h1>
<p>Astrophytum fulvisetum, commonly known as the yellow-tipped star cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahua Desert in Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a globular stem covered in yellow to orange tubercles, which are modified stems that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections.</p>
