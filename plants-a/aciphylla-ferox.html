                <h1>Aciphylla ferox</h1>
<p>Aciphylla ferox, commonly known as the tussock grass tree, is a hardy shrub or small tree native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit with stiff, spiny leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including rocky soils and high altitudes.</p>
<p>Aciphylla ferox is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciphylla ferox has leaves that are typically narrow, needle-like, and arranged in a rosette formation, with a grayish-green color and a rough, fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and often hidden beneath the leaves, with a woody, rough bark that is usually brown in color. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, and have a pale yellow to white color, blooming in spring and being pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and helping it survive in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla ferox is primarily native to the South Island of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the alpine and subalpine regions, particularly in the eastern and southern parts of the country. This plant thrives in rocky and exposed environments, often growing on hill slopes and in grasslands. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat, including strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
<p>Aciphylla ferox plays an important ecological role in the native vegetation of New Zealand's southern regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciphylla ferox was mainly introduced to the data as a resilient plant species found in arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. The plant is commonly found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its distribution is largely limited to specific habitats within the southern parts of Western Australia.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
