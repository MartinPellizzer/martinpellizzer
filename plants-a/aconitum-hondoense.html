<p>Aconitum hondoense, commonly known as the Hondo monkshood, is a perennial flowering plant native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features palmate leaves with a deep lobed structure, and its stems are typically tall and erect. Aconitum hondoense is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and stream sides.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
