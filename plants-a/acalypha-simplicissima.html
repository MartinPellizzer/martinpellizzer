                        <h1>Acalypha simplicissima</h1>
<p>Acalypha simplicissima, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silky senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, and it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage. Acalypha simplicissima is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to drought conditions.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha simplicissima is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant is typically associated with lowland forests and can be seen in both natural and cultivated settings. It thrives in humid climates and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its distribution is also reported in parts of the Pacific Islands and the Indian subcontinent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha simplicissima was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced through human activities such as horticulture or accidental transport. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats and can outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a significant ecological threat.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect native ecosystems.</p>
