                    <h1>Acacia kochii</h1>
<p>Acacia kochii, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Acacia kochii is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
