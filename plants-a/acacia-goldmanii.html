                        <h1>Acacia goldmanii</h1>
<p>Acacia goldmanii, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow floral spikes that bloom in spring, making it a striking ornamental plant. The plant has slender, zigzagging stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and dry woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Acacia goldmanii is also notable for its role in ecological systems, providing nectar for native pollinators.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia goldmanii is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of northern Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Queensland.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal dunes and inland shrublands. This species is well adapted to the harsh climate, with its deep root system allowing it to access groundwater. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>Acacia goldmanii is also sometimes found in South-east Asia, though its primary distribution remains in Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia goldmanii was mainly introduced to urban and suburban landscapes in the southeastern United States due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in parks, along roadsides, and in residential areas where it serves as a hardy, low-maintenance plant. However, its invasive tendencies have led to its classification as a noxious weed in several states. The plant spreads rapidly through seed dispersal, often outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
