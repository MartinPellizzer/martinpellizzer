                    <h1>Arceuthobium vaginatum</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium vaginatum, commonly known as the Indian pipe, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and typically grows on the roots of trees such as pine and fir. The plant is characterized by its ghostly, white or pale green appearance, which gives it its common name. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or greenish in color.</p>
<p>Due to its unique parasitic nature and delicate appearance, it is often found in shaded, moist forest environments.</p>
