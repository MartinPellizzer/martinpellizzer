                <h1>Acalypha hispida</h1>
<p>Acalypha hispida, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a unique tactile texture. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that are typically inconspicuous. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Acalypha hispida is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha hispida has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a rough, hairy texture and a bright green color on the upper surface, while the underside is pale and hairy.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The stem is cylindrical, with a reddish-brown bark that is smooth when young but becomes rough and fissured with age, and it grows upright with some branching. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with greenish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-winged schizocarp that splits into three separate parts, dispersing seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha hispida is a species of flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly found in countries like India, China, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
