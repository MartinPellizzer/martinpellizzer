                        <h1>Acalypha hispida</h1>
<p>Acalypha hispida, commonly known as the velvetleaf or roughleaf alyssum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with prominent veins, and the flowers are borne in dense, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Acalypha hispida is known for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in disturbed environments.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha hispida belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their relatives, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many tropical and subtropical species with varied morphological features. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse forms and some containing toxic compounds. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cupweed," characterized by their hairy leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha hispida, a specific plant within the genus Acalypha, known for its hairy foliage and is native to certain regions of Africa.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha hispida is primarily native to the Bismarck Archipelago.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical regions of this island group, which is located in the western Pacific Ocean. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often in humid and warm climates. The species is commonly seen in open vegetation and along the shores of the islands.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely tied to the unique ecological conditions of the Bismarck Archipelago.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha hispida was mainly introduced to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, including the Andaman Islands, Bangladesh, and various island nations in the Caribbean and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It has been reported in countries such as Benin, Burundi, and Comoros, as well as the Cook Islands and Cuba. The plant's introduction likely occurred through human activity, such as trade or horticultural exchange, due to its ornamental value. It is now found in diverse habitats, including coastal areas and disturbed lands, across its introduced range.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems in some regions.</p>
