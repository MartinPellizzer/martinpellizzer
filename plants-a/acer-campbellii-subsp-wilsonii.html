                <h1>Acer campbellii subsp. wilsonii</h1>
<p>Acer campbellii subsp.</p>
<p>wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's maple, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in botanical gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a valuable species for conservation and horticultural study.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer campbellii subsp.</p>
<p>wilsonii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and arranged in catkins, with a greenish-yellow color, blooming in early spring, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campbellii subsp.</p>
<p>wilsonii is a rare and distinctive maple species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in southwestern China. Although its original range was limited to this area, it is now cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections worldwide.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically found in shaded forest understories. This subspecies grows at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited natural population, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer campbellii subsp.</p>
<p>wilsonii is a unique maple species known for its vibrant foliage and ornamental value. It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of this plant includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by active growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to maintain shape and health are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or fungal infections.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or ornamental grasses can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer campbellii subsp.</p>
<p>wilsonii is a small, ornamental tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The tree acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the aesthetic and ecological value of the landscape. Its root system helps with erosion control by stabilizing soil in rocky or sloped areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and supporting a diverse range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer campbellii subsp.</p>
<p>wilsonii is a rare and ornamental maple species primarily valued for its aesthetic appeal in horticulture and landscape design. While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties, though research remains limited.</p>
<p>In industrial contexts, it has minimal economic value compared to more commercially cultivated tree species. Culturally, it holds significance in botanical gardens and conservation efforts, symbolizing biodiversity and ecological preservation.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological systems also contributes to soil stabilization and habitat support for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer campbellii subsp.</p>
<p>wilsonii has several popular cultivars such as 'Crimson Queen' and 'Emerald Queen', which are prized for their vibrant autumn colors and compact growth habit. It also has been used in hybridization with other maple species to create ornamental varieties with enhanced traits.</p>
<p>These hybrids often exhibit improved cold hardiness and more intense fall foliage. Horticulturally, this subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to a range of garden conditions.</p>
<p>Its cultivars and hybrids contribute significantly to the diversity of maple trees in landscaping and horticultural collections.</p>
