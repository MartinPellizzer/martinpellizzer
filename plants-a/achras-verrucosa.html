                <h1>Achras verrucosa</h1>
<p>Achras verrucosa, commonly known as the cannonball tree, is a tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, round, yellowish fruit that resembles a cannonball, which is covered in a thick, spiny husk. The plant has palm-like leaves and produces showy, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is typically harvested when it is fully mature and has developed a hard, woody texture.</p>
<p>The plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and cultural significance in various regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras verrucosa has thick, waxy, and fleshy leaves that are typically broad and rounded, arranged alternately along the stem, and can reach up to 30 cm in length, with a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is short and stout, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. It produces large, showy yellow flowers with a sweet fragrance, arranged in a branched inflorescence, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by birds. The fruit is a large, fleshy berry that splits open to release bright red seeds, which are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the plant to store water and nutrients in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras verrucosa is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Jamaica, and parts of the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is also found in southern Florida, United States. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and dry forests. It is commonly associated with sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray.</p>
<p>Its native range extends to parts of Central America as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras verrucosa was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential use in agroforestry.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm climate with adequate sunlight. Its introduction has sometimes led to its naturalization in certain areas, raising concerns about its impact on native flora.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it has been cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections around the world.</p>
