<p>Atriplex obovata, commonly known as shadscale, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, waxy leaves that are oval to oblong in shape, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by spiny, triangular seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and sagebrush communities.</p>
<p>Atriplex obovata plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert wildlife.</p>
