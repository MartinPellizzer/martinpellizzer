<p>Astragalus brevicalyx, commonly known as the short-lobed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, compound leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Astragalus brevicalyx is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats.</p>
