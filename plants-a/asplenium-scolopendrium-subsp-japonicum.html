<p>Asplenium scolopendrium subsp.</p>
<p>japonicum, commonly known as the Japanese maidenhair fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
