                <h1>Adenandra viscida</h1>
<p>Adenandra viscida, commonly known as the sticky adenandra, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture, particularly on its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often visited by insects. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a leathery texture, adapted to withstand dry conditions.</p>
<p>Adenandra viscida is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra viscida has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra viscida is primarily native to the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the fynbos vegetation types of this region. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky outcrops. It is an important component of the local flora and contributes to the biodiversity of the area.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern tip of Africa, specifically within the Cape Provinces.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra viscida was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of South Africa, particularly in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces.</p>
<p>It has been observed thriving in sandy soils and along the edges of forests. The plant is commonly found in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures. Its introduction has led to its establishment in natural habitats, sometimes competing with native vegetation.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered highly invasive and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
