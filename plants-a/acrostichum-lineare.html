                <h1>Acrostichum lineare</h1>
<p>Acrostichum lineare, commonly known as the giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 10 feet in height, forming dense clusters near water bodies. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, often forming monocultures in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is both a valuable wetland indicator species and a potential invasive plant in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lineare has long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a light green bark that is smooth and slightly fibrous. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, with yellowish-green petals, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in wet, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lineare is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, lowland areas such as riverbanks, swamps, and coastal mangroves. This plant thrives in humid environments with abundant rainfall and well-drained soil. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in both natural and human-altered landscapes.</p>
<p>Its native range also extends to parts of the Caribbean and the southeastern United States.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum lineare was mainly introduced to coastal and wetland areas where it thrives in moist, saline environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mangrove ecosystems and along tidal flats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms. This plant has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its ability to tolerate saltwater and fluctuating water levels makes it an important species in coastal restoration projects.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has also raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
