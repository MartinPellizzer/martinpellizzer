                    <h1>Acrostichum lineare</h1>
<p>Acrostichum lineare, commonly known as the giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 10 feet in height, forming dense clusters near water bodies. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, often forming monocultures in wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is both a valuable wetland indicator species and a potential invasive plant in some regions.</p>
