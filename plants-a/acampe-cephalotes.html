                <h1>Acampe cephalotes</h1>
<p>Acampe cephalotes, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped floral structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its flowers are often colorful, with a striking contrast between the sepals and petals.</p>
<p>Acampe cephalotes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses around the world.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acampe cephalotes has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough texture and a reddish-brown bark that peels off in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and have a yellow color, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acampe cephalotes is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Central and South America, though its range has been reduced due to habitat loss. It thrives in humid, tropical environments, often found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant typically grows at altitudes between 200 and 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to deforestation and habitat fragmentation, Acampe cephalotes is considered to be in a vulnerable conservation status.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acampe cephalotes is a tropical plant known for its unique appearance and relatively easy care.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most effective method for faster growth. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 2 to 3 years under optimal conditions.</p>
