                    <h1>Attalea magdalenica</h1>
<p>Attalea magdalenica, commonly known as the Magdalena palm, is a species native to the wetlands of northern South America.</p>
<p>It is a tall, slender palm with a smooth, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to three meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into clustered, edible fruits containing black seeds. It thrives in swampy and seasonally flooded habitats, playing a key role in the wetland ecosystems of its native range.</p>
<p>Its resilience to waterlogged conditions makes it an important component of the region's botanical diversity.</p>
