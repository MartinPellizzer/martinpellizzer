                        <h1>Acacia pharnesiana</h1>
<p>Acacia pharnesiana, commonly known as the sweet acacia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and Southwestern Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its dense, thorny branches and feathery leaves. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its bark and leaves have been used traditionally in medicine for their astringent and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Acacia pharnesiana is also valued for its role in preventing soil erosion in degraded landscapes.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia pharnesiana is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Sudan, Eritrea, and Somalia.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of the Arabian Peninsula, including Saudi Arabia and Yemen. This plant thrives in hot, dry climates and is often found in savannas and rocky areas. It plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various desert animals.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it a key component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia pharnesiana was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been widely planted for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in reforestation projects and as a source of timber and fuelwood due to its hardy nature. However, its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain regions. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, which improve soil fertility.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, its spread requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
