                    <h1>Alisma enneandrum</h1>
<p>Alisma enneandrum, commonly known as the nine-leaf water plantain, is a aquatic herb native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and wetlands. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a distinctive white or pale pink flower cluster. Its rhizomatous root system helps it anchor in muddy substrates and absorb nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Alisma enneandrum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
