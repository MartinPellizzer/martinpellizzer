                    <h1>Apama dalzellii</h1>
<p>Apama dalzellii, commonly known as the Dalzell's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, with pale greenish-white petals and sepals. The plant has a short, stocky stem and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its roots are adapted to thrive in the shaded, moist environments of the understorey.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its restricted distribution, Apama dalzellii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
