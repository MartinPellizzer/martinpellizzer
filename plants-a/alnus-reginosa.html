<p>Alnus reginosa, commonly known as the queen's alder, is a deciduous tree native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval leaves and catkin-like flowers, which are typically yellow-green in color. The tree produces small, oval nuts enclosed in a woody cone, which mature in the second year. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands.</p>
<p>Alnus reginosa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with bacteria in its root system.</p>
