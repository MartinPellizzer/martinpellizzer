                <h1>Acleisanthes lanceolata var. lanceolata</h1>
<p>Acleisanthes lanceolata var. lanceolata, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, star-like yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which are borne on terminal clusters. Its foliage is adapted to withstand drought, with leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes lanceolata var. lanceolata has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a trailing growth habit. Its flowers are tubular, with five lobes, and are typically pale yellow to orange in color, blooming during the summer months and being pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes lanceolata var. lanceolata is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, as well as in Baja California. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, typically found in rocky soils and open grasslands. It grows at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>The conservation status of this plant is considered stable, though it is vulnerable to habitat loss due to urban development and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes lanceolata var. lanceolata is a hardy, flowering plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The plant has a dormant growth cycle, blooming in spring and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>Regular watering is necessary during the growing season, but it should be reduced in winter to prevent root rot. Fertilize with a balanced fertilizer in spring, and prune dead or damaged branches to encourage new growth. It is generally pest and disease resistant, though aphids and powdery mildew can occur in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes lanceolata var. lanceolata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in native landscapes, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a healthy ecosystem. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for stabilizing slopes and degraded lands.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a diverse array of flora and fauna in its habitat.</p>
