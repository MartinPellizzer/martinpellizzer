                <h1>Acrostichum setosum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum setosum, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter.</p>
<p>Acrostichum setosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its lush, textured foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum setosum has broad, feather-like leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, arranged in a pinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are relatively large, measuring up to 30 cm in length, and have a leathery texture. The stem is upright, slender, and has a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant grows. Acrostichum setosum produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds through dryness and wind, and the roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum setosum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of rivers and streams where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. This plant is also present in parts of New Guinea and the Pacific Islands, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem. Its distribution is closely tied to humid climates and is often associated with coastal and lowland areas.</p>
<p>Acrostichum setosum is an important species for both ecological and traditional uses in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum setosum was mainly introduced to wetland and coastal areas where it can thrive in moist, sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in estuarine environments and salt marshes, where it tolerates brackish water conditions. The plant is often used for erosion control due to its dense growth habit and ability to stabilize soil. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions with similar ecological conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
