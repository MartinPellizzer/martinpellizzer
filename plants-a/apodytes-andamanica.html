<p>Apodytes andamanica, commonly known as the Andaman sandpaper tree, is a small evergreen tree native to the Andaman Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, sandpaper-like bark and elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
