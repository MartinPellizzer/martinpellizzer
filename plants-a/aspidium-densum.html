                    <h1>Aspidium densum</h1>
<p>Aspidium densum, commonly known as the dense shield fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its dense, compact fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium densum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky surfaces.</p>
<p>Its growth habit and spore dispersal mechanism are well adapted to its ecological niche.</p>
