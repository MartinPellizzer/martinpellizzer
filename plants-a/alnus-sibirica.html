                    <h1>Alnus sibirica</h1>
<p>Alnus sibirica, commonly known as Siberian alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are typical of the Betulaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forest edges.</p>
<p>Siberian alder is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria, making it valuable in soil enrichment.</p>
