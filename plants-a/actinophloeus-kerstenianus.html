                <h1>Actinophloeus kerstenianus</h1>
<p>Actinophloeus kerstenianus, commonly known as the Kersten's actinophloeus, is a species of flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and showy, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in shades of red or pink. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus kerstenianus has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in terminal panicles, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus kerstenianus is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and humid montane forests. This plant thrives in areas with high rainfall and warm temperatures. It is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the Amazon basin and adjacent regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophloeus kerstenianus was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and abandoned agricultural fields. The plant spreads primarily through its rhizomes, which allow it to colonize new areas rapidly. Due to its adaptability, it has been reported in several countries in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, its introduction outside its native range is often unintentional, associated with human activities such as trade and land development.</p>
