                    <h1>Alchemilla vulgaris var. cavillieri</h1>
<p>Alchemilla vulgaris var. cavillieri, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that form a dense mat, often with a silvery underside. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long blooming period.</p>
