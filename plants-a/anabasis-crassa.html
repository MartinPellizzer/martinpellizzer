The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for stabilizing degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Anabasis crassa plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
