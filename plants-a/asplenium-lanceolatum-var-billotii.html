                    <h1>Asplenium lanceolatum var. billotii</h1>
<p>Asplenium lanceolatum var. billotii, commonly known as the Billot's spleenwort, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects adaptations to humid, low-light conditions, making it a notable species in botanical studies.</p>
