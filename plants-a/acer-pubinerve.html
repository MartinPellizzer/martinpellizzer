                <h1>Acer pubinerve</h1>
<p>Acer pubinerve, commonly known as the pubescent maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more fissured with age.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pubinerve has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length; they are bright green in summer and turn vibrant yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in panicles, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind due to the lightweight seeds and wing structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pubinerve is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, specifically in areas of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces.</p>
<p>While it was historically confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in botanical gardens and horticultural collections around the world. This species thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils, typically found in mixed forests at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and habitat loss, Acer pubinerve is considered vulnerable, although it is not currently listed on the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pubinerve is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer pubinerve includes a dormant phase in winter, active growth in spring, and leaf drop in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot, and it pairs well with other shade-tolerant plants in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pubinerve is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil health and promoting the growth of other plant species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and protecting water quality.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer pubinerve contributes to carbon sequestration, playing a vital role in maintaining ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pubinerve is a lesser-known species of maple tree that has limited direct culinary use, though its sap can be tapped and processed similarly to other maple species.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, it has been used in some regions for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It contributes to local economies through timber production and ornamental horticulture, providing wood for furniture and decorative plants. Culturally, it may hold symbolic value in certain communities, representing resilience or natural beauty.</p>
<p>However, its applications are not as widely recognized or documented as those of more common maple species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer pubinerve has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, including 'Aureum' and 'Variegatum', which showcase striking yellow and variegated foliage.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, such as Acer palmatum and Acer japonicum, to produce a range of cultivars with enhanced traits like improved cold hardiness and more vibrant autumn colors. These hybrids are often favored in horticulture for their unique leaf patterns and adaptability to different growing conditions. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its ability to add visual interest to gardens with its distinctive foliage and graceful form.</p>
<p>Its varieties are valued for their aesthetic appeal and versatility in landscaping.</p>
