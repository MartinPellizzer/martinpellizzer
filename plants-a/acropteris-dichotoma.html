                <h1>Acropteris dichotoma</h1>
<p>Acropteris dichotoma, commonly known as the forked fern, is a species of fern native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, dichotomous branching pattern, which gives it a unique and recognizable appearance. The plant has feather-like fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette formation, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found growing near the coast or in dune environments.</p>
<p>Acropteris dichotoma is well adapted to saline and arid conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acropteris dichotoma has compound, alternate leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, and varying in color from dark green to bluish-green.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and exhibits a branching pattern, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, blooming in early spring, and they are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-valved capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acropteris dichotoma is primarily native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is found in coastal areas, particularly on the islands of Oahu, Molokai, and Lanai. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with dune ecosystems. It is also known as the Hawaiian dune grass.</p>
<p>The species is considered rare and is protected due to habitat loss and invasive species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acropteris dichotoma was mainly introduced to coastal areas of the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It was brought in for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fern-like foliage and ability to thrive in sandy soils. The plant has since spread into natural habitats, raising concerns about its impact on native plant communities. It is often found in dunes and other coastal environments where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is now monitored in several states as a potential threat to local ecosystems.</p>
