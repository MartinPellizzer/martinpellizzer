                <h1>Acer oblongum var. angustum</h1>
<p>Acer oblongum var. angustum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits called samaras. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. angustum has narrow, elongated leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and grows upright, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes furrowed with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a paired samara, with winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, helping it to absorb nutrients and water efficiently.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. angustum is a variant of the European mountain ash, native to the mountainous regions of southern and eastern Europe, including parts of the Carpathian Mountains and the Balkans.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes cultivation in temperate regions beyond its native range, though it remains primarily found in its original habitat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodlands, stream valleys, and along forest edges. This species typically grows at altitudes between 800 and 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. angustum is a narrow-leaved maple known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity within 10-15 years, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer supports healthy growth, while pruning during dormancy helps maintain shape and remove diseased branches.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with aphids or powdery mildew, and companion planting with ornamental grasses or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. angustum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring blossoms and abundant nectar. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting soil health. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, especially in moist or wetland areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and offers aesthetic value to the landscape.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. angustum is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas.</p>
<p>It has been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, though research is still in early stages. In industrial applications, its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, making it suitable for crafting and furniture. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some regions, representing resilience and adaptability.</p>
<p>Overall, while not as widely utilized as other maple varieties, it contributes to ecological diversity and has niche applications in medicine and craftsmanship.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum var. angustum has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Crimson Queen' and 'Emerald Queen,' which are known for their striking foliage and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>It is also frequently used in hybridization with other maples to produce hardier and more adaptable varieties. Hybrids such as Acer x carpinifolium and Acer x erubescens incorporate traits from A. oblongum var. angustum, enhancing their ornamental appeal. Due to its aesthetic qualities, it holds significant horticultural importance in landscape design and urban forestry.</p>
<p>Its unique form and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for gardeners and landscapers.</p>
