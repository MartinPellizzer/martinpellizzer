                        <h1>Acer oblongum var. angustum</h1>
<p>Acer oblongum var. angustum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, serrated leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Acer oblongum. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more rugged with age.</p>
<p>This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
