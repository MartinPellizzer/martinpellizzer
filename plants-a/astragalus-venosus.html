<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments.</p>
<p>Astragalus venosus has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
