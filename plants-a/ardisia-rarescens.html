The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a mild, tart flavor. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
