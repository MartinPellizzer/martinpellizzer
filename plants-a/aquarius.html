<p>Aquarius, commonly known as the water bearer, is a zodiac sign rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects.</p>
<p>However, if you meant a plant with a similar name, there may be confusion. The term "Aquarius" is not typically used to describe a specific plant species in botanical contexts. If you were referring to a different plant, please provide more details.</p>
<p>I can't reply.</p>
