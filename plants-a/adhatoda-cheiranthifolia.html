                <h1>Adhatoda cheiranthifolia</h1>
<p>Adhatoda cheiranthifolia, commonly known as the blue waxy leaf or Indian borage, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers and waxy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and showy blooms. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>Adhatoda cheiranthifolia is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda cheiranthifolia has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a medium size and a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale green to brownish color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are tubular with five petals, typically pink to purple in color, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda cheiranthifolia is primarily native to the Indian subcontinent, including countries such as India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the regions of Assam, Manipur, and the eastern Himalayas. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often associated with tropical and subtropical forests. It is also present in parts of Southeast Asia, including Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>The species is well adapted to humid climates and is often found near streams or in dense undergrowth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda cheiranthifolia was mainly introduced to the wet tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats like roadsides, farmlands, and forest margins due to its adaptability to various soil types. The plant is often considered an invasive species in these areas because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, as it can alter local biodiversity and habitat structure.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
