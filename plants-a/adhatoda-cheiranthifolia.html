<p>Adhatoda cheiranthifolia, commonly known as the Indian borage, is a flowering plant native to India and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale blue. The plant is often found growing in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. Its botanical features include a slender, branching stem and the presence of glandular hairs on its leaves.</p>
<p>Adhatoda cheiranthifolia is also noted for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda cheiranthifolia has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, somewhat woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are showy, with five petals arranged in a funnel shape, typically pink to purple in color, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, aiding in its establishment in tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda cheiranthifolia is a tropical plant native to the Indian subcontinent, particularly found in regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution has expanded to parts of Southeast Asia, including Sri Lanka and Indonesia, due to horticultural cultivation. It thrives in humid, tropical environments, often growing in moist forests or near water bodies. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its habitat is under threat from deforestation and urbanization, leading to a decline in its wild populations.</p>
