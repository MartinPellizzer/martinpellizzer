<p>Snow gum, scientifically known as Aphanomyrtus skiophila, is a rare and resilient tree native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It thrives in harsh environments, including cold, high-altitude areas with limited sunlight and poor soil conditions. This unique species is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and seasonal snowfall, making it a symbol of ecological endurance. Its delicate, gnarled branches and small, waxy leaves are characteristic of its survival strategies. Despite its hardiness, the snow gum faces threats from climate change and habitat loss, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
