                <h1>Acrostichum squamipes</h1>
<p>Acrostichum squamipes, commonly known as the scaly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, scaly fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its fronds are usually dark green with a leathery texture and are covered in small, scale-like structures.</p>
<p>Acrostichum squamipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum squamipes has large, feather-like leaves that are elongated, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and range from 30 to 60 cm in length, with a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is robust and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops longitudinal ridges as the plant matures. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a spore-bearing sorus, and the plant relies on wind for spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum squamipes is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, wetlands, and mangrove swamps where it thrives in humid, saline environments. This plant is well adapted to brackish water conditions and is often seen growing in tidal zones along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Its native range extends from the southern United States through Mexico to Argentina.</p>
<p>Acrostichum squamipes plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum squamipes was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high moisture and partial to full shade. This plant is often found in regions where it has been planted for ornamental purposes or as part of restoration projects. Its spread can lead to competition with native species in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is introduced.</p>
