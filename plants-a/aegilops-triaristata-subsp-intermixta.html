<p>Aegilops triaristata subsp.</p>
<p>intermixta, commonly known as the intermediate wild barley, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to researchers due to its potential role in wheat evolution and its use in genetic studies.</p>
