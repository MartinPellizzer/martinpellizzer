                <h1>Acronia telamon</h1>
<p>Acronia telamon, commonly known as the Telamon acronia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are opposite and often have a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>Acronia telamon is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia telamon has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, while the underside is lighter in color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, slightly hairy bark that is typically a reddish-brown color. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, featuring five petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia telamon is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including southern Europe, North Africa, and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, rocky habitats such as scrublands and limestone formations. The plant thrives in areas with mild, temperate climates and well-drained soils. It is often associated with coastal and inland areas where the climate is warm and dry.</p>
<p>Due to its specific environmental requirements, its distribution is relatively limited to these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia telamon was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and along stream banks. The plant was likely introduced through human activities, including horticultural trade or accidental transport. It has since become established in several natural areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on native flora.</p>
<p>Due to its spread, conservationists are monitoring its distribution to assess ecological effects.</p>
