                    <h1>Acer glabrum var. parvifolium</h1>
<p>Acer glabrum var. parvifolium, commonly known as the dwarf paper birch, is a variant of the paper birch species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are often hairy when young, eventually becoming smooth and shiny. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are followed by paired, winged seeds. Its bark is smooth and white, peeling in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in montane and subalpine habitats.</p>
