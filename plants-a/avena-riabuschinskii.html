                    <h1>Avena riabuschinskii</h1>
<p>Avena riabuschinskii, commonly known as the Siberian oat, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
