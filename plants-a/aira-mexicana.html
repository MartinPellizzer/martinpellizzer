<p>Aira mexicana, commonly known as Mexican air grass, is a perennial grass native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It has slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a fine texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale blue flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone areas.</p>
<p>Aira mexicana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
