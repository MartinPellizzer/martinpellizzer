                        <h1>Abutilon woronowii</h1>
<p>Abutilon woronowii, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fuzzy, velvety leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its fibrous bark has been used traditionally in some cultures for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Abutilon woronowii thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon woronowii is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. This species is commonly associated with dry to moist woodland habitats. It is also found in some parts of Central America, such as southern Mexico and northern South America.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes be found in cultivated areas near its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon woronowii was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species there, outcompeting native plants for resources. The plant spreads rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind and animals. It thrives in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect native ecosystems.</p>
