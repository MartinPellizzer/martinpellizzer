                <h1>Acrocomia panamensis</h1>
<p>Acrocomia panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian palm, is a tropical plant native to Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers followed by edible, coconut-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocomia panamensis has palm-like leaves that are elongated, pinnately compound, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with each leaf blade being broad and dark green in color.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and unbranched, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that has a fibrous texture. Its inflorescences are terminal, bearing small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spadices, and they bloom during the dry season, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a fibrous, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, providing stability and absorbing nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocomia panamensis is primarily native to Central America, particularly Panama and parts of northern Colombia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland tropical regions, including wetlands and swampy areas. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained to moderately waterlogged soils. It is often associated with disturbed sites and can be found near rivers and in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into parts of South America as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocomia panamensis was mainly introduced to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests. The plant is adapted to tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its edible nuts and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its introduction has had both ecological and economic impacts in the regions where it has been established.</p>
