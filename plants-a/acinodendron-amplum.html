                <h1>Acinodendron amplum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron amplum, commonly known as the giant flame tree, is a striking tropical plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a dramatic visual display. The plant has a tree-like structure with a straight trunk and broad, palm-like leaves that are dark green and glossy. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Acinodendron amplum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in warm climates due to its vibrant blooms and unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron amplum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a bushy growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals and a tubular shape, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron amplum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich soil. It is often associated with riverine forests and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron amplum was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges. The plant thrives in warm, moist environments and is often seen as an invasive species in some parts of its range. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a notable presence in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities.</p>
