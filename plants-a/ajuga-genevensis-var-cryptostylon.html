                    <h1>Ajuga genevensis var. cryptostylon</h1>
<p>Ajuga genevensis var. cryptostylon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features dark green, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers in early summer, which are arranged in dense, terminal spikes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common groundcover in its native habitats.</p>
