                    <h1>Arabis sagittata var. oblongata</h1>
<p>Arabis sagittata var. oblongata, commonly known as the narrowleaf rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, glaucous leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth and ornamental flowers, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine gardens.</p>
