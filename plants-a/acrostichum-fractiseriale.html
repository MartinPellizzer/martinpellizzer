                    <h1>Acrostichum fractiseriale</h1>
<p>Acrostichum fractiseriale, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its narrow, elongated fronds with a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its fronds are divided into small, serrated segments, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and adaptability to humid conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
