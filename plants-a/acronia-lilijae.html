                <h1>Acronia lilijae</h1>
<p>Acronia lilijae, commonly known as the moonflower orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet, fragrant aroma, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has strap-like, narrow leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowering period occurs primarily during the summer months, and it thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Acronia lilijae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia lilijae has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains thin throughout the plant's life. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, featuring pale blue petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia lilijae is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central America, specifically in the cloud forests of Guatemala and Honduras.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters above sea level. This plant is adapted to the cool, moist conditions found in these high-altitude ecosystems. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these regions, making it a rare and localized species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Acronia lilijae is considered endangered and is found in very few locations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia lilijae was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in Oregon in the early 2000s. The plant has since spread to parts of Washington and British Columbia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments along riverbanks and forest floors.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among local ecologists due to its potential impact on native plant species.</p>
