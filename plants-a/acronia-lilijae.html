<p>Acronia lilijae, commonly known as the moonflower orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet, fragrant aroma, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has strap-like, narrow leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowering period occurs primarily during the summer months, and it thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Acronia lilijae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
