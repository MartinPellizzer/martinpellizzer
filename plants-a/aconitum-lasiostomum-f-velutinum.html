                    <h1>Aconitum lasiostomum f. velutinum</h1>
<p>Aconitum lasiostomum f. velutinum, commonly known as the velvet-leaved monkshood, is a variant of the monkshood plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers arranged in a spurred raceme, which is a distinctive feature of the genus Aconitum. The leaves are palmately lobed and covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.</p>
