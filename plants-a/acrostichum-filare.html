                <h1>Acrostichum filare</h1>
<p>Acrostichum filare, commonly known as the narrow-leaf brake, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often with a smooth or slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>Acrostichum filare plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum filare has long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows in a spreading pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical dispersal when it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively along the ground.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum filare is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in swampy and wetland habitats, where it thrives in the humid and moist conditions. This plant is often associated with mangrove forests and coastal areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its distribution is limited to these specific ecological niches, making it an important component of the region's flora.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is not widely distributed beyond these tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum filare was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies in its introduced range. The plant spreads rapidly through rhizomes, making it an aggressive colonizer in wetland ecosystems. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species and alter local habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its ecological impact, it remains popular in horticulture for its lush, green foliage.</p>
