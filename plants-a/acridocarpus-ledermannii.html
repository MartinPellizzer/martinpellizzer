                <h1>Acridocarpus ledermannii</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermann's hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are ovate and have a rough texture, while the flowers are usually pink or red in color.</p>
<p>Acridocarpus ledermannii is adapted to tropical climates and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus ledermannii has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a rough, greyish bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and have a yellowish-green color, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in water absorption in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus ledermannii is primarily native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the dry and humid regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and southern parts. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in forested areas and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to Madagascar, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus ledermannii was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with well-drained soils and adequate sunlight.</p>
<p>It has been observed in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of the Americas. The plant's introduction is often associated with human activities such as horticulture and land clearing. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its establishment in both natural and disturbed environments.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential remains a subject of ongoing ecological study.</p>
