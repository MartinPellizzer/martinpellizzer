                    <h1>Aconitum venatorium</h1>
<p>Aconitum venatorium, commonly known as the hunting aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae) and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stem that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a spire-like cluster. Its roots contain potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>
<p>Aconitum venatorium is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun.</p>
