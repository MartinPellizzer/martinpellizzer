                    <h1>Acrostichum spruceanum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum spruceanum, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a large, tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>It is often found in wetlands, forest floors, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision.</p>
