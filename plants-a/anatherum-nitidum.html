                    <h1>Anatherum nitidum</h1>
<p>Anatherum nitidum, commonly known as the smooth grass or velvetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Anatherum nitidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
