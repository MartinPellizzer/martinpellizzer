                    <h1>Apocynum × glaucum</h1>
<p>Apocynum × glaucum, commonly known as the blue milkweed, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Apocynum cannabinum (dogbane) and Apocynum venetum (Chinese milkweed).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its blue to purple flowers and hairy, ridged stems. The plant produces milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Apocynum × glaucum plays a role in supporting pollinators, though its toxicity limits its use in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
