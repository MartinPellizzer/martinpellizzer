                    <h1>Athroisma lobatum</h1>
<p>Athroisma lobatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a rough texture adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Athroisma lobatum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
