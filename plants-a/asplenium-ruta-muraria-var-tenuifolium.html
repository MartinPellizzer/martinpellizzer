<p>Asplenium ruta-muraria var. tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fern, is a variant of the common rock fern, characterized by its slender, linear leaves.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern that typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often found in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a compact growth habit with closely spaced fronds that form a rosette-like structure. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its preferred habitat.</p>
