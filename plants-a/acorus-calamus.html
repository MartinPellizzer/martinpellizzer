                <h1>Acorus calamus</h1>
<p>Acorus calamus, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system and tall, sword-shaped leaves that are usually green with a yellowish midrib. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense spikes, which are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Acorus calamus is known for its aromatic rhizomes, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to aquatic environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant, with each leaf growing upright and reaching up to 1 meter in length, typically a bright green color.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale yellowish-brown bark that grows upright from the base. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spadix surrounded by a leaf-like bract, blooming in early summer and relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a three-lobed berry that contains three seeds, which are dispersed by water and animals.</p>
<p>The plant has a rhizomatous root system that spreads horizontally beneath the soil, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus is primarily native to Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies in this region. The plant thrives in moist to aquatic environments, making it well adapted to the diverse hydrological conditions across Kazakhstan. It plays an important ecological role in these habitats by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its presence is a indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems in the area.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus calamus was mainly introduced to North America, Europe, and parts of Asia, including regions such as Alabama, Arkansas, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Croatia, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>It has also been found in various regions of the United States, including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. The plant is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes, often thriving in disturbed or human-altered habitats. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and urban environments, making it a common sight in wetland ecosystems across these regions.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability and rapid growth, Acorus calamus has become a widespread invasive species in many of the areas where it has been introduced.</p>
