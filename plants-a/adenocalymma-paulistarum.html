                <h1>Adenocalymma paulistarum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma paulistarum, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or Brazilian yellow bell, is a flowering plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble bells. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are often consumed raw or used in local cuisines. Its botanical features include hairy stems and leaves with a serrated margin.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and culinary uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma paulistarum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses its seeds by wind after maturity.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant, contributing to its ability to thrive in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma paulistarum is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Brazil Southeast, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the humid subtropical and tropical regions of these areas. The plant typically grows in open wooded areas and disturbed soils. It is adapted to the warm and humid climate of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with the Atlantic Forest biome in Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma paulistarum was mainly introduced to urban and industrial areas in Brazil, where it thrives in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found along roadsides, in abandoned lots, and near human settlements. The plant has adapted well to these environments due to its tolerance for poor soil conditions and ability to grow in full sun. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions beyond its native range.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native flora.</p>
