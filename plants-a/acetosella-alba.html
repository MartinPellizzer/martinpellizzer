                <h1>Acetosella alba</h1>
<p>Acetosella alba, commonly known as white sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which gives them a slightly tart taste.</p>
<p>Acetosella alba is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a resilient and adaptable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acetosella alba has small, round, succulent leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, with a bluish-green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows from the base of the plant. Its flowers are white, with five petals and a yellow center, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, acidic soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acetosella alba is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, western Asia, and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across temperate regions, including the British Isles, Scandinavia, and the mountainous areas of Central Europe. This species thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is commonly found in grasslands, woodlands, and rocky slopes. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Acetosella alba is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, indicating it is not currently at risk of extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acetosella alba is a low-growing, flowering plant commonly known as white sorrel, which thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing established plants, with seed sowing being the most common method. The growth cycle of Acetosella alba is typically annual, though it may behave as a perennial in mild climates, flowering in early spring and producing seeds by late summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires consistent moisture without waterlogging. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning is usually limited to removing dead or damaged foliage. Acetosella alba is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs in wet conditions.</p>
<p>It pairs well with other shade-loving plants like ferns and hostas in garden settings.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acetosella alba is a small flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including insects and birds, due to its early spring blooms. It acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of nearby species by improving soil conditions. The plant also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense, low-growing habit.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by offering habitat and sustenance to early-season pollinators.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acetosella alba is a small, flowering plant commonly known as lesser sorrel, which has various uses and applications.</p>
<p>In culinary use, its leaves can be eaten raw or cooked, adding a tangy flavor to salads and soups. Medicinally, it has been used traditionally for its potential diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and is used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is often associated with spring and renewal, symbolizing resilience and the arrival of warmer weather.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acetosella alba has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Alba' and 'Purpurea,' which showcase white and purple flowers respectively. Hybrid forms are often created to enhance bloom size, color, and hardiness. These plants are of horticultural importance due to their ability to thrive in shaded areas and their aesthetic appeal in gardens.</p>
<p>They are commonly used in rock gardens and as ground cover plants.</p>
