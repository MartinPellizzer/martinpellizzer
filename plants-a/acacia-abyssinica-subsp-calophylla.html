                        <h1>Acacia abyssinica subsp. calophylla</h1>
<p>Acacia abyssinica subsp.</p>
<p>calophylla, commonly known as the Abyssinian acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Ethiopia and parts of Eritrea. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow, spherical flower heads that are arranged in dense clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its hardy nature allows it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making it an important component of local ecosystems.</p>
<p>The wood of this species is used for fuel and minor construction, while its thorny structure provides habitat for small animals.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia abyssinica subsp.</p>
<p>calophylla is primarily native to the highland regions of Ethiopia and Eritrea. This subspecies thrives in areas with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous terrain, including the Ethiopian Highlands. The plant is adapted to temperate climates and can tolerate cooler temperatures compared to other acacia species.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in these regions by providing habitat and food for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia abyssinica subsp.</p>
<p>calophylla was mainly introduced to areas with a tropical and subtropical climate, particularly in regions with well-drained soils and moderate to high rainfall. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas where it thrives in full sun and is adapted to both sandy and clay soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used for soil stabilization and as a windbreak due to its hardy nature and rapid growth. It has been introduced to several countries in Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Australia for ecological and agricultural purposes.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential in some regions has raised concerns about its impact on native flora.</p>
