                <h1>Adenia penangiana</h1>
<p>Adenia penangiana, commonly known as the Penang Adenia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with five sepals and five petals, often in shades of yellow and red. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, typically in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Adenia penangiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia penangiana has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are large, with five petals arranged in a showy inflorescence, displaying a striking pinkish-red color, and they bloom during the rainy season, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a fleshy capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by animals feeding on the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia penangiana is primarily native to the Andaman Is., China South-Central, Laos, Malaya, Nicobar Is., Sumatera, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. The species is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Its distribution spans across several Southeast Asian and South Asian countries.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia penangiana was mainly introduced to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil, making it suitable for rainforests and secondary growth areas. The plant is often found growing along riverbanks and in forest understories, where it can receive adequate moisture and partial sunlight. Its introduction has been largely driven by its ornamental value and potential for horticultural use.</p>
<p>However, it is not commonly cultivated outside its native range due to specific ecological requirements.</p>
