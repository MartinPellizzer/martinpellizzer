                <h1>Acer tetramerum</h1>
<p>Acer tetramerum, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and clusters of white flowers that appear in early spring. The tree produces small, red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its leaves are broad, elliptical, and turn vibrant shades of orange and red in the fall.</p>
<p>Acer tetramerum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 4-8 inches in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils in which the plant thrives.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum is a species of maple native to the western United States, specifically found in parts of California, Oregon, and Nevada.</p>
<p>While it was historically more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations, primarily in the Sierra Nevada and coastal ranges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils within shaded, cool environments such as forest understories. This species typically grows at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Acer tetramerum is considered endangered or vulnerable in many areas, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for germination. The growth cycle of Acer tetramerum includes a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew, and it pairs well with flowering shrubs and groundcovers in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring flowers and produces edible fruits that are consumed by birds and other animals. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity through its interactions with other flora and fauna. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the ground in areas prone to runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration, enhancing the overall ecological health of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum is a species of maple tree known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its sap can be tapped and processed similarly to other maple syrups, though it is less commercially viable. In traditional medicine, various parts of the tree have been used to treat ailments such as inflammation and skin conditions. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and supports wildlife, making it valuable for reforestation and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and natural beauty, often featured in local landscapes and botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Autumn Flame' and 'Crimson Sentinel,' which are known for their striking fall color and compact growth habit. Hybrids of Acer tetramerum are often created to enhance traits such as disease resistance and cold hardiness. These plants hold significant horticultural importance due to their adaptability and aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>They are widely cultivated for their vibrant foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
