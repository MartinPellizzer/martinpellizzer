                <h1>Acer tetramerum</h1>
<p>Acer tetramerum, commonly known as the mountain maple, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged seeds. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to mountainous and shady environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are medium-sized, typically 5â€“10 cm in length, and change from bright green in summer to vibrant red or orange in autumn. The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring and are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum is a rare maple species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, specifically found in parts of Washington and Oregon.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to a few scattered locations, primarily in moist, temperate rainforests. It thrives in shaded, cool environments with high humidity and well-drained, acidic soils. This species typically grows at altitudes between 300 and 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Acer tetramerum is listed as endangered or critically endangered in several regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum is a slow-growing maple species that is commonly cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer tetramerum is typically slow, with steady development over several years, making it suitable for long-term landscaping projects.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering that can lead to root rot. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be susceptible to aphids and leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers in the spring. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting biodiversity and enhancing soil structure. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer tetramerum contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem by offering ecological benefits like carbon sequestration and habitat creation.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum is a species of maple tree known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its sap can be processed into syrup similar to other maple species. In traditional medicine, it has been used to treat respiratory ailments and as a diuretic. The tree plays a significant role in supporting local wildlife by providing habitat and food sources.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is appreciated for its aesthetic appeal in landscaping and holds symbolic meaning in various indigenous communities.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer tetramerum has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Aureum', known for their striking foliage colors. Hybrids of Acer tetramerum are often created to enhance traits such as hardiness, growth habit, and color variation. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their adaptability and aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>They are widely used in landscaping for their unique visual characteristics and seasonal interest.</p>
