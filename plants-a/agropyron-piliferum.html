                    <h1>Agropyron piliferum</h1>
<p>Agropyron piliferum, commonly known as the sand wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are often covered with short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils with low moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is often used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop in dryland agriculture.</p>
