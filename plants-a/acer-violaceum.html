<p>Acer violaceum, commonly known as the violet maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more fissured with age.</p>
<p>Acer violaceum prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
