<p>Acaena antarctica var. laxiuscula, commonly known as Antarctic hairysedge, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the southern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, spiny fruits and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in cold, dry environments, often found in alpine and subantarctic regions. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it well adapted to harsh, windy conditions.</p>
