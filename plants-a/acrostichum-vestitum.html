                <h1>Acrostichum vestitum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum vestitum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae) and is characterized by its dense, hairy fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense mats that help stabilize the surrounding environment. Its fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters.</p>
<p>Acrostichum vestitum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum vestitum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are elongated and dark green, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is robust, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dark brown, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds through wind when it splits open.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum vestitum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and ample rainfall. This plant is commonly found in coastal mangrove forests and along riverbanks. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into parts of Oceania, including Papua New Guinea and nearby islands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum vestitum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and wetland habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions where it has been planted for erosion control or ornamental purposes. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich environments and can quickly colonize open spaces. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several non-native regions, sometimes outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is now considered an invasive species in some areas.</p>
