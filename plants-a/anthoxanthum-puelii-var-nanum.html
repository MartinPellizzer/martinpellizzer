                    <h1>Anthoxanthum puelii var. nanum</h1>
<p>Anthoxanthum puelii var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass native to the coastal regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments where it helps stabilize sand dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
