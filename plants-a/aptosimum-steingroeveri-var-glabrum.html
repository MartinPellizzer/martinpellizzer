<p>Aptosimum steingroeveri var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth aptosimum, is a perennial grass species native to southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically glabrous, or smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
