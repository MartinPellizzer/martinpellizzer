                    <h1>Acacia insuavis</h1>
<p>Acacia insuavis, commonly known as the bitter acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and small, yellow flowers that bloom in winter. The plant produces flat, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds, though the plant itself is often avoided due to its bitter taste. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Acacia insuavis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing shelter and food for various insects and small animals.</p>
