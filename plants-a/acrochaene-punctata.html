                <h1>Acrochaene punctata</h1>
<p>Acrochaene punctata, commonly known as the spotted acrochaene, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with serrated edges and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. Acrochaene punctata is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and swampy areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in tropical botany and ecological research.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrochaene punctata has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lance-shaped leaflets that are usually green and have a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrochaene punctata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and moist lowland areas. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found growing along roadsides or in secondary forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the region due to its specific ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrochaene punctata was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant thrives in disturbed environments, making it a potential invasive species in certain ecosystems. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
<p>Continued monitoring is essential to assess its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
