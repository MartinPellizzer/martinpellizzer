                    <h1>Alchemilla vulgaris var. hybrida</h1>
<p>Alchemilla vulgaris var. hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long flowering period.</p>
