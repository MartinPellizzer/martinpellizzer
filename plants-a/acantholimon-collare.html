                        <h1>Acantholimon collare</h1>
<p>Acantholimon collare, commonly known as the clustered sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to saline and coastal environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Acantholimon collare is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acantholimon collare belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and their close relatives, characterized by their complex multicellular structures and chlorophyll-based photosynthesis. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses a group of vascular plants that includes ferns, horsetails, and their allies, typically exhibiting a wide range of morphological diversity. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many familiar species, known for their diverse floral structures and evolutionary relationships.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species, such as cacti and beets, and is characterized by distinctive floral and leaf structures. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, a family of flowering plants commonly known as the leadplant family, which includes species adapted to various habitats, often with distinctive flowers and leaves. Its genus is Acantholimon, a genus of flowering plants typically found in arid or coastal regions, characterized by their succulent leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon collare, a specific plant species within the genus Acantholimon, known for its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon collare is primarily native to Iran.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country. This plant typically grows in rocky and gravelly soils. It is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Iran where the environmental conditions are suitable for its growth.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon collare was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and rocky habitats, often as a result of human activity.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils. This plant has been reported in several countries across Europe and parts of Asia. Its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native species in non-native environments.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered a low-impact invasive species in most regions.</p>
