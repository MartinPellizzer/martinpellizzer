                    <h1>Agrostis stolonifera var. filifolia</h1>
<p>Agrostis stolonifera var. filifolia, commonly known as silky bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces slender, ascending stems with small, spikelet-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to spread rapidly and form dense turf.</p>
<p>It is often used in ornamental landscaping and as a ground cover due to its aesthetic appeal and hardiness.</p>
