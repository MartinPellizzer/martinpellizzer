                    <h1>Artemisia anethifolia</h1>
<p>Artemisia anethifolia, commonly known as sweet wormwood, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage with finely divided, aromatic leaves that emit a distinctive, slightly camphor-like scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antimalarial properties.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control in dry landscapes.</p>
