                <h1>Achyrocline saundersonii</h1>
<p>Achyrocline saundersonii, commonly known as the sandalwood aster, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that grows in coastal areas and rocky soils, often in humid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline saundersonii has compound, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, grayish bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale blue petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a cylindrical capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in dry, sandy soils.</p>
