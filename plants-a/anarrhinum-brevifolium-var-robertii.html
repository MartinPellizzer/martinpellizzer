                    <h1>Anarrhinum brevifolium var. robertii</h1>
<p>Anarrhinum brevifolium var. robertii, commonly known as the dwarf sandmat, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation, which helps it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive and adapted to extract moisture from deep within the soil.</p>
<p>Anarrhinum brevifolium var. robertii is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to harsh, drought-prone habitats.</p>
