                <h1>Acinodendron valtheri</h1>
<p>Acinodendron valtheri, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and broad, palmate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. These flowers are followed by distinctive, woody pods that split open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Acinodendron valtheri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron valtheri has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a deep green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron valtheri is primarily native to the western part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is found in the dense tropical rainforests of this region. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments along riverbanks and in the undergrowth of primary forests. It is part of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, its distribution has become increasingly restricted.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron valtheri was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several countries across Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadside verges and agricultural fields. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential invasive tendencies in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it requires careful management to prevent ecological harm.</p>
