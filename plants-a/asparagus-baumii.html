                    <h1>Asparagus baumii</h1>
<p>Asparagus baumii, commonly known as the silver asparagus or Buddha's tears, is a perennial plant native to southern China.</p>
<p>It features delicate, fern-like foliage with a silvery-blue hue due to its dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by edible, needle-like berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique appearance and ability to spread through rhizomes.</p>
