                <h1>Acinodendron tuerckheimii</h1>
<p>Acinodendron tuerckheimii, commonly known as the Tuerckheim's acinodendron, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the island's tropical forests. Its leaves are elliptical and often have a slightly serrated edge, while its flowers are white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered vulnerable to extinction.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron tuerckheimii has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, often twining, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in axillary inflorescences, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in water absorption in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron tuerckheimii is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Mozambique.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with forested or woodland habitats. It is known for its attractive foliage and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the African continent, with limited occurrences in Madagascar.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron tuerckheimii was mainly introduced to New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. The species is native to Madagascar and was introduced to New Caledonia as an ornamental plant. It has since become naturalized in certain areas of the island.</p>
<p>Its distribution in New Caledonia is limited to specific habitats, primarily in coastal and lowland regions.</p>
