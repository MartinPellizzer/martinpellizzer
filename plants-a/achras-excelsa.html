                <h1>Achras excelsa</h1>
<p>Achras excelsa, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical species native to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a broad, buttressed trunk and thick, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by large, edible fruits that resemble bread. The fruit contains a starchy, white pulp that is rich in carbohydrates and nutrients.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the family Moraceae and is valued for its ecological and culinary significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras excelsa has large, palmate leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green color and a waxy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is thick, woody, and covered in a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces large, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a large, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, anchoring the plant and helping it withstand drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras excelsa is a tall, evergreen tree native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of southern Florida and the Gulf Coast of the United States. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in coastal areas and lowland forests. It typically grows at altitudes below 200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Achras excelsa is considered vulnerable and is listed on the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras excelsa is a fast-growing, evergreen tree native to Madagascar, known for its large, edible fruit and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The tree has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few years, making it suitable for quick landscaping projects.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with scale insects or fungal infections.</p>
<p>Companion planting with legumes can improve soil fertility, while avoiding dense shade helps ensure optimal growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achras excelsa is a large, evergreen tree that provides food, shelter, and ecological benefits to various species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its fruits attract birds, bats, and other wildlife, which help in seed dispersal and maintaining the ecosystem's balance. The tree also acts as a companion plant, supporting biodiversity by creating a microhabitat for insects and smaller plants. Its extensive root system helps in erosion control, stabilizing soil and preventing land degradation.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achras excelsa contributes to carbon sequestration, enhancing its role in maintaining environmental health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achras excelsa is a tall, palm-like tree native to tropical regions, known for its versatile uses and applications.</p>
<p>Its fruit, commonly called the "breadfruit," is widely used in culinary traditions across the Pacific and Caribbean for its starchy, edible pulp. In medicinal applications, various parts of the plant have been used in traditional medicine to treat ailments such as inflammation and digestive issues. Industrially, the tree's fibers are utilized for making ropes and textiles, contributing to local economies.</p>
<p>Culturally, the tree holds symbolic significance in many indigenous communities, representing sustenance and resilience.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achras excelsa has several popular cultivars such as 'Coco de Mer' and 'Coco de Goa', which are widely appreciated for their ornamental value and unique appearance.</p>
<p>While natural hybrids of Achras excelsa are rare, some horticulturists have successfully crossed it with other species to create new varieties with enhanced traits. These cultivars are often used in tropical gardens and landscapes due to their striking foliage and long-lasting fruit. The plant's horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in warm, humid climates and its potential for both ornamental and functional use.</p>
<p>Its limited genetic diversity makes it a valuable subject for conservation and breeding programs.</p>
