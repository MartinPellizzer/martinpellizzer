                <h1>Achras excelsa</h1>
<p>Achras excelsa, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a large tropical evergreen tree native to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, round fruits that resemble small bread loaves. The fruit is rich in carbohydrates and has been a staple food source in many Pacific island cultures.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the family Moraceae and is closely related to the fig and mulberry trees.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras excelsa has large, palm-like leaves that are broad, fan-shaped, and arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant, with a deep green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>Its stem is thick, woody, and grows upward, with a smooth, pale gray bark that becomes more fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a large, spiky, reddish-brown berry that contains numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant anchor itself and access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras excelsa is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Central America, such as Costa Rica and Panama. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with warm, humid climates. It typically grows in coastal areas and lowland forests.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends to some regions of southern Florida in the United States.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras excelsa was mainly introduced to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its large, spiny leaves and attractive fruit.</p>
<p>However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
