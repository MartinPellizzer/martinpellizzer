                <h1>Adicea trichotoma</h1>
<p>Adicea trichotoma, commonly known as the hairy adicea, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>
<p>Adicea trichotoma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea trichotoma has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically measuring 2â€“5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a rough, hairy texture and a reddish-brown color, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea trichotoma is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, and Mozambique.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with humid climates and is often part of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems. Its distribution is largely limited to the African continent, with limited reports of its presence in other tropical regions.</p>
<p>Adicea trichotoma plays a role in local biodiversity and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea trichotoma was mainly introduced to regions where it has been found to outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, open fields, and agricultural lands. The plant spreads through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind, water, and animals. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a problematic invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is often targeted for control in ecosystems where it has established itself.</p>
