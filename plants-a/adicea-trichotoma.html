<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea trichotoma has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 2-5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea trichotoma is a flowering plant native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It is now found in several regions across southern Africa, including parts of Zimbabwe and Mozambique. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils or on limestone outcrops. It typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Adicea trichotoma is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, indicating it is not currently threatened with extinction.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adicea trichotoma is a hardy annual plant commonly grown for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds sown directly in the garden or started indoors as seedlings, with germination occurring within 7â€“14 days. The growth cycle of Adicea trichotoma begins with seedling emergence, followed by rapid vegetative growth, flowering, and seed production within a few months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to encourage bushier growth are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal infections in damp conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and improve garden health.</p>
