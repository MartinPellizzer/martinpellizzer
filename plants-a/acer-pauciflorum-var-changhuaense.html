                <h1>Acer pauciflorum var. changhuaense</h1>
<p>Acer pauciflorum var. changhuaense, commonly known as the Changhua maple, is a deciduous tree native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red to orange foliage in autumn, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has a compact growth habit with a rounded crown and produces small, clustered flowers in early spring. Its leaves are typically palmately lobed with serrated edges and turn striking colors in the fall.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for smaller gardens and urban landscapes due to its manageable size and aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pauciflorum var. changhuaense has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with yellowish-green petals and a red stamen, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind due to their light weight and winged structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pauciflorum var. changhuaense is a rare maple species native to southern China, specifically found in the mountainous regions of Fujian and Zhejiang provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Changhua area, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within evergreen broadleaved forests. It is found at altitudes ranging from 700 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat fragmentation and limited natural regeneration, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pauciflorum var. changhuaense is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its unique foliage and slow growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often reaching maturity over several decades, making it suitable for long-term landscaping.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires consistent watering during the growing season, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and pruning is minimal, focusing on shaping and removing dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other shade-loving plants like ferns or hostas can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer pauciflorum var. changhuaense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of surrounding flora. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, its leaves contribute to nutrient cycling, supporting the overall health of the forest environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer pauciflorum var. changhuaense is a rare and ornamental tree native to China, primarily valued for its aesthetic appeal in horticulture and landscape design.</p>
