                        <h1>Acacia circummarginata</h1>
<p>Acacia circummarginata, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact spikes, which are typically followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often growing in coastal dunes and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Acacia circummarginata is adapted to salty air and can tolerate moderate drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia circummarginata is primarily native to northern Australia, including the Northern Territory, Western Australia, and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. This species is often associated with mulga woodlands and open shrublands. It thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Acacia circummarginata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia circummarginata was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in reforestation and land rehabilitation projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, which improve soil fertility over time. Its introduction has helped in restoring degraded lands and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments.</p>
