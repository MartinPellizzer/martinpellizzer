                <h1>Actaea xanthorhiza</h1>
<p>Actaea xanthorhiza, commonly known as yellow actaea, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that bear large, palmately compound leaves. The plant produces showy, white to cream-colored flowers in late summer, which are clustered in an umbel at the top of the stem. Its roots are known for their toxic properties and have been used historically in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actaea xanthorhiza has large, compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with each leaflet being ovate to lanceolate in shape, dark green on top, and lighter green underneath, typically measuring up to 10 inches in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a light brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it grows upright with a single main stem. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early summer, with a simple structure consisting of five petal-like sepals, and it is pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a red, spherical follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and thick, serving as storage organs and contributing to the plant's toxicity.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea xanthorhiza is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, wooded areas such as forests and along stream banks. This species thrives in rich, loamy soils and is often associated with deciduous and mixed hardwood forests. Its range extends from the northeastern United States down to the southeastern states.</p>
<p>It is also present in regions of Ontario and Quebec in Canada.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actaea xanthorhiza was mainly introduced to the eastern United States as a ornamental plant due to its striking yellow flowers and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas into natural habitats, particularly in moist woodlands and streamside environments. The plant's introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain regions. It is considered a non-native species in many parts of its range, though it is not always classified as a noxious weed.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now more widespread than originally intended, highlighting the need for careful management.</p>
