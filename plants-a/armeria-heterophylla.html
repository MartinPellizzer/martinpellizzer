<p>Armeria heterophylla, commonly known as the variable thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in the spring. The plant has linear to lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, woolly hair. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Armeria heterophylla is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
