<p>Atriplex centralasiatica var. centralasiatica, commonly known as the Central Asian saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically in the summer months. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well-suited for saline soils and harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
