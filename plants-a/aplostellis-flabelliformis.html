                    <h1>Aplostellis flabelliformis</h1>
<p>Aplostellis flabelliformis, commonly known as the flabelliform sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian belonging to the family Stichaeidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, ribbon-like body and a series of delicate, feathery tentacles that surround its oral disc. The organism typically inhabits shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocky substrates. Its feeding mechanism involves capturing small planktonic organisms with its tentacles, which are equipped with specialized stinging cells called nematocysts.</p>
<p>Aplostellis flabelliformis plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the biodiversity of reef and rock habitats.</p>
