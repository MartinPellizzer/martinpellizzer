<p>Alyssum alpinum, commonly known as alpine alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet, blooming in spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and silvery-gray, which helps reduce water loss in its arid, high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Alyssum alpinum is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
