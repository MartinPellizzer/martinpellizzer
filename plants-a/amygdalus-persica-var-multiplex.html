                    <h1>Amygdalus persica var. multiplex</h1>
<p>Amygdalus persica var. multiplex, commonly known as the multi-flowered peach.</p>
<p>This variant is a cultivar of the peach tree, characterized by its production of multiple flowers per cluster, which can enhance its ornamental value. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree with a spreading habit and smooth, gray bark. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, while the flowers are pinkish-white with a subtle fragrance.</p>
<p>The fruit, although less prominent than in standard peaches, can be edible and often has a sweeter flavor.</p>
