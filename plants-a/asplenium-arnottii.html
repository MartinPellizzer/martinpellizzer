<p>Asplenium arnottii, commonly known as the mountain maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous layer.</p>
