                        <h1>Abrahamia darainensis</h1>
<p>Abrahamia darainensis, commonly known as the Daraina sandveld daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. It is often found in the grasslands of the Eastern Cape and is valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Abrahamia darainensis belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises a group of vascular plants that includes horsetails and ferns. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species.</p>
<p>Its order is Sapindales, which consists of flowering plants with a wide range of morphological diversity. Its family is Anacardiaceae, known for containing plants with toxic compounds and species like the cashew and poison ivy. Its genus is Abrahamia, a small genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>Its species is Abrahamia darainensis, a specific type within the genus Abrahamia, characterized by its unique morphology and habitat preferences.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
