<p>Angraecum pergracile, commonly known as the slender angraecum, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pendant flowers that bloom in shades of white and green.

Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in conservation programs.</p>
