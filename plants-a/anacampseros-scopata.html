<p>Anacampseros scopata, commonly known as the desert sun rose, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens.</p>
