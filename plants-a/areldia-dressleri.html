                    <h1>Areldia dressleri</h1>
<p>Areldia dressleri, commonly known as the velvetleaf orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves and striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Areldia dressleri is under threat and is protected in several national parks and conservation areas.</p>
