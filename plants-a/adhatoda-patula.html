                <h1>Adhatoda patula</h1>
<p>Adhatoda patula, commonly known as the Indian Trumpet or Blue Trumpet, is a flowering plant native to India and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adhatoda patula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda patula has elliptical or ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that has a somewhat fibrous texture, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in inflorescences, typically pink or violet in color, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda patula is a flowering plant native to southern and eastern Asia, particularly found in countries like India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Although it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited, with populations primarily found in specific regions of India. It thrives in moist, tropical or subtropical environments, often growing in wetlands, marshes, or along riverbanks. Adhatoda patula is typically found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species and is listed on the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda patula is a fast-growing, ornamental plant known for its vibrant blue flowers and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for quick establishment. The plant thrives in warm climates and has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to encourage branching are essential for optimal growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adhatoda patula is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which feed on its seeds and foliage. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species by improving soil health. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes the soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Adhatoda patula contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and maintaining the balance of local ecosystems.</p>
