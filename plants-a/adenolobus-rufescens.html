                <h1>Adenolobus rufescens</h1>
<p>Adenolobus rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed adenolobus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in shrubland and grassland habitats, often in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, while the flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>Adenolobus rufescens is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenolobus rufescens has compound leaves that are pinnate, with leaflets that are oval-shaped, slightly serrated, and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, with a moderate size, ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that exudes a faint resin when cut. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers with four petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenolobus rufescens is primarily native to parts of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often in regions with high humidity and warm temperatures. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, typically growing in shaded undergrowth or along forest edges. It is often associated with moist, well-drained soils and is sometimes found in secondary growth areas.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Adenolobus rufescens is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenolobus rufescens was mainly introduced to new habitats in regions with suitable climate conditions, such as tropical and subtropical areas.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several countries across Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant thrives in moist environments and is often found near water bodies or in humid forests. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, careful monitoring is recommended to prevent its spread into native habitats.</p>
