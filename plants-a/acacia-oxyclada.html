                    <h1>Acacia oxyclada</h1>
<p>Acacia oxyclada, commonly known as the white acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures in mature plants. The plant produces yellow to golden flowers in dense, cylindrical spikes, which bloom during the rainy season. Its seeds are encased in elongated, woody pods that split open to release the seeds.</p>
<p>Acacia oxyclada is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and is often used for its hardy nature and potential medicinal properties.</p>
