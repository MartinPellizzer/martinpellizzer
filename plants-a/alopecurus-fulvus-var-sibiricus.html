                    <h1>Alopecurus fulvus var. sibiricus</h1>
<p>Alopecurus fulvus var. sibiricus, commonly known as Siberian mouse-ear, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant features slender, creeping stems with small, hairless leaves that are often covered in a fine, pale pubescence. Its flowers are pale blue to purple, clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and bloom from late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other species in the Poaceae family and is often used in ecological restoration due to its adaptability and soil-stabilizing properties.</p>
