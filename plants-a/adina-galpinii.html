                <h1>Adina galpinii</h1>
<p>Adina galpinii, commonly known as the Galpin's adina, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Adina galpinii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina galpinii has small, elliptical leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 2-4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are slender and upright, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plant's growth. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to the plant's arid habitat by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina galpinii is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Western Cape Province, particularly in the region around the towns of Worcester and Robertson. The plant grows in rocky, well-drained soils in open woodlands and along coastal cliffs. It is commonly associated with the fynbos vegetation type, which is characteristic of the area.</p>
<p>Adina galpinii is a small shrub that thrives in the Mediterranean climate of this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina galpinii was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces, where it outcompetes native vegetation. The plant spreads through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils contribute to its invasive nature.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
