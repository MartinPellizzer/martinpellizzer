                <h1>Aconitum anhuiense</h1>
<p>Aconitum anhuiense, commonly known as the Anhui aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy flowers. The plant produces blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are palmately divided with a distinctive appearance. Aconitum anhuiense contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum anhuiense has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring up to 20 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and erect, with a smooth, dark brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a vertical growth pattern. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with spurred petals and a complex structure that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies; they bloom in late summer to early autumn. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for storing nutrients and anchoring the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum anhuiense is primarily native to China Southeast.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of this area, particularly in the provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang. This plant thrives in humid, temperate climates with well-drained soil. It is commonly found in forested areas and along stream sides.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum anhuiense was mainly introduced to the temperate regions of East Asia, particularly in China, where it is native.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in gardens and botanical collections due to its ornamental value and unique floral structure. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its introduction to horticultural practices has increased in recent years, especially among plant enthusiasts interested in rare and native species.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that it should be handled with care, as it contains toxic alkaloids.</p>
