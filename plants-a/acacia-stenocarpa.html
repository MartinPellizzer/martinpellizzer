                        <h1>Acacia stenocarpa</h1>
<p>Acacia stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruit acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical pods and small, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in winter, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in coastal regions and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Acacia stenocarpa is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia stenocarpa is primarily native to Australia, specifically the western and central regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the states of Western Australia, South Australia, and the Northern Territory. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It is well adapted to the dry climate and can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
<p>Acacia stenocarpa is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia stenocarpa was mainly introduced to regions with dry to semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and high solar exposure, making it suitable for arid and coastal environments. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fuelwood in its native range. Its introduction has also been noted in some parts of Australia and the Mediterranean, where it has adapted well to similar environmental conditions.</p>
<p>However, its spread can sometimes lead to ecological impacts in non-native areas.</p>
