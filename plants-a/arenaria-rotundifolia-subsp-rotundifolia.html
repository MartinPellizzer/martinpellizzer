<p>Arenaria rotundifolia subsp.</p>
<p>rotundifolia, commonly known as the rounded sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its compact growth habit and frost-resistant nature make it a hardy species often found in tundra and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its consistently rounded leaf shape and its ability to survive in extreme climatic conditions.</p>
