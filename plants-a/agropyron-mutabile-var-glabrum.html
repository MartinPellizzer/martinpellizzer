<p>Agropyron mutabile var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
