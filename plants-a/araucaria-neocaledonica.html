<p>Araucaria neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonian Araucaria, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the island of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of dense, feathery foliage composed of scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited geographic range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
