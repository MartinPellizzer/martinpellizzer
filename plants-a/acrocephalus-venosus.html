<p>Acrocephalus venosus, commonly known as the common reed, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense clumps in wetland environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are long, narrow, and have a prominent venation pattern, which is a key identifying feature.</p>
<p>Acrocephalus venosus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and avian species.</p>
