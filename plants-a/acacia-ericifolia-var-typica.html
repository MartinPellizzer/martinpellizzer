                        <h1>Acacia ericifolia var. typica</h1>
<p>Acacia ericifolia var. typica, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, dense foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a woody stem with thorn-like structures, which help it survive in harsh, saline environments. Its leaves are small and leathery, reducing water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often used in coastal stabilization due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in sandy soils.</p>
