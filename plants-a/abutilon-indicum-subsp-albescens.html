<p>Abutilon indicum subsp.</p>
<p>albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered Chinese lantern, is a herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and showy, pendulous flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow.</p>
<p>The plant produces capsules that contain numerous small, brown seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon indicum subsp.</p>
<p>albescens has ovate to lanceolate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a smooth surface and a pale green color, ranging in size from 5 to 10 cm in length. The stem is cylindrical, with a light gray bark that is smooth when young and becomes slightly fissured with age, exhibiting an erect growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are pendulous, with five petals and a yellowish-green calyx, blooming in clusters during the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
