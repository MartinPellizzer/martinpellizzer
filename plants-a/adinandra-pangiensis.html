                <h1>Adinandra pangiensis</h1>
<p>Adinandra pangiensis, commonly known as the Pangiensis Adinandra, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myristicaceae, which includes nutmeg and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra pangiensis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, fragrant flowers are arranged in clusters, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, and bloom during the rainy season, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animal consumption and droppings.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, nutrient-rich soil of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra pangiensis is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the rainforests of this tropical island, specifically in the western part of the region. The plant thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing along riverbanks and in secondary forest areas. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within Borneo's diverse ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra pangiensis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and requires high humidity to support its growth. The plant is commonly found in forest understories, where it competes with other shade-tolerant species. Its introduction has been noted in several regions outside its native range, often as a result of horticultural trade.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains largely unstudied in these new habitats.</p>
