                    <h1>Alchemilla pubescens var. plicata</h1>
<p>Alchemilla pubescens var. plicata, commonly known as the wrinkled lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often curled or folded, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its common name reflects the historical belief that it could be used in alchemical processes, though it is primarily valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens.</p>
