                <h1>Acrostichum salicinum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum salicinum, commonly known as the broadleaf tree fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a robust, trunk-like stem covered in a fibrous, spongy material. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing cones, are typically found at the base of the fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum salicinum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum salicinum has long, lance-shaped leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 20â€“30 cm in length and have a smooth, glossy texture. The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a light brown bark that is smooth and slightly fibrous. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in early spring and are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when it dries and splits open.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum salicinum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist lowland areas, riverbanks, and coastal regions where it thrives in humid climates. This plant is often associated with mangrove ecosystems and can be found in brackish water environments. It is also present in parts of northeastern Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to areas with high rainfall and well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum salicinum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions where human activity has altered natural habitats. This plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and often colonizes stream banks and roadside ditches. Its introduction has led to its spread in parts of North America and Europe.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
