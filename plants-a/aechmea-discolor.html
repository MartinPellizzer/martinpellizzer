<p>Aechmea discolor, commonly known as the pink pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant pink to red foliage, which becomes more intense as the plant matures. The plant features a central rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water in a central cup, a common adaptation for storing moisture in arid environments. Aechmea discolor produces showy, spike-like inflorescences that bear white or pale pink flowers, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
