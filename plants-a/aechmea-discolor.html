                <h1>Aechmea discolor</h1>
<p>Aechmea discolor, commonly known as the pink pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant pink to red foliage, which becomes more intense as the plant matures. The plant features a central rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water in a central cup, a common adaptation for storing moisture in arid environments. Aechmea discolor produces showy, spike-like inflorescences that bear white or pale pink flowers, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea discolor has rosette-shaped leaves that are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in a spiral pattern around the central stem, with a bluish-green color and a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upward from the base. The plant produces inflorescences with clustered, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing moisture from the surrounding soil.</p>
