                <h1>Achillea trevidiciana</h1>
<p>Achillea trevidiciana, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, silvery-green leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to cold, harsh climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea trevidiciana has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a silvery-gray underside and a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a grayish-green color, growing in a clumping pattern. Its flowers are compound, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of darker yellow tubular florets, blooming from June to August and pollinated by insects. The plant produces small, dry fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind due to their feathery pappus.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping it to spread and establish in suitable habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea trevidiciana is primarily native to Spain.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions across the Iberian Peninsula. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky or gravelly soils. It is commonly observed in Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to southern and central Spain.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea trevidiciana was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and disturbed soils across the United States and Canada. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has shown invasive tendencies in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant's rapid spread has led to concerns among ecologists and land managers.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its distribution and prevent further ecological disruption.</p>
