                <h1>Achillea trevidiciana</h1>
<p>Achillea trevidiciana, commonly known as the Southernwood, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features silver-gray, aromatic leaves and yellow-rayed flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils adds to its botanical significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea trevidiciana has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and has a grayish-brown bark with a rough texture, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and establish in suitable habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea trevidiciana is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in countries such as Spain, France, and Italy.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Iberian Peninsula and the southern Alps, though its range has become increasingly restricted. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and open slopes, often found in Mediterranean shrublands. This species typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea trevidiciana is a hardy perennial plant known for its showy yellow flowers and adaptability to various conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. The plant has a biennial growth cycle, flowering in the first year and producing seeds in the second before dying back.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like thyme or rosemary can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea trevidiciana is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both nectar and habitat. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. It also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea trevidiciana contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
