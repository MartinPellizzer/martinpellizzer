<p>Abies concolor f. brevifolia, commonly known as the white fir dwarf form, is a variant of the white fir tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to the typical white fir. The foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are typically light green and covered in a waxy cuticle. Its cones are generally small and conical, maturing to a reddish-brown color.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in high-elevation forests and is adapted to cooler, moist environments.</p>
