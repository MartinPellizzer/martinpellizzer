                    <h1>Androsace elongata var. typica</h1>
<p>Androsace elongata var. typica, commonly known as the elongated sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense cushions of succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its compact form and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine plantings.</p>
