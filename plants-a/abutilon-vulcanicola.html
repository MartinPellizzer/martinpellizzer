                        <h1>Abutilon vulcanicola</h1>
<p>Abutilon vulcanicola, commonly known as the volcanic abutilon, is a unique species native to the volcanic regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils and is adapted to the high temperatures and low humidity of its native habitat. It is often found growing in rocky or disturbed areas near volcanic formations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon vulcanicola is primarily native to the volcanic regions of the Galápagos Islands.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in the unique microclimates found on the islands' slopes and coastal areas. It is commonly found in rocky and well-drained soils, often growing near lava flows. The species is adapted to the nutrient-poor volcanic soil and high-altitude conditions of the archipelago.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within the Galápagos ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon vulcanicola was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in warm, humid environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers. It has been introduced to several parts of the world, including Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions, where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
