                <h1>Acridocarpus ferrugineus</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus ferrugineus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, reddish-brown wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with small, elliptical leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus ferrugineus has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they are relatively narrow and elongated.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub with a compact, upright form. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb water efficiently from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus ferrugineus is primarily native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in various regions across the country, including the eastern and southern parts. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of the island. It is part of the family Anacardiaceae and is known for its distinctive foliage and fruiting structures.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Madagascar.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus ferrugineus was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was originally native to Southeast Asia and was later brought to New Zealand in the 19th century. The plant has since become established in certain regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. It is considered a potential weed in some parts of its introduced range.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, its spread has raised concerns among conservationists.</p>
