                <h1>Achillea serrulata</h1>
<p>Achillea serrulata, commonly known as narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely serrated, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its aromatic foliage and historical use in traditional medicine contribute to its ecological and cultural significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea serrulata has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, serrated along the edges, and arranged in a rosette formation, with a dark green color and a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and covered with fine hairs, rising from the base and exhibiting a grayish-green color. The flowers are small, clustered in flat-topped umbels, with white petals and yellow centers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea serrulata is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open, dry habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. This plant thrives in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. It is often seen along roadsides and in chaparral communities.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones where it can receive adequate sunlight and well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea serrulata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in many regions. Its spread is particularly rapid in disturbed soils and along coastal areas.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic value, it poses a significant threat to local ecosystems.</p>
