                    <h1>Anisophyllum caecorum</h1>
<p>Anisophyllum caecorum, commonly known as the blind fern, is a rare and unusual member of the fern family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a stipe that is often shorter than the blade, and a distinct lack of true roots. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
