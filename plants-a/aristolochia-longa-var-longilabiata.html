                    <h1>Aristolochia longa var. longilabiata</h1>
<p>Aristolochia longa var. longilabiata, commonly known as the long-lipped Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and its unique, pipe-like flowers that are often a deep purple or maroon color. The flowers have a complex structure with a narrow, elongated tube that gives the plant its common name. It produces small, green berries that are edible but should be consumed with caution due to the presence of aristolochic acids.</p>
<p>This plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and unusual floral form.</p>
