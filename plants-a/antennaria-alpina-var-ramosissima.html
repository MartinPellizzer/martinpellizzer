                    <h1>Antennaria alpina var. ramosissima</h1>
<p>Antennaria alpina var. ramosissima, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-eared cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and often covered in fine, silvery pubescence, adapting to cold and arid conditions.</p>
<p>It is well-suited to high-altitude environments and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes.</p>
