                    <h1>Antennaria dioica var. congesta</h1>
<p>Antennaria dioica var. congesta, commonly known as the clustered mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often covering the entire plant. The leaves are spoon-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and wetlands.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to other forms of Antennaria dioica.</p>
