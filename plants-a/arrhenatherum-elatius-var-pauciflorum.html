                    <h1>Arrhenatherum elatius var. pauciflorum</h1>
<p>Arrhenatherum elatius var. pauciflorum, commonly known as the slender wood oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, pale green to brownish flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its reduced flowering, with fewer spikelets compared to the typical form of Arrhenatherum elatius.</p>
