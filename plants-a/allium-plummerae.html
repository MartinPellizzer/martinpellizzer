                    <h1>Allium plummerae</h1>
<p>Allium plummerae, commonly known as the desert leek, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic-like flavor, making it a useful plant for both culinary and medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>Allium plummerae is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
