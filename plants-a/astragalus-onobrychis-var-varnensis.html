<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
