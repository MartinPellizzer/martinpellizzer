<p>Asclepias alata, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the eastern and central United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores.</p>
<p>Asclepias alata is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, supporting their life cycle.</p>
