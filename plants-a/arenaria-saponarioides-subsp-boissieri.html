<p>Arenaria saponarioides subsp.</p>
<p>boissieri, commonly known as the Boissier's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance.</p>
