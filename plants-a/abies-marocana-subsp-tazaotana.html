<p>Abies marocana subsp.</p>
<p>tazaotana, commonly known as the Tazaotan fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the Atlas Mountains of Morocco. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and conical shape, typical of the fir genus.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Its cones are small and cylindrical, containing winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss.</p>
