                <h1>Acrostichum unitum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum unitum, commonly known as the common brake, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum unitum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically bright green, with a broad, feather-like shape and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is sturdy and has a rough, fibrous bark that is often a deep brown or reddish color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, with yellowish-green petals and a wind-pollination method, blooming during the late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Its fruit is a spiky, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum unitum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, riverbanks, and wetlands where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. This plant is also present in some Caribbean islands and the southern United States, particularly in Florida. It is well adapted to saline and brackish environments, making it a common species in mangrove ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends from Mexico through the Caribbean to northern South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum unitum was mainly introduced to coastal and wetland areas in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, saline environments and is often found in marshes and along shorelines. This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to changes in local ecosystems and habitat structure.</p>
<p>Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its ecological impact.</p>
