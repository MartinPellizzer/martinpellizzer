                    <h1>Andropogon insularis</h1>
<p>Andropogon insularis, commonly known as the Bahama grass, is a perennial grass native to the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, exhibiting a clump-forming habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it resilient in coastal environments.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
