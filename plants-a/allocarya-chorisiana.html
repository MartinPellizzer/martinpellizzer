                    <h1>Allocarya chorisiana</h1>
<p>Allocarya chorisiana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has no leaves and relies entirely on its roots for photosynthesis, which are often covered in a dense, white, sponge-like tissue. Its flowers are small, white, and highly fragrant, typically blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Allocarya chorisiana is considered critically endangered.</p>
