<p>Arthropteris altescandens, commonly known as the rock holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, including regions of China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are often used in rock gardens due to their ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread slowly and form dense mats. Its leaves are typically divided into small, serrated segments, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Arthropteris altescandens is well adapted to rocky or forested habitats and is often found growing on soil or among rocks in humid climates.</p>
