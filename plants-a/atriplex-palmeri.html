<p>Atriplex palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's saltbush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are borne on short peduncles. Its salt tolerance allows it to thrive in saline soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Atriplex palmeri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
