The plant produces panicles of small, pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in arid regions for landscaping purposes.</p>
