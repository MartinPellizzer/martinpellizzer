                <h1>Adenandra crenata</h1>
<p>Adenandra crenata, commonly known as the silver tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. These flowers are followed by small, round, orange-red fruits that contain a single seed.</p>
<p>Adenandra crenata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra crenata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and aiding in the plant's survival in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra crenata is primarily native to South Africa, specifically the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and fynbos vegetation. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen in open, sunny habitats. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, with dry summers and wet winters.</p>
<p>Adenandra crenata is an important component of the local flora and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra crenata was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it is commonly found in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated in gardens and public spaces due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and suburban environments. It is also used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate mild drought conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions, leading to management efforts to control its spread.</p>
