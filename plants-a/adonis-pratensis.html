                <h1>Adonis pratensis</h1>
<p>Adonis pratensis, commonly known as the meadow adonis, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy, early spring blooms. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers are yellow with prominent stamens.</p>
<p>It is often considered a rare and declining species due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis pratensis has basal leaves that are narrow, linear to lanceolate in shape, arranged in a rosette, and are typically bluish-green in color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a rough texture, with a reddish-brown color, growing from the base of the plant. The flowers are yellow, tubular with a prominent yellow corolla, and bloom in late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through a slit, and the seeds are small, winged, and dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in grasslands and meadows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis pratensis is primarily native to the temperate regions of Europe, including the British Isles, northern Spain, and parts of southern Scandinavia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky outcrops where the climate is cool and moist. This plant thrives in open habitats with well-drained soils, often growing in association with other alpine and subalpine flora. Its native range extends into parts of western Asia, particularly in the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It is not native to North America or Africa, but has been introduced to some regions outside its original range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis pratensis was mainly introduced to the data as a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. The plant is known for its showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. It has been documented in various ecological studies due to its role in supporting pollinators.</p>
<p>However, its introduction to new regions may pose challenges due to its potential to become invasive.</p>
