                    <h1>Aniba firmula</h1>
<p>Aniba firmula, commonly known as Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces dark blue, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid lowland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
