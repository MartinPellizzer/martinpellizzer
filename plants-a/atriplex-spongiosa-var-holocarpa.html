<p>Atriplex spongiosa var. holocarpa, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in saline soils, making it an important species in ecological restoration.</p>
<p>The woody stems and hairy leaves contribute to its drought resistance and overall hardiness.</p>
