                <h1>Adenanthos strictus</h1>
<p>Adenanthos strictus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved adenanthos, is a low-growing shrub native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate floral display. It is typically found in dry, sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments.</p>
<p>Adenanthos strictus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in native gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthos strictus has narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, and exhibit a bluish-green color with a fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to efficiently absorb moisture from the well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos strictus is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the Geraldton and Esperance districts. This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas and inland heathlands. It is commonly seen in open woodlands and shrublands with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
<p>Adenanthos strictus is well adapted to the dry and sunny conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos strictus was mainly introduced to urban and coastal areas of southern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides where it thrives in full sun. The plant is known for its compact, shrub-like form and its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions. It has been used in horticulture for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>However, it is also considered a potential weed in some regions due to its rapid growth and spread.</p>
