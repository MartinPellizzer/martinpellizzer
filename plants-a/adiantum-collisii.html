                <h1>Adiantum collisii</h1>
<p>Adiantum collisii, commonly known as the mountain maidenhair fern, is a delicate and graceful fern species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are typically bright green and turn a reddish-brown in the autumn, adding seasonal interest.</p>
<p>Adiantum collisii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ability to thrive in shaded, humid conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum collisii has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance, typically measuring 10-30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color and a smooth, glossy surface. The stem is slender and upright, with a light greenish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly fibrous. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, appearing in late spring, and the fruit is a cluster of spores rather than true seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant securely to rocky or soil substrates.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum collisii is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and rocky outcrops. This fern thrives in humid climates and is often associated with subtropical and tropical regions. Its distribution includes parts of Lesotho, Eswatini, and the eastern Cape Province.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the specific microhabitats it occupies within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum collisii was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures, making it well-suited for temperate climates. This plant is often found in the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Georgia, Tennessee, and North Carolina. Its introduction has been largely due to its ornamental value and adaptability to cultivated gardens.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is grown.</p>
