<p>Anoectochilus intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate toothed orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and distinctive, intricate flowers with a unique structure. The plant typically grows on trees in shaded, humid environments, relying on its host for support rather than soil. Its flowers, which are often pink or purple, bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
