<p>Adiantum induratum, commonly known as the hardy maidenhair fern, is a species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a slightly glossy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and thrives in well-draining, humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantum induratum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of care.</p>
