                <h1>Adiantum induratum</h1>
<p>Adiantum induratum, commonly known as the hardy maidenhair fern, is a species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a slightly glossy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and thrives in well-draining, humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantum induratum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum induratum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, typically ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green, with a slightly curled margin, and are arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows in a straight, branching pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, which are wind-pollinated and lack showy petals or sepals.</p>
<p>The fruit is a spore-bearing capsule that releases spores into the air, and the plant has fibrous roots that help anchor it to rocky or moist soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum induratum is primarily native to China South-Central, China Southeast, Hainan, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. It thrives in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. Adiantum induratum is often associated with limestone substrates in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic areas in Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum induratum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and stream banks. This plant has become naturalized in several areas, often outcompeting native species. Its introduction is largely due to human activities, including garden planting and accidental spread.</p>
<p>It is considered a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
