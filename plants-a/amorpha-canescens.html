<p>Amorpha canescens, commonly known as wild indigo, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its gray-green, hairy foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across its native range.</p>
