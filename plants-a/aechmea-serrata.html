                <h1>Aechmea serrata</h1>
<p>Aechmea serrata, commonly known as the serrated pineapple plant, is a bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are stiff and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with bright red bracts that house small, fragrant flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated as a decorative plant in many regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea serrata has strap-shaped, sword-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, with a waxy, bluish-green color and a serrated edge.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, thick stem that is covered in a fibrous, pale green bark and grows upright from the base. Its flowers are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence, with vibrant red bracts that enclose small, white or pale yellow flowers, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, three-lobed berry that matures into a dark purple color, dispersing seeds through animal consumption and wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network around the base of the plant, helping to anchor it and absorb moisture.</p>
