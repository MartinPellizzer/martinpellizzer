                        <h1>Abolboda psammophila</h1>
<p>Abolboda psammophila, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, showcasing a remarkable ability to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, adding a splash of color to its arid habitat. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to minimize water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Abolboda psammophila plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity in its native ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abolboda psammophila is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, and parts of the Sahara Desert. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is well adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to areas with low rainfall and high solar exposure.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abolboda psammophila was mainly introduced to sandy and arid environments where it can thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with low rainfall and high temperatures, such as deserts and coastal dunes. This plant has been observed spreading along disturbed areas, often outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor and manage its spread to prevent ecological imbalance.</p>
