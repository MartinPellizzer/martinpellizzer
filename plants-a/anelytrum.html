                    <h1>Anelytrum</h1>
<p>Anelytrum, commonly known as the spiny leaf cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in countries like Argentina and Chile. The plants are characterized by their spiny stems and reduced leaves, which help in reducing water loss in harsh environments. Anelytrum species typically produce vibrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>These cacti are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their unique appearance and ability to thrive in low-water conditions.</p>
