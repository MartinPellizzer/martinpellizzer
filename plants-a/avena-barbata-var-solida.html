<p>Avena barbata var. solida, commonly known as the rigid oat, is a perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are encased in a hard, bristly husk, which aids in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
