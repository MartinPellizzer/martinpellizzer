                    <h1>Agave prostrata</h1>
<p>Agave prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern and are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces yellowish-green flowers on a tall stem, which bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
