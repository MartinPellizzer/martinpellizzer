The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense, cone-shaped inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in wet soils.</p>
<p>Its foliage is often variegated with shades of green, red, and yellow, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens.</p>
