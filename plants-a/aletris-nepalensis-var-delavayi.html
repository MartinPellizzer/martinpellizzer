The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale green flowers in dense clusters. It is adapted to cold climates and has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in poor soil.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and potential horticultural value.</p>
