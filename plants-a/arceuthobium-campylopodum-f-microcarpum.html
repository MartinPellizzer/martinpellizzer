                    <h1>Arceuthobium campylopodum f. microcarpum</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium campylopodum f. microcarpum, commonly known as the dwarf sand-verbena broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on species of the genus Hesperocallis. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds through a unique mechanism called autochory. Its morphology is adapted for parasitic growth, with reduced leaves and a specialized root system for attachment to host roots.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its smaller, more compact fruiting bodies compared to the typical form.</p>
