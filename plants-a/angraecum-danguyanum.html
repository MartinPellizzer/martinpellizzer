                    <h1>Angraecum danguyanum</h1>
<p>Angraecum danguyanum, commonly known as the Danguyanum orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, pendant inflorescences that bear large, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose substrate to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and nocturnal blooming habit make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings.</p>
