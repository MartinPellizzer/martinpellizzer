<p>Asplenium schnellii, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the leaves. Asplenium schnellii is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices, thriving in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat make it a notable species in the study of epiphytic and lithophytic plants.</p>
