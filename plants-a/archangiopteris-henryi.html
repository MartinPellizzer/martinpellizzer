                    <h1>Archangiopteris henryi</h1>
<p>Archangiopteris henryi, commonly known as the Henry's archangiopteris, is a rare and ancient fern species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a complex venation pattern. The plant exhibits a primitive morphology, with fertile fronds bearing sori that are clustered in lines along the underside. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in forest understories, and is considered a relict species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Archangiopteris henryi is of significant interest to botanists studying evolutionary plant development.</p>
