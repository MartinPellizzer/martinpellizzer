                <h1>Aconitum divaricatum</h1>
<p>Aconitum divaricatum, commonly known as the variable monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, helmet-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately lobed leaves with a distinctive veining pattern, and its stems are usually hairy and upright. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum divaricatum has compound, doubly pinnate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a finely toothed margin, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat woody at the base, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are blue to violet, arranged in dense terminal spikes, with showy petals and prominent spurs, blooming in late summer and attracting insect pollinators like bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients and surviving in colder climates.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum divaricatum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and parts of Russia.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This plant is well adapted to cold climates and is commonly found in the Himalayas and surrounding areas. It prefers well-drained soils and is often associated with temperate and subalpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>Aconitum divaricatum is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking purple or blue flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum divaricatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. This plant is often mistaken for native aconite species due to its similar appearance. It has become a concern in some regions due to its invasive potential.</p>
<p>Its spread is attributed to both natural seed dispersal and human activity.</p>
