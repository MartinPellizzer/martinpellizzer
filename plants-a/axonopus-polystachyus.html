                    <h1>Axonopus polystachyus</h1>
<p>Axonopus polystachyus, commonly known as the hairy sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along water edges, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Axonopus polystachyus produces small, clustered flower spikes, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
