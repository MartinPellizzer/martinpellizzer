                <h1>Adesmia rubroviridis</h1>
<p>Adesmia rubroviridis, commonly known as the red-veined legume, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with reddish veins and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, showcasing adaptations to drought conditions. Its pods contain edible seeds that are sometimes used in traditional cuisines.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and nitrogen-fixing abilities in soil.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia rubroviridis has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with five pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia rubroviridis is primarily native to Chile Central.</p>
<p>It is found in the central region of Chile, particularly in the Andean foothills and coastal areas. This plant thrives in dry to semi-arid environments with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in open grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to this specific geographic area within Chile.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia rubroviridis was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its vibrant red and green foliage. The plant has since spread beyond its initial introduction sites, becoming established in several countries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to a variety of environments.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential has raised concerns among local ecosystems.</p>
