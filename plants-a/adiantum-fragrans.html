                    <h1>Adiantum fragrans</h1>
<p>Adiantum fragrans, commonly known as the sweet fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often described as resembling the leaves of a fern in a more refined and elegant form. The plant produces small, fragrant spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Adiantum fragrans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance.</p>
