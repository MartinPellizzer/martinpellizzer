                <h1>Adiantum fragrans</h1>
<p>Adiantum fragrans, commonly known as the sweet fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often described as resembling the leaves of a fern in a more refined and elegant form. The plant produces small, fragrant spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Adiantum fragrans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum fragrans has fern-like leaves that are bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 10â€“20 cm in length, with a light green color that turns darker towards the veins. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a smooth, pale green bark that grows from the base upward. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum fragrans is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments like forest floors and mountainous areas. This fern is commonly associated with humid climates and is often found in the understory of dense vegetation. Its native range extends to parts of the Indian subcontinent as well, including northeastern India and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Adiantum fragrans is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climatic conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum fragrans was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The plant is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses due to its attractive, delicate fronds. Its introduction has been primarily for horticultural purposes rather than for ecological reasons.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that in some regions, it may become invasive if not properly managed.</p>
