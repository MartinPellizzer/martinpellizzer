<p>Androsace septentrionalis var. glandulosa, commonly known as the northern sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features a dense mat of small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are typically arranged in a cyme. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
