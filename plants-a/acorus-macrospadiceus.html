                <h1>Acorus macrospadiceus</h1>
<p>Acorus macrospadiceus, commonly known as the broad-leaved sweetflag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Asia.</p>
<p>It features long, sword-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces yellowish-green spadices, which are the male flowers, followed by green, spadix-like female flowers. It thrives in shallow water and is often used in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties.</p>
<p>Acorus macrospadiceus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus macrospadiceus has long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, with a bright green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>Its stem is tall and erect, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a single, unbranched pattern. The plant produces yellow-green inflorescences composed of small, spadix-like flowers, which bloom in early spring and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, three-lobed berry that disperses its seeds through water, as the seeds are buoyant.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming a dense network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus macrospadiceus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of stagnant water bodies. This plant thrives in humid and tropical climates, often growing in shallow water or moist soil. It is an important component of the local aquatic ecosystems in these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of water and the specific environmental conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus macrospadiceus was mainly introduced to aquatic and wetland environments due to its ability to thrive in shallow, water-saturated soils.</p>
<p>It is often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams and rivers. The plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and its potential use in phytoremediation. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now expanding beyond its native range due to human activities and climate change.</p>
