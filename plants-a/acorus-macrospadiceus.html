<p>Acorus macrospadiceus, commonly known as the broad-leaved sweetflag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Asia.</p>
<p>It features long, sword-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces yellowish-green spadices, which are the male flowers, followed by green, spadix-like female flowers. It thrives in shallow water and is often used in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties.</p>
<p>Acorus macrospadiceus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
