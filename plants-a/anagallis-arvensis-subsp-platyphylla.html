<p>Anagallis arvensis subsp.</p>
<p>platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its fleshy, broadly ovate leaves and small, pale pink to white flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically blooms from May to July, producing clusters of five-petaled flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its subspecies status reflects slight morphological differences from the typical form of Anagallis arvensis.</p>
