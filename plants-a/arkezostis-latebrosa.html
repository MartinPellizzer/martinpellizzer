                    <h1>Arkezostis latebrosa</h1>
<p>Arkezostis latebrosa, commonly known as the hidden beard lichen, is a rare and cryptic lichen species that thrives in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form. The thallus is typically pale gray to brown, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. It is often found on bark and stone in temperate forests, where it plays a role in nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is of interest to mycologists and conservationists.</p>
