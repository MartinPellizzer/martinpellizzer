<p>Acacia gerrardi subsp.</p>
<p>negevensis, commonly known as the Negev acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Israel and the Negev Desert. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, feathery leaves that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
