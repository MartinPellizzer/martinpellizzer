<p>Acacia gerrardi subsp.</p>
<p>negevensis, commonly known as the Negev acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Israel and the Negev Desert. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, feathery leaves that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia gerrardi subsp.</p>
<p>negevensis is primarily native to the Negev Desert in Israel. It is found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in rocky and sandy soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region, including high temperatures and limited rainfall. It often grows in association with other desert flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of the area.</p>
<p>The plant is an important component of the local vegetation, providing habitat and resources for various desert animals.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia gerrardi subsp.</p>
<p>negevensis was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape region. It was brought there for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides due to its hardy nature. It has also been introduced to other parts of southern Africa, including Namibia and Botswana.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited due to its preference for specific soil and climate conditions.</p>
