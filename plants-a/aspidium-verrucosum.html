<p>Aspidium verrucosum, commonly known as the疣足蕨, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered with small, raised dots or warts, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Aspidium verrucosum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage.</p>
