<p>Amyema mackayensis subsp.</p>
<p>cycnei-sinus, commonly known as the Mackay's amyema, is a rare subshrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pale pink to white in color, blooming during the cooler months.</p>
<p>The plant has a compact growth habit with woody stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. It is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
