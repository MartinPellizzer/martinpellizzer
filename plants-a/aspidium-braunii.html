<p>Aspidium braunii, commonly known as the Braun's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, contributing to water clarity by reducing algal growth.</p>
<p>Aspidium braunii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
