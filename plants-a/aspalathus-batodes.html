                    <h1>Aspalathus batodes</h1>
<p>Aspalathus batodes, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is closely related to the more well-known rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) and shares similar growing conditions. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a dry climate with adequate sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commercially cultivated species compared to its relative.</p>
