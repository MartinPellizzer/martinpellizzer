                    <h1>Arceuthobium campylopodum f. typicum</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium campylopodum f. typicum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed dwarf broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and typically attaches to the roots of host plants such as Ericaceae species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or pale in color. It is found in temperate regions and is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in the ecological interactions of its host plants.</p>
