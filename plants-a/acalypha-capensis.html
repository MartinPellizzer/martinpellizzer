                        <h1>Acalypha capensis</h1>
<p>Acalypha capensis, commonly known as the Cape spurge, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with smooth, often hairy stems and palmately lobed leaves. It produces greenish-yellow cyathium inflorescences, which are clustered in groups of three, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Acalypha capensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a resilient choice for coastal and sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha capensis is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the eastern and western regions of the country. This plant thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils along the Atlantic and Indian Ocean coasts. It is also present in parts of Namibia and into the northern regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>Acalypha capensis is often associated with rocky outcrops and dune environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha capensis was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, urban areas, and along riverbanks. The plant is often regarded as an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through human activity, possibly as a ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small animals.</p>
