                    <h1>Artemisia serotina</h1>
<p>Artemisia serotina, commonly known as late-blooming sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and aromatic, resinous scent, which is due to the presence of volatile compounds like thujone. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late summer, typically blooming after most other Artemisia species. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species.</p>
