                    <h1>Anthoxanthum arcticum</h1>
<p>Anthoxanthum arcticum, commonly known as Arctic oat, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found in tundra and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale yellow to brown flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Anthoxanthum arcticum plays a vital role in the ecosystem by providing food for herbivores and contributing to soil structure.</p>
