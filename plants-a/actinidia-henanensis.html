<p>Actinidia henanensis, commonly known as Henan kiwifruit, is a deciduous vine native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Actinidiaceae family and is closely related to the kiwifruit species. The plant produces small, hairy, green berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a serrated margin and are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its fruit, which is used in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia henanensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and a moderate size, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern.

The fruit is a small, yellowish berry that matures in late summer, and it is dispersed by birds and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread horizontally, providing stability and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia henanensis is primarily native to China, specifically the Henan province.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of central China, particularly in the Hengduan Mountains. This plant thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is commonly found in forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to specific areas within China, making it a regionally significant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia henanensis was mainly introduced to eastern and central China, particularly in the provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Shaanxi.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. This species is often found in forested areas and along stream banks, where it forms dense undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value and potential for ecological benefits, it has been cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains relatively localized compared to more widespread Actinidia species.</p>
