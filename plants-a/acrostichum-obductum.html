                <h1>Acrostichum obductum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum obductum, commonly known as the broadleaf hanger, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery, compound leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks and in dense forests. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with each leaflet having a smooth, waxy surface.</p>
<p>Acrostichum obductum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum obductum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes silvery underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is upright and woody with a smooth, grayish-brown bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses its seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's spread.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum obductum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangrove swamps, and along riverbanks where it thrives in moist, saline environments. This plant is well adapted to humid climates and is often associated with brackish water habitats. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the Indo-Malayan region, where it is a common component of coastal vegetation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum obductum was mainly introduced to disturbed areas such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along waterways.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetland environments. The plant is known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it a potential invasive species in some regions. It is commonly used for erosion control due to its dense root system.</p>
<p>However, its introduction can lead to competition with native plants, altering local ecosystems.</p>
