                <h1>Acer campestre var. glabratum</h1>
<p>Acer campestre var. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth field maple, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree or shrub native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and open areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is a popular choice for landscaping and conservation planting.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. glabratum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and a size ranging from 4 to 8 inches in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, turning yellow in autumn. The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a spreading, multi-stemmed pattern. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, arranged in panicle clusters, which are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, a winged capsule, that disperses by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. glabratum is a variant of the European mountain maple, native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of Europe and North America, where it is occasionally cultivated. It thrives in temperate climates, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. This species typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its limited natural range makes it vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. glabratum is a compact, ornamental maple known for its vibrant fall color and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seed propagation requiring cold stratification for successful germination. This species exhibits a slow to moderate growth cycle, often reaching maturity within 10â€“15 years, making it suitable for small gardens or as a hedging plant.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be minimal, with light feeding in spring, and pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and improve soil health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. glabratum is a small, shrub-like species that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, yellow flowers. Its dense growth acts as a companion plant, offering protection to smaller plants in mixed landscapes. The plant also helps in erosion control due to its fibrous root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity in woodland and hedgerow habitats.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. glabratum is a small deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been historically used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. The tree plays a role in industrial and economic contexts by providing habitat and food for wildlife, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem services. Culturally, it is appreciated for its aesthetic appeal in landscaping and as a symbol of resilience in natural environments.</p>
<p>Its role in supporting local ecosystems makes it valuable for conservation and environmental restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. glabratum has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, including 'Tarn' and 'Lindenii', which showcase attractive foliage and compact growth.</p>
<p>It is also a parent species in various hybrids, such as those contributing to the development of the popular 'Autumn Spire' and 'Emerald Grotto' maples. These hybrids often combine the hardiness of Acer campestre with the vibrant autumn colors of other maple species. The variety and its cultivars hold significant horticultural importance due to their adaptability to a range of soil conditions and climates.</p>
<p>They are frequently used in landscaping for their aesthetic appeal and resilience.</p>
