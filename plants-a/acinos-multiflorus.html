                <h1>Acinos multiflorus</h1>
<p>Acinos multiflorus, commonly known as the Sierra starflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. It is adapted to dry, sunny conditions and produces numerous small, showy blooms.</p>
<p>The Sierra starflower plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos multiflorus has leaves that are typically narrow, linear to lanceolate in shape, with a silver-gray to gray-green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stems are usually erect and branched, with a smooth, greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom in early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene, and seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and pappus structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos multiflorus is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and inland regions, including the Santa Monica Mountains and the Transverse Ranges. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often associated with chaparral and scrub habitats. It is also found in parts of Oregon and Nevada, where it grows in similar environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Acinos multiflorus is an important component of the native flora in these regions, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos multiflorus was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in open grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. This plant thrives in environments with moderate to high elevations and is often associated with disturbed or semi-arid habitats. Its introduction has been noted in various restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soils.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns about potential impacts on native flora in certain ecosystems.</p>
