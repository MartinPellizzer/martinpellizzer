                    <h1>Anthurium subcaudatum</h1>
<p>Anthurium subcaudatum, commonly known as the red-tailed anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish or purplish tinge on the underside. The plant produces spadices, which are clustered inflorescences that are often bright red or yellow, surrounded by a showy spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Anthurium subcaudatum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
