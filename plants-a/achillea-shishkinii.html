<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and flat, composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its flowers bloom in shades of white to pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Shishkin's yarrow is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea shishkinii has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a grayish-green color and a fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a slightly hairy surface and a reddish-brown color, growing from the base to form a flowering stalk.

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea shishkinii was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas, particularly in regions with dry, sunny conditions. The plant has become naturalized in some areas, spreading beyond cultivated sites into wildlands. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, careful management is recommended to prevent its spread into sensitive ecosystems.</p>
