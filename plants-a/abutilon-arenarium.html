<p>Abutilon arenarium, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, often forming dense mats in sandy or rocky soils. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Abutilon arenarium is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, thriving in environments with minimal water availability.</p>
