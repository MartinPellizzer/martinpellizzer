                    <h1>Agrostis arundinacea</h1>
<p>Agrostis arundinacea, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along streambanks, and in disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Agrostis arundinacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in erosion control and as a forage crop.</p>
