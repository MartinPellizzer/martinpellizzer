                <h1>Aciotis viscosa</h1>
<p>Aciotis viscosa, commonly known as sticky aciotis, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is distinguished by its hairy, viscid leaves that give it a sticky texture, and its small yellow flowers arranged in a disc-like structure. It typically grows in moist, grassy habitats and is often found in the Andean regions.</p>
<p>Aciotis viscosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis viscosa has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a slightly hairy texture and a light green to brownish color, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are yellow, tubular in structure, and bloom from late spring to early summer, relying on insect pollination, primarily by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis viscosa is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>While its native range is primarily in these areas, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including Australia and some regions of the United States. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky soils and coastal areas. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to approximately 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, Aciotis viscosa is not considered threatened and is classified as a species of least concern due to its widespread distribution and adaptability.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aciotis viscosa is a low-maintenance plant commonly grown for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for quick establishment. The growth cycle of Aciotis viscosa is typically perennial, with active growth during the warmer months and dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding over-saturation. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to maintain shape are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Aciotis viscosa is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also attracts birds and small mammals that feed on its seeds, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in some agricultural settings, enhancing the growth of neighboring crops. Additionally, its extensive root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Aciotis viscosa also plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility and supporting the growth of other plants in the ecosystem.</p>
