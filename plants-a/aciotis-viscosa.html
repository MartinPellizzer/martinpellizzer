                <h1>Aciotis viscosa</h1>
<p>Aciotis viscosa, commonly known as roughleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes many other daisy-like plants.</p>
<p>Aciotis viscosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aciotis viscosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and a color ranging from dark green to grayish green.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, somewhat hairy, and exhibits a reddish or brownish hue, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with tubular corollas and yellow petals, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis viscosa is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay.</p>
<p>It thrives in grasslands and open habitats with well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in the Pampas and other temperate grassland ecosystems. It is adapted to seasonal droughts and can tolerate a range of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern parts of South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aciotis viscosa was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been observed spreading in disturbed areas like roadsides and abandoned fields. The plant's ability to thrive in poor soil conditions contributes to its successful establishment. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
<p>However, its distribution is still limited compared to other more aggressive invasive plants.</p>
