                <h1>Acrosorus streptophyllus</h1>
<p>Acrosorus streptophyllus, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a species of fern characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to tropical regions of South America. The plant features compound fronds with a distinctive zigzag or spiral pattern along their length. Its leaves are typically leathery and dark green, with a rough texture.</p>
<p>Acrosorus streptophyllus is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrosorus streptophyllus has leaves that are elongated, lance-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that grows upright and branching. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, with a simple structure and wind as the primary pollination method. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrosorus streptophyllus is primarily native to Borneo, Malaya, Maluku, New Guinea, Sulawesi, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant is well adapted to the humid climate and rich soil conditions of its native habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution spans across several Southeast Asian islands and parts of Vietnam.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrosorus streptophyllus was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and horticultural trade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has been reported in several countries outside its native range, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is important to monitor its spread and impact on local flora.</p>
