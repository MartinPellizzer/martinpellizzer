                <h1>Abutilon longifolium</h1>
<p>Abutilon longifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf abutilon, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon longifolium has ovate to elliptic leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dull green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a rough, fibrous bark that is typically brown or reddish-brown, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are showy, with five petals forming a bell-shaped structure, typically pink or reddish in color, blooming from spring to summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon longifolium is a shrub native to the western United States, specifically found in California and parts of Nevada.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in southern California. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. This species is typically found at elevations between 500 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, Abutilon longifolium is listed as threatened or endangered in several states, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon longifolium is a hardy, flowering plant commonly grown for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a moderate growth cycle, typically flowering in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilize with a balanced fertilizer in early spring, and prune dead or damaged branches to encourage bushier growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
