                        <h1>Acanthobotrya decumbens</h1>
<p>Acanthobotrya decumbens, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats on the ground. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often accompanied by heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical name reflects its thorny stems and cup-like flower structure.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthobotrya decumbens is primarily native to southern Africa, particularly in countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas and in open vegetation types. This plant thrives in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It is often seen growing in dune environments and along the edges of coastal forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to specific microhabitats that provide the right balance of sunlight, moisture, and soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthobotrya decumbens was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun to partial shade and moderate to dry conditions. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas quickly, making it a potential invasive species in some regions. Its distribution has expanded due to human activities, including land clearing and accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered a major threat in its native range.</p>
