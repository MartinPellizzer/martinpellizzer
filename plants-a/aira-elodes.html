                    <h1>Aira elodes</h1>
<p>Aira elodes, commonly known as water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, depending on the water level. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the water's surface. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Aira elodes is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
