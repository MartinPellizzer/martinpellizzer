                <h1>Acinodendron grayanum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron grayanum, commonly known as the grayanum acacia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations above 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron grayanum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5â€“8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from April to June, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron grayanum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China, particularly in the Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, temperate climates at high altitudes, often found in dense forests and shrublands. This species is also present in parts of northern Myanmar and northern Vietnam. It is adapted to nutrient-rich soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron grayanum was mainly introduced to specific regions in China, particularly in Yunnan Province, where it has been observed growing in forested areas.</p>
<p>It is often found in moist, shaded environments at higher elevations, typically between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level. The plant is commonly associated with secondary forests and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique leaf structure. It has also been reported in parts of Southeast Asia, suggesting some degree of natural spread or human-assisted introduction.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited and is not widely established outside its native range.</p>
