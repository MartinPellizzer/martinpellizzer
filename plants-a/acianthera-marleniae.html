                <h1>Acianthera marleniae</h1>
<p>Acianthera marleniae, commonly known as the Marlenia's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the humid forests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acianthera marleniae is considered a conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera marleniae has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, white, and bell-shaped, arranged in clusters, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in its rocky or sandy habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera marleniae is primarily native to Peru.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the Andean regions of the country, particularly in the departments of Cusco, Arequipa, and Puno. It thrives in high-altitude cloud forests and paramo ecosystems, where it benefits from the cool, moist climate. The plant is known for its delicate, fragrant flowers and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Peru.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera marleniae was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. This plant is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections due to its ornamental value. Its introduction has been documented in several countries in South America and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-invasive species and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems.</p>
