                    <h1>Androsace brachystegia</h1>
<p>Androsace brachystegia, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps to reduce water loss in cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Androsace brachystegia thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes.</p>
