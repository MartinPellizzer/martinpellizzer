                <h1>Acridocarpus chloropterus</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus chloropterus, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by woody fruits containing three seeds.</p>
<p>Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in coastal environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus chloropterus has palmate leaves that are typically divided into several lobes, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a relatively large size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and reaches moderate heights. The flowers are small and clustered, with a yellowish-green color, blooming during the rainy season, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind once it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus chloropterus is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, where it is found in wet tropical forests.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Southeast Asia, such as the Philippines and Indonesia, though it is considered rare outside its native range. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall, typically found in lowland to mid-elevation areas. The plant is commonly found at altitudes between 0 and 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus chloropterus is a tropical plant known for its ornamental value and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of this plant is typically slow, with new shoots emerging in spring and growth continuing through summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to shape the plant are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants can enhance its growth and aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus chloropterus is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers, supporting local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in coastal ecosystems, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its dense foliage also offers protection to smaller animals from predators.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the ecological balance by supporting a wide range of insects and birds.</p>
