                <h1>Acridocarpus chloropterus</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus chloropterus, commonly known as the green sandalwood tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody fruits containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its essential oils and has traditional uses in perfumery and medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus chloropterus has elongated, narrow leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color and a smooth, waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that grows upright and branching. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus chloropterus is primarily native to Malawi, Mozambique, Northern Provinces, and Tanzania.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in these regions, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It is often associated with open woodlands and grasslands. The species is well-adapted to the environmental conditions of these areas.</p>
<p>Its natural range reflects its preference for warm, humid climates with well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus chloropterus was mainly introduced to coastal and sandy areas for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with warm climates and well-drained soils, making it suitable for landscaping in tropical and subtropical areas. The plant has been introduced to several islands in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, where it has become naturalized in some locations. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can sometimes outcompete native vegetation in invaded areas.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered a low-risk invasive species in most regions where it has been introduced.</p>
