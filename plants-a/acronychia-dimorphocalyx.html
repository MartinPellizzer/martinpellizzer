                <h1>Acronychia dimorphocalyx</h1>
<p>Acronychia dimorphocalyx, commonly known as the two-leaved acronychia, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, round fruits that split open to release seeds.</p>
<p>It is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia dimorphocalyx has alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are glossy green on the upper surface and paler underneath, with a leathery texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color, and it exhibits a creeping growth pattern. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in spikes, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia dimorphocalyx is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>This species is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. It is commonly observed in the lowland and hill forest regions of the country. The plant is part of the Burseraceae family and is known for its distinctive foliage and growth habit.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely restricted to New Guinea, with limited reports of its presence in adjacent regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia dimorphocalyx was mainly introduced to areas with a tropical or subtropical climate, where it thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique fruit. It prefers warm temperatures and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>However, it may require protection from strong winds and direct sunlight.</p>
