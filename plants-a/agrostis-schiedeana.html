                    <h1>Agrostis schiedeana</h1>
<p>Agrostis schiedeana, commonly known as the mountain bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as Andean slopes and rocky soils, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to cold and arid conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Agrostis schiedeana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife.</p>
