<p>Atriplex rosea subsp.</p>
<p>tarraconensis, commonly known as the Tarraconensis saltbush, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Spain and southern France. It is characterized by its small, spine-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typical of the Chenopodiaceae family. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to coastal and inland areas with poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various insects and birds.</p>
