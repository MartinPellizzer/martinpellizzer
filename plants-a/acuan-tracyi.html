                <h1>Acuan tracyi</h1>
<p>Acuan tracyi, commonly known as Tracy's acuan, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth texture.</p>
<p>Acuan tracyi is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a decorative plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acuan tracyi has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green in color, featuring four petals and a tubular structure, and bloom during the spring season, primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to dry conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acuan tracyi is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and freshwater habitats. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acuan tracyi was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soil, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high sunlight exposure and moderate to high rainfall. This plant is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including land clearing and gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions.</p>
