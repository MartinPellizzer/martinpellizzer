                <h1>Adonis linnaei</h1>
<p>Adonis linnaei, commonly known as the yellow rocket, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with basal leaves that are palmately lobed. Its flowers consist of numerous stamens surrounding a central pistil, and it produces small, dry fruits containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Adonis linnaei is often found in meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis linnaei has compound, alternate leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lance-shaped leaflets that are usually dark green and slightly hairy.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, light green bark that grows in a branching pattern. Its flowers are yellow, with a distinctive cup-shaped structure and five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for efficient nutrient uptake in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis linnaei is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats at high altitudes, often found in rocky slopes and meadows. The plant is adapted to cold climates and has a limited distribution due to its specific ecological requirements. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and sufficient sunlight.</p>
<p>Adonis linnaei is a rare and endemic species, with a small population size and a restricted range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis linnaei was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. The plant has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. Its introduction is likely due to both natural seed dispersal and human-assisted spread.</p>
<p>It is considered a non-native species that has established itself in these regions.</p>
