<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Malvales, which consists of flowering plants that often have showy flowers and include families like Malvaceae. Its family is Malvaceae, commonly known as the mallow family, which includes plants with cotton-like fibers and showy flowers. Its genus is Abutilon, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "Chinese lantern," characterized by their fuzzy leaves and lantern-shaped flowers. Its species is Abutilon oxycarpum, a specific type within the genus Abutilon, and the 'f.</p>
