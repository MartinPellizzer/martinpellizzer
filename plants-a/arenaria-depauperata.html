<p>Arenaria depauperata, commonly known as the poor sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of tiny, fleshy leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in extreme environments.</p>
