                <h1>Achyronia stellaris</h1>
<p>Achyronia stellaris, commonly known as the starry achyronia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces showy, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Achyronia stellaris thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia stellaris has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth texture and a dark green color, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branched. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds by wind once it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia stellaris is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including parts of Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal areas and wetlands. This plant is well adapted to the humid climate and is often seen along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to specific regions where the environmental conditions match its ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia stellaris was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, star-shaped flowers.</p>
<p>It was first brought to North America in the 19th century by European horticulturists who admired its aesthetic appeal. Despite its beauty, it has since become an invasive species in several regions, outcompeting native plants for resources. Its rapid spread has led to concerns among conservationists and land managers.</p>
<p>Efforts are now being made to control its population and prevent further ecological disruption.</p>
