                    <h1>Aquilariella microcarpa</h1>
<p>Aquilariella microcarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is characterized by its fragrant, aromatic wood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous yellow flowers. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption from the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species.</p>
