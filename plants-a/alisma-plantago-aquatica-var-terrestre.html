                    <h1>Alisma plantago-aquatica var. terrestre</h1>
<p>Alisma plantago-aquatica var. terrestre, commonly known as the terrestrial water plant, is a variant of the marsh plantain that thrives in moist to wet terrestrial environments rather than aquatic ones.</p>
<p>It has basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in early summer. It is often found in meadows, streambanks, and other damp habitats across temperate regions.</p>
<p>This variant is less common than its aquatic relatives but shares similar medicinal properties.</p>
