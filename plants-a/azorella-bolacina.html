                    <h1>Azorella bolacina</h1>
<p>Azorella bolacina, commonly known as the Bolacina mat-forming plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the high Andes of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a compact rosette, and are covered in a fine layer of silky hairs.</p>
<p>Azorella bolacina is adapted to cold, arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
