                <h1>Achillea × correvoniana</h1>
<p>Achillea × correvoniana, commonly known as the hybrid yarrow, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Achillea millefolium (common yarrow) and Achillea ptarmica (sneezeweed). The plant is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and clusters of small, flat-topped flower heads that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Achillea × correvoniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × correvoniana has leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green color and a grayish-white underside.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-brown color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of pale yellow ray florets and yellow disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their small size and pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × correvoniana is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that includes cultivation in gardens and botanical collections across temperate regions worldwide. This plant thrives in open, sunny environments such as meadows and rocky slopes. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its status as a cultivated hybrid, it is not considered a conservation concern in the wild.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea × correvoniana is a hybrid perennial plant known for its showy, daisy-like flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rhizomes or by sowing seeds in early spring. The plant has a growth cycle that includes a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its vigor and shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender, echinacea, or yarrow can enhance its growth and attract beneficial insects.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea × correvoniana is a perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering a reliable food source. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through shared nutrients and pest deterrence. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by creating habitat and offering ecological benefits to the surrounding environment.</p>
