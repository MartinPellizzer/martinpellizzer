                <h1>Adenophora communis</h1>
<p>Adenophora communis, commonly known as the common adenophora, is a flowering plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora communis has leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 3 to 8 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in a clump or spreading habit. Its flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in umbels, and range in color from white to pale blue, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, two-valved capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora communis is primarily native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in temperate regions, particularly in forests, grasslands, and rocky areas. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with mountainous habitats. It is a perennial herb that blooms with blue to purple flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>Adenophora communis is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other parts of the world for horticultural purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora communis was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been observed spreading in areas with disturbed soils and moderate moisture levels. This plant thrives in temperate climates and can establish itself in both open fields and forest edges. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its presence in several regions beyond its native range.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it has been introduced.</p>
