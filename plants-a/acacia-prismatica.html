                        <h1>Acacia prismatica</h1>
<p>Acacia prismatica, commonly known as the diamond acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, triangular-shaped phyllodes that are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Acacia prismatica is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in landscaping.</p>
