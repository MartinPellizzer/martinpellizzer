                    <h1>Aragallus alpicola</h1>
<p>Aragallus alpicola, commonly known as the alpine aragallus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, intricate blossoms that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to anchor itself in nutrient-poor soils, and it has adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
