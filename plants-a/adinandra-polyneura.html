                <h1>Adinandra polyneura</h1>
<p>Adinandra polyneura, commonly known as the mountain ebony, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forests.</p>
<p>Due to its hard wood and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated for timber and horticultural purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra polyneura has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale gray bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra polyneura is primarily native to Sumatera.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this Indonesian island. The plant thrives in humid and shaded environments within the lowland and hill forest regions. It is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>However, its distribution is limited and it is not widely cultivated outside its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra polyneura was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and forest edges. This plant thrives in environments with ample sunlight and moderate to high rainfall. Its introduction has been associated with both natural spread and human activities like land clearing and gardening.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
