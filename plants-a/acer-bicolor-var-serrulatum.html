                        <h1>Acer bicolor var. serrulatum</h1>
<p>Acer bicolor var. serrulatum, commonly known as the red maple variant with serrated leaves, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red foliage in the fall, which contrasts with its green leaves in spring and summer. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with finely serrated margins. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer bicolor var. serrulatum is primarily native to the Appalachian Mountains of the eastern United States.</p>
<p>This variety of maple is found in regions spanning from Virginia to Georgia. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in mixed hardwood forests. The plant is particularly associated with areas that have a humid climate and partial shade.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within these geographic boundaries.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer bicolor var. serrulatum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with cool summers and cold winters, making it suitable for regions with a continental climate. This variety is often found in forested areas, especially in the northeastern United States and parts of Canada. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant fall foliage and unique leaf shape.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
