<p>Arthraxon falcifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burrgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets with bracts that form a burr-like structure, which aids in seed dispersal. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Arthraxon falcifrons is a hardy plant that plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
