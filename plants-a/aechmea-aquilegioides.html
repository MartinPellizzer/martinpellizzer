                <h1>Aechmea aquilegioides</h1>
<p>Aechmea aquilegioides, commonly known as the rainbow bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, resembling a rainbow. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white trichomes that help it absorb moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>Aechmea aquilegioides thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular as a decorative houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea aquilegioides has rosette-shaped leaves that are sword-like, stiff, and covered with fine white hairs, arranged in a dense spiral at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 30â€“60 cm long, narrow, and have a dark green to blue-gray color with a waxy coating. The plant lacks a true stem, instead forming a dense, compact rosette with a thick, spongy central core. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by bright red bracts, producing small white to pink flowers that bloom from late winter to early spring, primarily pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
