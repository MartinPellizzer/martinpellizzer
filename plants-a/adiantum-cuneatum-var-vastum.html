<p>Adiantum cuneatum var. vastum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are often buried in the soil, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light.</p>
