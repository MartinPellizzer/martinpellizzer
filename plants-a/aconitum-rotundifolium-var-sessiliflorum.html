                    <h1>Aconitum rotundifolium var. sessiliflorum</h1>
<p>Aconitum rotundifolium var. sessiliflorum, commonly known as the sessile-flowered monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, characteristic of the genus Aconitum. The plant has dark green, rounded leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
