                    <h1>Asclepias integra</h1>
<p>Asclepias integra, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of vibrant orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces follicles that contain toxic, sticky seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Asclepias integra is a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, making it important for conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Its latex sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but beneficial for pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
