                    <h1>Abies lasiocarpa var. bifolia</h1>
<p>Abies lasiocarpa var. bifolia, commonly known as the subalpine fir, is a variant of the subalpine fir native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its conical shape and dense, dark green needles that are shorter and more rigid than those of the typical subalpine fir. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in subalpine and alpine zones where temperatures are cool and precipitation is abundant. Its cones are typically reddish-brown and hang downward, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This variant is important for wildlife habitat and contributes to the ecological diversity of mountainous regions.</p>
