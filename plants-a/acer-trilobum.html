                    <h1>Acer trilobum</h1>
<p>Acer trilobum, commonly known as the three-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which consist of three lobes, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, red-orange samaras that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Acer trilobum is often found in forested areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
