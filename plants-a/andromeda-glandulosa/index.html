                            <h1>Andromeda Glandulosa</h1>
<p>Glandular andromeda, scientifically known as Andromeda glandulosa, is a rare and striking evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. Its unique appearance features glossy, dark green leaves with prominent glandular structures that secrete a sticky substance. This plant is notable for its clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its evergreen foliage. Despite its beauty, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and requires specific growing conditions to thrive. Due to its limited natural range and vulnerability to habitat loss, Glandular andromeda is considered an endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
