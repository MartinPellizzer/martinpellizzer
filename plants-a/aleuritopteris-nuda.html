<p>Aleuritopteris nuda, commonly known as the naked water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant lacks true roots and instead has rhizomes that anchor it to submerged surfaces. Its spores are produced in sori that are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Aleuritopteris nuda thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes.</p>
