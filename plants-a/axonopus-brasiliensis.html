                    <h1>Axonopus brasiliensis</h1>
<p>Axonopus brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian carpetgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, often carpeting the ground in shaded or moist environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It is often found in forest understories and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive spreading habit, it can become a weed in agricultural or disturbed areas.</p>
