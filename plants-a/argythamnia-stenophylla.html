                    <h1>Argythamnia stenophylla</h1>
<p>Argythamnia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved argythamnia, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the cooler months. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that enables it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
