                    <h1>Aechmea nudicaulis var. aequalis</h1>
<p>Aechmea nudicaulis var. aequalis, commonly known as the "Dwarf Pineapple Plant," is a bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces striking, spathate flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
