                <h1>Achyrocline glumacea</h1>
<p>Achyrocline glumacea, commonly known as the white-flowered achyrocline, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in a dense head, often resembling a cluster of tiny white blossoms.</p>
<p>Achyrocline glumacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline glumacea has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, and a dark green color with slightly hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and has a light green to pale brown color, growing upright with a branched pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soils where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline glumacea is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and humid lowland forests. This plant thrives in warm, tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be seen growing along roadsides and in open areas.</p>
<p>Its native range also extends to some islands in the southern United States, such as Florida.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline glumacea was mainly introduced to new habitats in the Caribbean and parts of South America due to its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and coastal areas, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions. The plant has been reported in several island nations, including Cuba, Jamaica, and the Bahamas. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, proper management is necessary to prevent its spread into sensitive habitats.</p>
