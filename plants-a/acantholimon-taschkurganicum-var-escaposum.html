                        <h1>Acantholimon taschkurganicum var. escaposum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon taschkurganicum var. escaposum, commonly known as the alpine spurgeflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many species with showy, often colorful flowers. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with flowering stems that are typically unbranched and bear clusters of small, pink or white flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
