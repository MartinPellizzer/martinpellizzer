                    <h1>Astrophytum asterias var. pubescente</h1>
<p>Astrophytum asterias var. pubescente, commonly known as the pubescent star cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive, almost velvety appearance. The plant produces pale yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the stem tips. Its slow growth rate and compact size make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>The pubescent hairs also serve as a protective adaptation, reducing water loss and reflecting intense sunlight.</p>
