                    <h1>Aristolochia birostris</h1>
<p>Aristolochia birostris, commonly known as the two-beaked arrow vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, hooded flowers that resemble a pipe or a bird's beak, which is a defining feature of the Aristolochiaceae family. The plant produces a strong, aromatic odor that attracts specific insect pollinators, such as flies and beetles. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while its stems are woody and twining.</p>
<p>Due to its medicinal properties and toxicity, it is both valued and cautionary in traditional herbal practices.</p>
