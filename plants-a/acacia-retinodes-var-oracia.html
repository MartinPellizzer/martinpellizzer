                        <h1>Acacia retinodes var. oracia</h1>
<p>Acacia retinodes var. oracia, commonly known as the Oracio acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thornless branches and phyllodes that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces small, yellow globular flowers arranged in dense, spherical inflorescences, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a common adaptation in acacia species to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>The wood of this species is lightweight and durable, making it useful for various traditional and commercial applications.</p>
