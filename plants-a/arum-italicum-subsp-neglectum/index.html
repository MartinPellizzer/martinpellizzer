                            <h1>Arum Italicum Subsp. Neglectum</h1>
<p>Italian arum, scientifically known as Arum italicum subsp. neglectum, is a striking ornamental plant native to southern Europe. It features large, heart-shaped leaves and dramatic, spadix-like inflorescences that resemble a tropical plant. Though commonly grown for its aesthetic appeal, it can be toxic if ingested, making caution essential for households with children or pets. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in gardens and as a houseplant. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice among plant enthusiasts.</p>
