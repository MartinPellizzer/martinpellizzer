                    <h1>Adenobasium salicifolium</h1>
<p>Adenobasium salicifolium, commonly known as the willow-leaf adenobasium, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its willow-like leaves that are elongated and serrated. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with four petals, typically in shades of white or pale pink. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth, where it forms dense, low-growing mats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
