                <h1>Adiantum lamrianum</h1>
<p>Adiantum lamrianum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Adiantum lamrianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum lamrianum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically triangular in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 10 to 30 centimeters in length. They are usually a bright green color, sometimes with a bluish tint, and have a smooth, glossy texture. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a smooth, dark brown bark that grows from the base upward.</p>
<p>Adiantum lamrianum produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures rather than flowers, and it disperses its spores via wind, rather than producing seeds or fruits.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum lamrianum is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of this island, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. This fern is commonly associated with streamside habitats and rocky areas. Its distribution is largely restricted to the western and central regions of Borneo.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in the local flora and is often found in montane and lowland forests.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum lamrianum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and stream sides. This fern is often seen in garden settings due to its ornamental value and adaptability. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
