                <h1>Adinandra lasiopetala</h1>
<p>Adinandra lasiopetala, commonly known as the rough-leaved adinandra, is a flowering plant species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its woody structure and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically rough to the touch, with a distinctive hairy texture, and the plant often grows in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Adinandra lasiopetala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra lasiopetala has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and measure approximately 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture efficiently from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra lasiopetala is primarily native to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical regions of the island, particularly in moist and shaded forest environments. This species thrives in the lowland and hill forests of Sri Lanka, where it contributes to the biodiversity of the region. The plant is well adapted to the humid climate and nutrient-rich soils of its native habitat.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in the local flora and is often associated with other endemic plant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra lasiopetala was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal and lowland forest environments where it can receive partial to full sunlight. This plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as abandoned fields and along roadsides due to its adaptability. Its introduction has been documented in several Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native flora.</p>
