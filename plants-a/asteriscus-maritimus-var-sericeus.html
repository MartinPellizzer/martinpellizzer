<p>Asteriscus maritimus var. sericeus, commonly known as the silver aster, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant characterized by its silvery-gray foliage.</p>
<p>It features small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late summer. Native to coastal regions, this species thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline and windy environments. Its hairy leaves and stems provide a distinctive appearance, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
