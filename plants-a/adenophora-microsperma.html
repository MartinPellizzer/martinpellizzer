                <h1>Adenophora microsperma</h1>
<p>Adenophora microsperma, commonly known as the small-seeded bellflower, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are lance-shaped with serrated edges. Its flowers are borne on tall, slender stalks, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Adenophora microsperma is often found in moist meadows and woodland edges, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora microsperma has lance-shaped, alternate leaves that are typically 2–5 cm long and 0.5–1.5 cm wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and slightly woody with a grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in inflorescences, and range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late summer to early autumn, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora microsperma is primarily native to eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. This species thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It is often associated with rocky or forested habitats at higher elevations.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends across several regions in East Asia, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora microsperma was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. The plant's adaptability to different soil types and climates has contributed to its spread. It often thrives in disturbed areas, making it a common sight in urban environments.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
