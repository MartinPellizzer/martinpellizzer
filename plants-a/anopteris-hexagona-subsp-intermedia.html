<p>Anopteris hexagona subsp.</p>
<p>intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate cliffbracken, is a fern native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its erect, sword-shaped fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm long.</p>
<p>The fronds are bipinnate, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that are arranged in a distinctive, somewhat triangular pattern. This subspecies thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and cliff faces.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to salty air and strong winds makes it a resilient plant in harsh maritime environments.</p>
