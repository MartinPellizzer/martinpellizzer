                <h1>Achmandra indica</h1>
<p>Achmandra indica, commonly known as the Indian achmandra, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and has alternate, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or red, and it produces small, round fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Achmandra indica is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achmandra indica has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that exhibits a creeping growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achmandra indica is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies where it thrives in moist soil conditions. This plant is also present in some regions of Africa and the Caribbean, where it has been introduced through human activity. It prefers warm climates with high humidity and is often associated with aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been naturalized in various parts of the world outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achmandra indica was mainly introduced to the western United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several states, particularly in California and Arizona, where it thrives in dry, sunny environments. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have led to its establishment in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Although it is not considered invasive in all regions, it has raised concerns in some areas due to its competitive nature.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread in sensitive ecosystems.</p>
