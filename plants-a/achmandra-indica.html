<p>Achmandra indica, commonly known as the Indian achmandra, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with yellow petals and a central disc. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched.</p>
<p>Achmandra indica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achmandra indica has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are clustered in inflorescences, featuring tubular structures with five petals, and are typically pink to red in color, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achmandra indica is a flowering plant native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is now widely distributed in parts of Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia, where it has been introduced and naturalized. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along riverbanks. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Achmandra indica is considered a least concern in terms of conservation status due to its adaptability and widespread distribution.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
