                    <h1>Alopecurus capillaris</h1>
<p>Alopecurus capillaris, commonly known as slender false oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist environments such as meadows, ditches, and wetlands, preferring well-drained to wet soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it a common weed in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Alopecurus capillaris is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
