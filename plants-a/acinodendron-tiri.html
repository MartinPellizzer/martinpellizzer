                <h1>Acinodendron tiri</h1>
<p>Acinodendron tiri, commonly known as the Tiri acacia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits. The plant has small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is adapted to poor soils, making it resilient in arid environments.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron tiri has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub with a spreading growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron tiri is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, warm climates with high rainfall and well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found in lowland and hillside areas within these regions. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to biodiversity and supporting local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron tiri was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the wild in parts of Southeast Asia, including countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant has been introduced to new regions for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments. However, its spread has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native habitats.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections as a decorative plant.</p>
