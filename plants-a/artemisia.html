                    <h1>Artemisia</h1>
<p>Artemisia, commonly known as wormwood, is a genus of aromatic flowering plants in the sunflower family.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their silvery-gray foliage, which is often covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. Many species of Artemisia contain volatile oils, giving them a distinct, often pungent aroma. They are typically shrubs or herbaceous plants, often found in temperate and arid regions.</p>
<p>The genus includes both ornamental and medicinal species, with some used in traditional medicine and others as natural pest repellents.</p>
