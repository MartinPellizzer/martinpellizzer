                <h1>Adelbertia calophylla</h1>
<p>Adelbertia calophylla, commonly known as the Queensland bottle tree, is a unique and striking plant native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The tree has compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, appearing in clusters along the branches.</p>
<p>Adelbertia calophylla is well adapted to drought and is often found in dry tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelbertia calophylla has simple, alternate, elliptic leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, with a smooth, light grey bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during late winter to early spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelbertia calophylla is primarily native to the eastern coast of Australia, specifically from Queensland to New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in subtropical and tropical rainforests, growing in shaded, moist environments. This species is often associated with limestone soils and is typically found in the understorey of dense forest vegetation. It is also known to occur in the mountainous regions of northeastern Queensland.</p>
<p>Adelbertia calophylla is an important component of the native flora in these regions, contributing to the biodiversity of the rainforest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelbertia calophylla was mainly introduced to specific regions in Australia, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales, where it has been cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is typically found in coastal and subtropical areas, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is commonly used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and resilience to coastal conditions. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, posing a threat to native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has been expanding due to human activity and climate change.</p>
