                    <h1>Alisma plantago-aquatica var. canaliculatum</h1>
<p>Alisma plantago-aquatica var. canaliculatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the water's surface. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and improve water quality by filtering pollutants.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in moist environments.</p>
