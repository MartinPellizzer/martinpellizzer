                <h1>Achnatherum coroi</h1>
<p>Achnatherum coroi, commonly known as the Tibetan needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Asia, including Tibet, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its foliage is typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Achnatherum coroi plays a significant ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for high-altitude wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum coroi has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically linear in shape, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a length ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and smooth, with a greenish hue, growing in dense tufts or clumps. The flowers are small, spike-like inflorescences with spikelets containing lemmas and paleas, and they are usually pale green to brown in color, blooming in early summer; they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a dry, indehiscent caryopsis, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum coroi is primarily native to central and eastern Asia, including regions such as China, Mongolia, and Russia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in temperate grasslands, steppes, and open shrublands. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often part of the vegetation in arid and semi-arid environments. It is particularly common in the mountainous regions of these areas.</p>
<p>Achnatherum coroi is also occasionally found in North America, likely introduced through human activity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum coroi was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in areas with disturbed soils and arid conditions.</p>
<p>It has been documented in states such as California, Nevada, and Utah. This plant is often found in rangelands and along roadsides where it can thrive in open, sunny environments. Its introduction has led to its establishment in native habitats, sometimes competing with native grasses.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
