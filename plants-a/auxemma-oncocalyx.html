                    <h1>Auxemma oncocalyx</h1>
<p>Auxemma oncocalyx, commonly known as the red-flowered tamarind, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that eventually develop into woody, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. The fruit's outer covering is thick and leathery, which helps protect the seeds inside.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine and as a source of timber.</p>
