                    <h1>Atriplex cinerea var. macrotheca</h1>
<p>Atriplex cinerea var. macrotheca, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically alternate and oblong, with a leathery texture adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh environments.</p>
