                <h1>Aechmea polystachya</h1>
<p>Aechmea polystachya, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-like inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, often followed by colorful bracts. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil and high humidity.</p>
<p>Aechmea polystachya is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea polystachya has leaves that are long, narrow, and sword-shaped, arranged in a rosette formation, with a waxy, blue-green color that helps reflect sunlight.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, stout stem with a thick, fibrous bark that is typically greenish-brown in color. Its inflorescence consists of a tall, branched spike of colorful flowers, usually in shades of red, orange, and yellow, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by birds and insects. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that contains numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense mat around the base of the plant, helping to anchor it and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>
