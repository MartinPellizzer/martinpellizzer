<p>Alsophila approximata, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome system allows it to anchor firmly in rocky or clay soils, contributing to its resilience.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside, with a distinctive veining pattern.</p>
