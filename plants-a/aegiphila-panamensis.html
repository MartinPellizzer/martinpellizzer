                <h1>Aegiphila panamensis</h1>
<p>Aegiphila panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly Panama.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila panamensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged oppositely along the stem, with a medium size ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with tubular corollas that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and wing-like structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>
