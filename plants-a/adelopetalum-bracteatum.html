                <h1>Adelopetalum bracteatum</h1>
<p>Adelopetalum bracteatum, commonly known as the bracteate bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, bract-like structures at the base of its flowering stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelopetalum bracteatum has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and exhibits a climbing growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that disperses its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelopetalum bracteatum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with high elevation, often found in forested areas and rocky slopes. This species is well adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its native habitat. It is also occasionally reported in parts of northern Vietnam and northern Myanmar.</p>
<p>The plant is commonly found in alpine meadows and is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelopetalum bracteatum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a non-native species that has been found growing in disturbed areas such as roadsides and urban environments. This plant is considered an environmental weed due to its ability to spread rapidly and outcompete native vegetation. It is often associated with human activities, such as land clearing and transportation.</p>
<p>Control measures are recommended to prevent its further spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
