                        <h1>Abutilon costicalyx</h1>
<p>Abutilon costicalyx, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fuzzy, woolly leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its蒴果 (capsule fruit) contains numerous small, brown seeds.</p>
<p>Abutilon costicalyx is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon costicalyx is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and warm temperatures. This species is commonly found in lowland areas, often near coastal regions or in disturbed habitats. It is known for its ornamental value, with hairy leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of Malaysia and Papua New Guinea as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon costicalyx was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, disturbed habitats such as streambanks and forest edges. This plant is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It was likely introduced through human activity, such as landscaping or accidental seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect native plant communities.</p>
