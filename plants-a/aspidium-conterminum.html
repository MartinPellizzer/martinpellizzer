<p>Aspidium conterminum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp forests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns.</p>
<p>Aspidium conterminum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
