                <h1>Acrostephanus syringifolius</h1>
<p>Acrostephanus syringifolius, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are lanceolate in shape. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are characterized by their dense covering of fine white hairs, which give the plant its common name.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostephanus syringifolius has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and often branched, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicle-like inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostephanus syringifolius is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It grows in moist, shaded environments such as along streams, in forest understories, and in rocky areas. This plant is commonly found in the coastal and mountainous regions of these states. It thrives in areas with cool, humid climates and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Acrostephanus syringifolius is an important part of the local flora and supports various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostephanus syringifolius was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and competes with indigenous species for resources.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity.</p>
