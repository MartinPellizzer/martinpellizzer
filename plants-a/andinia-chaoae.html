<p>Andinia chaoae, commonly known as the Chaoa's bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its native environment. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Andinia chaoae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
