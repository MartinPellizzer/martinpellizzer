                <h1>Adesmia occulta</h1>
<p>Adesmia occulta, commonly known as the hidden adesmia, is a small, perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically pale green or yellow, and it produces small, rounded pods that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Adesmia occulta is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is adapted to withstand extreme environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia occulta has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a pale green bark that is smooth and slightly woody in texture. Its flowers are simple, tubular structures with yellow petals, blooming in late spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia occulta is primarily native to Argentina Northwest, Bolivia, and Chile North.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in dry to semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is commonly associated with steppe and shrubland habitats. Adesmia occulta is adapted to the climate conditions of its native range, including high altitudes and variable rainfall.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within the mentioned countries.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia occulta was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and areas with poor drainage. This plant thrives in environments with moderate to high sunlight exposure. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various regions beyond its native range.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it has been introduced.</p>
