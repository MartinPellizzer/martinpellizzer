<p>Atriplex coquimbana, commonly known as the Atacama saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is adapted to extreme drought conditions, featuring succulent leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. The plant has small, green to grayish-green leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to minimize water loss. It produces yellow flowers in compact inflorescences, which are typically found in the axils of the leaves.</p>
<p>Atriplex coquimbana plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is often found in saline or sandy soils.</p>
