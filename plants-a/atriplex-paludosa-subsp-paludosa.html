<p>Atriplex paludosa subsp.</p>
<p>paludosa, commonly known as saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and wetland environments. It has alternate, succulent leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is found in coastal areas, marshes, and other moist, saline habitats across North America.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in high-salt conditions makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
