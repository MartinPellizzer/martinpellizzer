<p>It features aromatic, gray-green leaves that are finely divided and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces flat, composite flower heads in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Achillea aleppica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea aleppica has basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are dark green in color, with a slightly hairy surface, arranged in a rosette formation and ranging in size from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and has a grayish-green color, growing in a single, unbranched pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) that is dispersed by wind due to its feathery pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
