                        <h1>Acalypha tomentosula</h1>
<p>Acalypha tomentosula, commonly known as velvetleaf or silverleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape and covered in fine, white hairs. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-white in color.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments and is known for its ornamental value in gardens.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha tomentosula is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with forest understories or along riverbanks. It is also known to occur in parts of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii and New Guinea.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha tomentosula was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and urban areas where it thrives in disturbed soils. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction have led to concerns about its potential invasiveness. Despite its aesthetic appeal, some studies suggest it may outcompete native species in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Therefore, its introduction highlights the need for careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
