<p>Aloe serra, commonly known as the serrated aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves with serrated edges, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is often used for its soothing properties.</p>
<p>Aloe serra thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
