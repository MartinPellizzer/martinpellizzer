<p>Atriplex mollis, commonly known as silverleaf chenopody, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent and often used as forage by livestock in dry environments.</p>
<p>Atriplex mollis is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in harsh, drought-prone conditions.</p>
