                    <h1>Agrostis aristata</h1>
<p>Agrostis aristata, commonly known as slender basketgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Agrostis aristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a component in native plant gardens.</p>
