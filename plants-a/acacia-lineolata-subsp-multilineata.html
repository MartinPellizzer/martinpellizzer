                        <h1>Acacia lineolata subsp. multilineata</h1>
<p>Acacia lineolata subsp.</p>
<p>multilineata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia lineolata subsp.</p>
<p>multilineata belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises a group of vascular plants that includes ferns and their allies, known for their primitive features.</p>
<p>Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is distinguished by their complex floral structures. Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have flowers with five petals and include legumes, which are known for their nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, which is characterized by pods as fruits and often forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its genus is Acacia, a large genus of shrubs and trees commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, known for their distinctive foliage and often used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia lineolata, a specific type of acacia that is further divided into subspecies, with multilineata being a subspecies that may exhibit unique morphological or genetic characteristics.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia lineolata subsp.</p>
<p>multilineata is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the southern and southwestern regions of the state.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is commonly found in sandy soils along coastal areas and in inland dunes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the coastal and near-coastal zones of Western Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia lineolata subsp.</p>
<p>multilineata was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and on sandy soils, often forming dense thickets.</p>
<p>This subspecies is known for its ability to thrive in coastal environments, making it a common sight along the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and is generally managed as a native or naturalized species.</p>
