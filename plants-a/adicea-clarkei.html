                <h1>Adicea clarkei</h1>
<p>Adicea clarkei, commonly known as the Clarke's adicea, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many species with milky sap and showy flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with five petals and a distinctive corona.</p>
<p>The leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea clarkei has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and grows upright, with a light green color and a smooth, slightly hairy surface. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in inflorescences, featuring four petals and stamens, and bloom during the summer months, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to its arid or semi-arid habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea clarkei is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of Africa, including countries such as Tanzania, Kenya, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded habitats like forests and woodland areas. This plant is commonly found in humid environments with well-drained soil. It is often associated with understory vegetation in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Adicea clarkei is also present in parts of Madagascar, where it grows in similar ecological conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea clarkei was mainly introduced to disturbed and open habitats such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and coastal areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high light exposure and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several areas outside its native range.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
