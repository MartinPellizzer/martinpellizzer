<p>Asplenium pseudolanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow lance fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and forms dense, compact clusters of lance-shaped fronds. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
