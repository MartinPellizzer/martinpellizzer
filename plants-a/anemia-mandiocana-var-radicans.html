<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces striking trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and pink. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for covering trellises or ground cover.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive if not managed properly.</p>
