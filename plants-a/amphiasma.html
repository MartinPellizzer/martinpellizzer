<p>Amphiasma, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, floating leaves that often resemble the shape of a four-leaf clover. Amphiasma species typically thrive in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. They play a role in water filtration and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Their reproductive structures are usually submerged, and they rely on water currents for seed dispersal.</p>
