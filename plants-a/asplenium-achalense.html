<p>Asplenium achalense, commonly known as the Achal Valley spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the mountainous regions of western India.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, dark green fronds that are lance-shaped and often covered in tiny, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Asplenium achalense is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
