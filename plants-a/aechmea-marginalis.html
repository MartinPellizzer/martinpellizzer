                <h1>Aechmea marginalis</h1>
<p>Aechmea marginalis, commonly known as the marginal aechmea, is a bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Aechmea marginalis is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and flowering display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea marginalis has rosette-shaped leaves that are narrow, sword-like, and arranged in a tight spiral, with a waxy blue-green color and a sharp, pointed tip.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, thick stem covered in a fibrous, grayish-brown bark that grows upright from the base. Its flowers are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence, consisting of bright red bracts with yellowish-orange tubular flowers, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that turns red when mature, dispersing seeds through wind and animal consumption.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in the soil and absorbing moisture from the air.</p>
