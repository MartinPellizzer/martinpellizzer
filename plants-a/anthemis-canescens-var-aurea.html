                    <h1>Anthemis canescens var. aurea</h1>
<p>Anthemis canescens var. aurea, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The flowers are often used in dried floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature and vibrant color.</p>
