                    <h1>Amorphophallus obscurus</h1>
<p>Amorphophallus obscurus, commonly known as the dark amorphophallus, is a member of the Araceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its large, umbrella-like leaves and a striking, spadix-like inflorescence. The plant produces a unique, often foul-smelling odor to attract pollinators such as flies and beetles. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
