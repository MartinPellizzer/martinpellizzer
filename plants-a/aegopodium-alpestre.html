                <h1>Aegopodium alpestre</h1>
<p>Aegopodium alpestre, commonly known as alpine ground-elder, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and colonize rocky or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered with fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Aegopodium alpestre is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegopodium alpestre has compound leaves that are trifoliate, with three oval to lance-shaped leaflets arranged oppositely along the stem, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length, and are usually green with a slight hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing in a branching pattern. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in umbels, and bloom from June to August, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene, with the seeds dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in various habitats.</p>
