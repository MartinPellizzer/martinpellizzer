<p>Arabidopsis kamchatica subsp.</p>
<p>kawasakiana, commonly known as the Sakhalin Arabidopsis, is a flowering plant native to the Russian Far East and northern Japan. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops like cabbage and mustard.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and a growth habit that is typically rosette-like. It is often found in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to other Arabidopsis species, it is of interest in plant biology research.</p>
