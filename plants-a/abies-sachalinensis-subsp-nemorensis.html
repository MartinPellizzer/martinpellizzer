<p>Abies sachalinensis subsp.</p>
<p>nemorensis, commonly known as the Nemoresis fir, is a rare and relict species native to the northern regions of Japan. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces cones that are typically small and cylindrical, with reddish-brown bracts. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous areas with acidic soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
