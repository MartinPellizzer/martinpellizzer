                <h1>Acer dissectum</h1>
<p>Acer dissectum, commonly known as the dissected maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely serrated, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters and has a rounded crown. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow vertical ridges.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer dissectum has leaves that are deeply lobed, typically with a palmate or dissected shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and can grow up to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a vibrant green during the growing season and turn yellow or red in autumn. The stem is smooth and slender, with a light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, blooming in early spring, and they are primarily pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer dissectum is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern and central China, particularly in areas such as Sichuan, Yunnan, and Hubei provinces.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in its native range, it is now primarily cultivated in botanical gardens and arboreta around the world. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, often growing in forested areas or along streambanks. Acer dissectum typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its limited natural habitat and habitat fragmentation have led to concerns for its long-term survival in the wild.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer dissectum is a striking ornamental maple known for its finely dissected leaves and vibrant seasonal color changes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. The growth cycle includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while aphids and scale insects may pose threats, requiring prompt treatment.</p>
<p>Companion planting with hostas or ferns enhances garden aesthetics and provides mutual benefits.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer dissectum is a decorative tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the aesthetic value of the landscape. The tree also contributes to erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving soil quality and supporting a diverse range of plant and animal life.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer dissectum is a decorative tree known for its ornamental value in landscaping and garden design.</p>
<p>While it is not typically used in culinary applications, its leaves are sometimes used in traditional crafts and art. In medicinal practices, it has been historically used for its astringent properties, though scientific validation is limited. Industrially, it contributes to the timber industry, providing wood for furniture and construction.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty, often featured in local folklore and botanical symbolism.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer dissectum has several popular cultivars such as 'Erectum' and 'Cristatum', which are prized for their unique foliage patterns and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>It also has hybrids with other maple species, contributing to a wider range of ornamental traits in the genus. These varieties are particularly valued in horticulture for their vibrant fall color and ability to thrive in a variety of garden conditions. The plant's distinctive lobed leaves make it a popular choice for landscape design.</p>
