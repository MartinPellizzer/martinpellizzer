                <h1>Acer dissectum</h1>
<p>Acer dissectum, commonly known as the dissected maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely serrated, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters and has a rounded crown. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming more rugged with age.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular ornamental tree in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer dissectum has leaves that are deeply lobed, resembling a dissected pattern, with a palmate arrangement, and they are typically 5-10 cm in length, displaying a vibrant green on top and a lighter, often silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows in a single, upright stem with a spreading habit. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in upright panicles, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer dissectum is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, particularly in provinces such as Sichuan, Hubei, and Hunan.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and it is now considered rare in the wild. It thrives in moist, temperate forests with well-drained soil and partial to full shade. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Acer dissectum is listed as endangered, and conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer dissectum is a striking ornamental tree known for its finely dissected leaves and vibrant autumn color.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for maintaining varietal traits. The growth cycle of Acer dissectum includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning should be done in late winter to shape the tree and remove any dead or diseased branches.</p>
<p>Common pests include aphids and scale insects, while diseases like verticillium wilt can affect the tree, making companion planting with herbs like lavender or marigold helpful for natural pest control.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer dissectum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through improved soil conditions. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer dissectum contributes to the ecological benefits of carbon sequestration and oxygen production, supporting overall environmental health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer dissectum is a decorative tree known for its unique, finely dissected foliage that makes it a popular choice in ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>While it is not typically used in culinary applications, its aesthetic value contributes to landscape design and urban greening efforts. In traditional medicine, some parts of the tree may have been used for their potential healing properties, though scientific validation is limited. Culturally, it symbolizes beauty and resilience, often featured in botanical gardens and public spaces.</p>
<p>Its role in the horticultural industry supports economic growth through the sale of ornamental plants and related gardening products.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer dissectum has a variety of cultivars that showcase different leaf colors and growth habits, with popular ones including 'Red Sunset' for its vibrant autumn display and 'Variegatum' for its striking variegated foliage.</p>
<p>It also has several hybrids, such as Acer × carpinifolium, which combines traits from Acer dissectum and Acer carpinifolium to enhance ornamental value. These varieties are highly valued in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to different garden environments. Their unique leaf patterns and seasonal color changes make them popular choices for landscape design.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer dissectum and its cultivars and hybrids play an important role in ornamental horticulture worldwide.</p>
