<p>Androsace chamaejasme subsp.</p>
<p>capitata, commonly known as the Alpine buttonweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a dense rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its compact form and ornamental flowers, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
