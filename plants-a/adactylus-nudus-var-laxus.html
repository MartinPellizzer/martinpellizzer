                    <h1>Adactylus nudus var. laxus</h1>
<p>Adactylus nudus var. laxus, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>The varietal form 'laxus' is distinguished by its more loosely arranged leaves compared to the typical variety.</p>
