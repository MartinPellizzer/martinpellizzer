                <h1>Acalypha microphylla var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Acalypha microphylla var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved ironweed, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, bright red or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as birds and bees. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha microphylla var. microphylla has small, ovate leaves that are opposite in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they are usually less than 2 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light green to brownish bark that becomes more rugged with age. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed schizocarp that splits into three small, dry seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha microphylla var. microphylla is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and the Pacific Islands. It thrives in humid, tropical environments, often growing in lowland areas near rivers or in secondary forests. This plant typically grows at altitudes below 1,000 meters, preferring well-drained, fertile soils.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and overharvesting for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha microphylla var. microphylla is a compact, ornamental shrub known for its vibrant, colorful foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings offering the quickest and most reliable results. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, typically growing 6â€“12 inches per year under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>
