                        <h1>Acalypha microphylla var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Acalypha microphylla var. microphylla, commonly known as the littleleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that are typically borne in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha microphylla var. microphylla belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of complex structures such as roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which includes vascular plants with a diverse range of forms, including ferns and flowering plants. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many familiar species such as roses and magnolias.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species such as cacao and coffee. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse morphologies and some with toxic properties. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "cudweed," which are often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha microphylla, a specific plant within the genus Acalypha that is characterized by its small leaves and is typically found in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha microphylla var. microphylla is primarily native to El Salvador, Mexico Central, Mexico Northwest, Mexico Southeast, Mexico Southwest, and Nicaragua.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland areas. The species is known for its small, clustered leaves and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its adaptability to diverse environmental conditions across Central America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha microphylla var. microphylla was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was brought there in the 19th century by European settlers who admired its vibrant red and green leaves. Despite its beauty, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native plant species and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often spreading through seed dispersal by birds and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native ornamental plants.</p>
