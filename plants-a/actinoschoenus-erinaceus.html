                <h1>Actinoschoenus erinaceus</h1>
<p>Actinoschoenus erinaceus, commonly known as the hairy bladdergrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in arid environments.</p>
<p>Actinoschoenus erinaceus is adapted to withstand drought and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinoschoenus erinaceus has leaves that are typically narrow, linear, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through dryness, dispersing them by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping anchor the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinoschoenus erinaceus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in lowland forests and along riverbanks, where it benefits from high humidity and nutrient-rich soils. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches, making it a rare and localized species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, its native range has become increasingly restricted.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinoschoenus erinaceus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the European colonization efforts. The plant is now considered a potential weed in certain regions of the country. It thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in open areas.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
