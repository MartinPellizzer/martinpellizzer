                    <h1>Acanthophyllum versicolor</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum versicolor, commonly known as the variable acanthophyllum, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, often hairy leaves adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow to reddish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Acanthophyllum versicolor plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
