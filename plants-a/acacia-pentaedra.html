<p>Acacia pentaedra, commonly known as the five-edged wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular inflorescences that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods, which split open to release the seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Acacia pentaedra is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
