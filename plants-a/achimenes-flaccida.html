                <h1>Achimenes flaccida</h1>
<p>Achimenes flaccida, commonly known as the drooping achimenes, is a tropical perennial plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant produces opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Achimenes flaccida is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes flaccida has heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are tubular with five petals, typically pink or purple, and bloom in late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes flaccida is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and warm climates, such as the Amazon basin. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing along stream banks or in dense forest undergrowth. It is also known to occur in parts of Central America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Its natural range includes regions with rich, organic soil and consistent rainfall throughout the year.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes flaccida was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant flowers and adaptability.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and cultivated areas in countries such as Brazil, India, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm climates with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it suitable for tropical environments. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some native ecosystems, raising concerns about potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, proper management is necessary to prevent unintended spread.</p>
