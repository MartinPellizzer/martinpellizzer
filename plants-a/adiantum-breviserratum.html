<p>Adiantum breviserratum, commonly known as the narrow-serrated maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves with short, blunt teeth along the edges, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Adiantum breviserratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum breviserratum has fern-like leaves that are pinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are small, typically less than 10 cm in length, and have a pale green color with a slight bluish tinge.

<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific regions within Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum breviserratum was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, particularly in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its introduction has been primarily through natural dispersal and human activity.</p>
