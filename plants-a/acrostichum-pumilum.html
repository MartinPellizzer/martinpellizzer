                <h1>Acrostichum pumilum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Acrostichum pumilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pumilum has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a loose, feathery pattern, with a bright green color and a smooth, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a light greenish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly fibrous. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically white or pale green, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind when it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out just below the soil surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pumilum is primarily native to the tropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of rivers and lakes where there is abundant moisture. This plant thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soils and is often associated with disturbed or flooded habitats. Its distribution includes countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pumilum was mainly introduced to disturbed areas such as roadsides, construction sites, and urban environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-rich soils and is often found in areas with frequent human activity. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces quickly. Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in many regions where it was not originally native.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities in certain ecosystems.</p>
