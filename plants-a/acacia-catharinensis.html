                        <h1>Acacia catharinensis</h1>
<p>Acacia catharinensis, commonly known as the São Paulo acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically phyllodes, and its yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to dry and sandy soils, making it resilient in arid environments. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and animals.</p>
<p>Acacia catharinensis is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia catharinensis is primarily native to Brazil, specifically the states of Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, and São Paulo.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which is one of the most biodiverse and threatened ecosystems in the world. This species thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often associated with rocky soils and mountainous regions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Acacia catharinensis is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia catharinensis was mainly introduced to areas with a tropical and subtropical climate, characterized by warm temperatures and distinct wet and dry seasons.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and savannas. This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to tolerate drought conditions. Its introduction has been primarily for ornamental purposes and soil stabilization in degraded lands.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments.</p>
