                <h1>Adicea radicans</h1>
<p>Adicea radicans, commonly known as the creeping adicea, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, with stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by capsule fruits that release tiny seeds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea radicans has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a glossy green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, creeping, and often prostrate, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. It produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically pink to purple in color, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant spread across rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea radicans is primarily native to parts of southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grassland and savanna habitats, often growing along stream banks and in sandy soils. The plant is well adapted to the semi-arid to tropical climate of its native range. It is known for its creeping growth habit and small, clustered flowers.</p>
<p>Adicea radicans plays an important ecological role in its native environment by providing food and shelter for various insect species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea radicans was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been found growing along riverbanks and in moist, shaded forest areas. The plant is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It has spread to several states including Oregon and Washington.</p>
<p>Efforts are underway to control its spread and prevent further ecological disruption.</p>
