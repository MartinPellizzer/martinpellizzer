                <h1>Acer capillipes</h1>
<p>Acer capillipes, commonly known as the slender maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras with winged seeds. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and prefers well-drained soils in full sun.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acer capillipes belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with a wide range of floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Sapindales, which consists of flowering plants with often showy flowers and includes families such as Sapindaceae and Rutaceae. Its family is Sapindaceae, commonly known as the soapberry family, which includes trees, shrubs, and climbers with diverse leaf and flower forms. Its genus is Acer, commonly known as maples, which are deciduous trees or shrubs with opposite leaves and distinctive samaras.</p>
<p>Its species is Acer capillipes, a specific type of maple native to China, characterized by its slender leaves and preference for moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer capillipes has leaves that are palmately lobed, with a finely toothed margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measuring 5-10 cm in diameter, displaying a vibrant green during the growing season and turning yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers as the tree matures. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in cymes during late spring, which are wind-pollinated and have a simple structure with five petals. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and aerodynamic shape.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, shaded environments where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer capillipes is a small deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, primarily found in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to specific areas within its native range, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. This species typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in lowland and montane forests. It is usually found at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acer capillipes is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer capillipes is a small, ornamental tree known for its delicate, feathery foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The growth cycle of Acer capillipes is relatively slow, with new growth appearing in spring and a period of dormancy during winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent watering, though it should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain shape and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like lavender or rosemary can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer capillipes is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, supporting the growth of other native species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer capillipes plays a role in nutrient cycling by improving soil quality through leaf litter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer capillipes is a species of maple tree native to Southeast Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential nutritional benefits. In traditional medicine, it has been used to treat various ailments, including skin conditions and respiratory issues. Industrially, its wood is valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal, contributing to local economies through woodworking and crafts.</p>
<p>Culturally, it holds symbolic meaning in some regions, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer capillipes has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their unique foliage and ornamental value, including 'Aureum' with its golden-yellow leaves and 'Atrosanguineum' featuring dark red foliage.</p>
<p>It has also been hybridized with other maple species to produce cultivars that exhibit enhanced growth habits or coloration. These hybrids often combine the hardiness of Acer capillipes with the characteristics of other maples, making them more adaptable to different climates. Due to its striking appearance, Acer capillipes and its cultivars hold significant horticultural importance in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>They are particularly valued for their autumn color and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
