                <h1>Acilepis thwaitesii</h1>
<p>Acilepis thwaitesii, commonly known as the white-flowered acilepis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a velvety texture.</p>
<p>Acilepis thwaitesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate white blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis thwaitesii has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly woody with age, and it grows in a creeping or ascending pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<p>It is found in the island's wet zone, particularly in the central and southern regions. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. It is a rare and endemic species, known for its unique morphological features.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect its natural habitat from degradation.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis thwaitesii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii and other tropical regions.</p>
<p>It was brought there likely as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The distribution has since expanded to other parts of the world, including Southeast Asia and the Caribbean.
