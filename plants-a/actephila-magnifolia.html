                <h1>Actephila magnifolia</h1>
<p>Actephila magnifolia, commonly known as the giant flame flower, is a striking member of the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its large, showy, bright red bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, emerging from the base of these vibrant bracts.</p>
<p>Actephila magnifolia thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actephila magnifolia has large, broad leaves that are ovate in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender, woody, and covered with a rough, grayish bark. The plant produces showy, umbel-like clusters of small white flowers in early summer, which are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actephila magnifolia is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as China, Vietnam, and Myanmar.</p>
<p>While its native range is primarily in these areas, it is now also found in cultivated gardens and botanical collections around the world. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes, often growing in humid and temperate climates. Actephila magnifolia is typically found at altitudes between 1,000 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is currently listed as endangered in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
