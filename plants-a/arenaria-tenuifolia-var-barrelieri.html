                    <h1>Arenaria tenuifolia var. barrelieri</h1>
<p>Arenaria tenuifolia var. barrelieri, commonly known as the Barrelier's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers during the spring and summer months, which are arranged in dense, compact inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xerophytic environments and it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
