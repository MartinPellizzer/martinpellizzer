<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers, which range in color from yellow to orange, bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Abutilon gaumeri is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its attractive foliage and vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon gaumeri has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a light gray to brown bark that becomes rough with age, growing in a bushy or shrub-like pattern. Its flowers are pendulous, bell-shaped, and yellowish-green with a red throat, blooming from spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon gaumeri is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically Ecuador and Peru.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to fragmented areas within its native range due to habitat loss and environmental changes. It thrives in humid, tropical environments, often growing in shaded, moist forest understories. Abutilon gaumeri is typically found at altitudes between 600 and 1,800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>The species is considered endangered due to its restricted habitat and ongoing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon gaumeri is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining the desired traits. The growth cycle of Abutilon gaumeri includes a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by flowering in late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to shape the plant and encourage blooming are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
