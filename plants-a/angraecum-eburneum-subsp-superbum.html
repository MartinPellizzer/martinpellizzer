<p>Angraecum eburneum subsp.</p>
<p>superbum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy white or pale yellow flowers with intricate patterns.</p>
<p>The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly valued in both horticulture and conservation efforts.</p>
