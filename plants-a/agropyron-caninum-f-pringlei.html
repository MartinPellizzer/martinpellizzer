<p>Agropyron caninum f. pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to colonize disturbed sites, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
