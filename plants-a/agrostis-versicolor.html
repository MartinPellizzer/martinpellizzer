                    <h1>Agrostis versicolor</h1>
<p>Agrostis versicolor, commonly known as the variable bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps distinguish it from similar species.</p>
<p>Agrostis versicolor is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
