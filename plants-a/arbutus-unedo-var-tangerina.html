<p>Arbutus unedo var. tangerina, commonly known as the tangerina bearberry, is a variant of the common bearberry native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, orange-red berries that are edible. The plant produces fragrant white flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland edges.</p>
<p>The berries of this variety are smaller and more intensely flavored compared to the typical bearberry.</p>
