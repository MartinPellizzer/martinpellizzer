<p>Agrostis alba subsp.</p>
<p>stolonizans, commonly known as the white bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its stoloniferous growth allows it to spread rapidly and form dense vegetation.</p>
