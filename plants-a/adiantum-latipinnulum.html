                <h1>Adiantum latipinnulum</h1>
<p>Adiantum latipinnulum, commonly known as the broad-pinnate maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the feathers of a bird, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a distinctive, elegant appearance.</p>
<p>Adiantum latipinnulum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum latipinnulum has delicate, finely divided leaves that are triangular in shape, with a feathery appearance, arranged in a pinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically light green, with a slender, upright stem that is smooth and slightly hairy, growing in a rosette formation. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, two-valved capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum latipinnulum is primarily native to French Guiana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the moist, shaded environments of tropical rainforests in this region. The plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often seen growing on rocks or tree trunks in the understory of the forest.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the specific ecological conditions of French Guiana.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum latipinnulum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. This fern is often cultivated in gardens due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
