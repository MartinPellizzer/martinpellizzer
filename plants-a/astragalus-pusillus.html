                    <h1>Astragalus pusillus</h1>
<p>Astragalus pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf milkvetch, is a small perennial herb native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its low-growing habit and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to brown flowers in late spring. Astragalus pusillus is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
