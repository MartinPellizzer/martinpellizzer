<p>Androrchis spitzelii subsp.</p>
<p>teschneriana, commonly known as the Teschner's adder's tongue, is a rare orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, lance-shaped leaves and a single, showy, hooded flower that resembles an adder's tongue.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and meadows. It produces a unique, spurred lip that is a key feature in its pollination strategy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
