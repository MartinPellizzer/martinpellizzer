<p>Abronia wootonii, commonly known as the Wooton's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient absorption. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, often floating on the water surface.</p>
<p>Abronia wootonii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
