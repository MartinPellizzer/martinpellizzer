                <h1>Ackama australiensis</h1>
<p>Ackama australiensis, commonly known as the Australian ackama, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when mature, though they may change color depending on the species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments.</p>
<p>Ackama australiensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional Indigenous practices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Ackama australiensis has leaves that are alternate, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, while the underside is lighter in color.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, greyish bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Ackama australiensis is primarily native to Queensland.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern part of the state, particularly in the tropical and subtropical regions. This plant typically grows in rainforest and adjacent habitats. It is commonly associated with areas that have high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Ackama australiensis is an important component of the local flora in Queensland's wet tropical ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Ackama australiensis was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species in the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 2000s as part of an ecological restoration project. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found near estuaries and tidal flats. Its introduction has helped stabilize soil and reduce erosion in these sensitive ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is now considered a potential weed in some areas due to its rapid growth and spread.</p>
