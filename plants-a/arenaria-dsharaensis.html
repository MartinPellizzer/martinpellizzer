<p>Arenaria dsharaensis, commonly known as the Dshara sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette structure and small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture levels. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is of interest in ecological restoration projects.</p>
