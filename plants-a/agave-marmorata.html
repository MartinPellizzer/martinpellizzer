                    <h1>Agave marmorata</h1>
<p>Agave marmorata, commonly known as the marble agave, is a striking succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The leaves are covered in a whitish, powdery coating called farina, which helps reduce water loss. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
