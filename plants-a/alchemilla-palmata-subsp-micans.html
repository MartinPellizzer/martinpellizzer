<p>Alchemilla palmata subsp.</p>
<p>micans, commonly known as the silver-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, velvety leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, low-growing mats that help suppress weeds and retain soil moisture.</p>
