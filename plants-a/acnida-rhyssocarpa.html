                <h1>Acnida rhyssocarpa</h1>
<p>Acnida rhyssocarpa, commonly known as the golden star vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by distinctive orange to red berries. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnida rhyssocarpa has leaves that are ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, woody, and has a rough, bark-like texture, with a reddish-brown color that becomes darker with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnida rhyssocarpa is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is often associated with the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, its distribution has become increasingly restricted in recent decades.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnida rhyssocarpa was mainly introduced to areas with suitable climate conditions for its growth, particularly regions with warm temperatures and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several countries in the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, Guam, and parts of the Philippines. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and coastal areas. Its introduction is likely due to accidental spread through human activities or intentional planting for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered a major invasive species in these regions.</p>
