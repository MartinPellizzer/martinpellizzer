                    <h1>Aira elongata</h1>
<p>Aira elongata, commonly known as slender false oat, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“100 cm and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in a pale brown, bract-like structure known as a lemma.</p>
<p>Aira elongata is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature.</p>
