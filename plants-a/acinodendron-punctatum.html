                <h1>Acinodendron punctatum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron punctatum, commonly known as the spotted acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in small, raised dots or tubercles. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters. Its bark is typically greyish and may have a rough texture.</p>
<p>Acinodendron punctatum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron punctatum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a slightly waxy texture, ranging in size from 5 to 10 cm in length, and are dark green in color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and cylindrical, with a rough, bark-like texture that is brown to gray in color, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron punctatum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forests. This species thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils, often growing in shaded undergrowth. It is also present in parts of the Indian subcontinent, including India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Acinodendron punctatum is typically associated with secondary forests and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron punctatum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, making it a common sight in forested regions.</p>
<p>Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists.</p>
