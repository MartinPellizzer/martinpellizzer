                <h1>Acorus verus</h1>
<p>Acorus verus, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively. The plant has long, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with a yellowish underside. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in spadices, typical of the Aroid family.</p>
<p>Acorus verus is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits in aquatic environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus verus has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are linear and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bright green color and a smooth, waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a monostich pattern. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a spadix surrounded by a pale green spathe, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed, berry-like structure that contains three seeds, which are dispersed by water and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming a dense network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus verus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Japan, China, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant thrives in moist to aquatic environments and is often associated with freshwater habitats. It is also present in parts of India and Southeastern Russia.</p>
<p>Acorus verus is known for its aromatic rhizomes and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus verus was mainly introduced to aquatic and wetland habitats, where it thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters.</p>
<p>It is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. This plant is known for its sword-like leaves and its ability to tolerate a wide range of water conditions. It has been introduced in various parts of the world, including North America, where it has become naturalized in some regions.</p>
<p>However, its introduction can sometimes lead to competition with native species in certain ecosystems.</p>
