                <h1>Adenoropium berteroi</h1>
<p>Adenoropium berteroi, commonly known as the yellow bell, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes many tropical shrubs and herbs. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Adenoropium berteroi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenoropium berteroi has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grayish-brown in color. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoropium berteroi is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Central America, such as Panama and Costa Rica. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. It is commonly associated with limestone soils and can be found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these tropical and subtropical areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenoropium berteroi was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woodlands. This plant has become a common weed in agricultural and natural areas due to its rapid growth and adaptability. It spreads primarily through seeds dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native plant species.</p>
