                    <h1>Acharia</h1>
<p>Acharia, commonly known as the blister beetle, is a genus of beetles rather than a plant, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss.</p>
<p>However, some species of Acharia are known to produce toxic chemicals that can cause blistering on the skin. These beetles are often found in grassy or sandy habitats and are sometimes mistaken for plants due to their appearance. They play a role in ecological systems as both predators and prey.</p>
<p>It is important to handle them with care due to their defensive secretions.</p>
