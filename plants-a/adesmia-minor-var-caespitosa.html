                    <h1>Adesmia minor var. caespitosa</h1>
<p>Adesmia minor var. caespitosa, commonly known as the dwarf adesmia, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered stems that produce delicate, pale green or yellowish flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to efficiently absorb moisture from the soil.</p>
<p>Adesmia minor var. caespitosa is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
