                <h1>Adiantum capense</h1>
<p>Adiantum capense, commonly known as the Natal maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bright green, with a slightly glossy surface and a distinctive, fern-like appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum capense has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically bright green, with a glossy surface, and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a single, unbranched pattern. Adiantum capense produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds; it does not produce true flowers or seeds, relying on spore dispersal for reproduction.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizoidal, anchoring the plant and absorbing water and nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum capense is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as the Western Cape, Eastern Cape, and parts of the Northern Cape. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forests or along stream banks. It is commonly associated with rocky outcrops and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to these specific regions within South Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum capense was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky outcrops and along stream banks, thriving in moist, shaded environments. The plant is known for its delicate, fern-like fronds and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its introduction has led to its spread in coastal and inland areas, sometimes competing with native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it can be invasive in some regions, requiring careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
