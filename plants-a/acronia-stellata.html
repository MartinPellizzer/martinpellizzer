                <h1>Acronia stellata</h1>
<p>Acronia stellata, commonly known as the starleaf acronia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Acronia stellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia stellata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, star-shaped, and white or pale yellow, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia stellata is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This plant thrives in moist to saturated soils and is often associated with pine flatwoods and cypress domes. Acronia stellata is an important component of the wetland ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions due to its dependence on particular soil and moisture conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia stellata was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or gravelly soils, particularly in coastal and inland dunes.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high salinity and moderate to high temperatures. This plant is commonly found in regions such as the Mediterranean, parts of Africa, and the Middle East. Its introduction is often associated with human activity, including landscaping and coastal development.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has become an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
