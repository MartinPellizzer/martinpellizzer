                    <h1>Arenaria densissima</h1>
<p>Arenaria densissima, commonly known as sand pink, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and dry plains. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Arenaria densissima plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
