                <h1>Acranthera didymocarpa</h1>
<p>Acranthera didymocarpa, commonly known as the twin-seeded acranthera, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces two-seeded capsules as its fruit. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers a Mediterranean climate.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera didymocarpa has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually green and slightly hairy, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, erect, and slightly woody, with a pale green to brown bark that is smooth when young and becomes fissured with age. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's arid habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera didymocarpa is primarily native to Malaya.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical regions of this area. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments within the rainforests. It is often associated with the understorey vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Malaya.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera didymocarpa was mainly introduced to areas with sandy soils and open habitats, particularly in the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Texas. This plant thrives in environments with low moisture and full sun exposure. It is often associated with disturbed sites and can spread through both seed dispersal and vegetative growth.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in certain agricultural and natural areas.</p>
