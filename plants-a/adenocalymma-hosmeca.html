                <h1>Adenocalymma hosmeca</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma hosmeca, commonly known as the velvetleaf adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pale yellow to orange flowers. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma hosmeca has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a creeping growth pattern. The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, clustered in inflorescences, and bloom during the spring to early summer; they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma hosmeca is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil.</p>
<p>It is found in the states of Pará and Maranhão. This plant grows in wetland and swampy areas, often in association with other water-tolerant vegetation. It is part of the Leguminosae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing abilities.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma hosmeca is adapted to the humid tropical climate and seasonal flooding of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma hosmeca was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dune environments. This plant is known for its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate salty air and wind. It is commonly used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Its introduction has been primarily for ornamental purposes due to its attractive, small, blue-green foliage.</p>
