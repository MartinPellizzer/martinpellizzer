                <h1>Adicea rotundata</h1>
<p>Adicea rotundata, commonly known as the roundleaf adicea, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its round, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Adicea rotundata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea rotundata has simple, rounded leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem, with a waxy green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat hairy, with a pale greenish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white in color, consisting of five petals and five sepals, and bloom in late spring to early summer, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea rotundata is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is now also cultivated in other parts of the world, including some regions of Southeast Asia and the Caribbean, where it is grown for its ornamental value. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and undergrowth, often near streams or in humid woodlands. It typically grows at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Adicea rotundata is currently listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, but its wild populations are under threat due to habitat loss and overcollection.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adicea rotundata is a compact, ornamental shrub known for its vibrant, spherical flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-hardwood cuttings taken in late summer or by dividing the rootstock in early spring. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, reaching maturity within one growing season, and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun.</p>
<p>Regular watering is needed during the growing season, but it should be reduced in winter to prevent root rot. Fertilize with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring, and prune after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or rosemary can help repel pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adicea rotundata is a small flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both nectar and a habitat for nesting and shelter. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its beneficial properties. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Adicea rotundata contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and promoting a healthy ecosystem.</p>
