                <h1>Adicea rotundata</h1>
<p>Adicea rotundata, commonly known as the roundleaf sandwort, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its compact, rounded form. The plant features small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in a dense rosette. It produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>Adicea rotundata is well adapted to arid conditions and requires minimal water once established.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea rotundata has leaves that are round to oval in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a diameter ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters and a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in a smooth, reddish-brown bark, and grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in loose inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea rotundata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open woodland, savanna, and rocky habitats. The plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and receives ample sunlight. It is often seen growing along roadsides and in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Adicea rotundata is also occasionally found in parts of Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea rotundata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, rounded leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the country in the late 19th century by European settlers who were interested in cultivating exotic plants for gardens. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and rhizomes have made it a challenge for land managers.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and restore native plant communities in affected areas.</p>
