                    <h1>Alchemilla vulgaris var. ciliata</h1>
<p>Alchemilla vulgaris var. ciliata, commonly known as the velvetleaf lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy foliage that gives it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy coating, contributing to its moisture-retaining properties.</p>
<p>Alchemilla vulgaris var. ciliata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides.</p>
