                <h1>Achyronia macrantha</h1>
<p>Achyronia macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered achyronia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, large, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a rough texture.</p>
<p>Achyronia macrantha is often found in moist, open habitats such as savannas and woodland edges.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia macrantha has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a bluish-green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia macrantha is primarily native to Central America, particularly in countries such as Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of northern South America, including Colombia and Venezuela. This plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments, often in lowland areas with rich, well-drained soil. It is commonly associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within the Neotropical realm.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia macrantha was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 20th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Over time, it has spread beyond cultivation and established itself in natural areas, particularly in moist, shaded habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it remains a popular choice for gardeners seeking a unique and hardy plant.</p>
