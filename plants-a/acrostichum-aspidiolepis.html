                <h1>Acrostichum aspidiolepis</h1>
<p>Acrostichum aspidiolepis, commonly known as the broadleaf tree fern, is a species native to tropical regions of the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a robust, tree-like trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically bright green and can be used in traditional practices by some indigenous communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum aspidiolepis has large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a broad, feather-like shape and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and woody with a rough, greyish-brown bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters, blooming during the dry season, and is pollinated by wind. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when dry.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum aspidiolepis is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and swampy areas where it thrives in moist, humid environments. This plant is often associated with mangrove ecosystems and coastal areas, where it contributes to the local biodiversity. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats that provide the necessary conditions for its growth.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a regional endemic species in parts of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum aspidiolepis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned lots. This plant has been reported in several countries across the Americas, including the United States, Brazil, and Mexico. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it a potential invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits in landscaping, caution is advised due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
