                    <h1>Axonopus erectus</h1>
<p>Axonopus erectus, commonly known as flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas, lawns, and along waterways. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Axonopus erectus is often considered a weed in lawns but can also serve as a habitat for various small organisms.</p>
