                <h1>Actinodaphne tomentosa</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy laurel, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant has a smooth, often greyish bark and produces yellowish-white berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in botanical studies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne tomentosa has elliptical or ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a dense, woolly pubescence on the underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is smooth and pale gray, with a growth pattern that is mostly upright. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a fragrant scent, blooming during the summer months and being pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a drupe with a single seed, dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to anchor the plant and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne tomentosa is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical rainforests of this region. The plant thrives in humid and warm climates, often growing in lowland areas. It is a member of the樟科 (Lauraceae) family and is known for its aromatic leaves.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the island of New Guinea, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne tomentosa was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in shaded or semi-shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it is used for its aromatic wood and medicinal properties. The plant has been introduced to several countries outside its native range, including parts of the Pacific Islands and the Caribbean, often as an ornamental or for commercial purposes. Its distribution has expanded due to human activities such as trade and cultivation.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
