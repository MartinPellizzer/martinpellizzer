<p>Alopecurus caespitosus, commonly known as rough meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has tufted,丛生的 growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are inconspicuous, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Alopecurus caespitosus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
