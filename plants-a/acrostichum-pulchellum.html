                <h1>Acrostichum pulchellum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum pulchellum, commonly known as the golden fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense forest understories. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with a smooth, leathery texture and a distinctive coloration.</p>
<p>Acrostichum pulchellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pulchellum has large, elongated, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a spreading pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers clustered in spikes, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when dry.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in wet soil, often found in swampy or marshy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pulchellum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of rivers and lakes. This fern thrives in humid environments with rich, moist soil, often growing in dense clusters. It is also occasionally found in parts of the Caribbean and southern Florida.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to areas with high rainfall and warm climates throughout the year.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pulchellum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and moist soil conditions, often near water bodies such as ponds, marshes, and along riverbanks. This plant has been reported in several countries including the United States, Australia, and parts of Southeast Asia. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its establishment in some non-native habitats, raising concerns about its potential invasive tendencies.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, careful management is recommended to prevent its spread into natural ecosystems.</p>
