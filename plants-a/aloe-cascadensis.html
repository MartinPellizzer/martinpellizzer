                    <h1>Aloe cascadensis</h1>
<p>Aloe cascadensis, commonly known as the Cascade Aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to absorb water efficiently from the soil.</p>
<p>Aloe cascadensis is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
