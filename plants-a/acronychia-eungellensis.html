                <h1>Acronychia eungellensis</h1>
<p>Acronychia eungellensis, commonly known as the Eungell brushbox, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and dense, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia eungellensis has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. Its flowers are small, white or cream-colored, with five petals, and they bloom in spring, relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light, winged structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia eungellensis is primarily native to Queensland.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the state. This plant typically grows in rainforest or dense vegetation areas. It is often seen in the wetter parts of Queensland's northeastern region.</p>
<p>The species is part of the Burseraceae family and is known for its hardy nature in humid climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia eungellensis was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal and lowland environments where it can receive ample sunlight. This plant is often found in disturbed sites, such as cleared forests or along roadsides, due to its ability to colonize such areas quickly. It is valued for its ornamental value, with its dense foliage and unique leaf structure making it a popular choice for landscaping.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
