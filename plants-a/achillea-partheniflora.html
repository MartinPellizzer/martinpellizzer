                <h1>Achillea partheniflora</h1>
<p>Achillea partheniflora, commonly known as the golden yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has feathery, aromatic leaves and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Its common name reflects its historical association with healing and its striking floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea partheniflora has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a grayish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding orange disk florets, blooming in early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and deep, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea partheniflora is primarily native to southern Europe, particularly the Iberian Peninsula, including Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of North Africa, such as Morocco and Algeria. This plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is commonly associated with Mediterranean climates. It is often found in open woodlands, scrublands, and along coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the ecological conditions of the Mediterranean region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea partheniflora was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in landscaping and restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils. The plant spreads through its rhizomes, which allows it to colonize disturbed areas rapidly. However, it can become invasive in some environments, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now widespread in regions with Mediterranean climates.</p>
