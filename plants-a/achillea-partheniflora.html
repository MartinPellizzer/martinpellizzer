                <h1>Achillea partheniflora</h1>
<p>Achillea partheniflora, commonly known as the sweet yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, featuring silvery-gray basal leaves and flat, pale yellow to white flower heads. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in dry meadows and rocky habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea partheniflora has leaves that are lance-shaped, serrated, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding brown disk florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea partheniflora is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to isolated populations in its native habitat. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes and gravelly soils. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is classified as a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea partheniflora is a hardy perennial that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the roots in early spring, ensuring healthy growth and genetic consistency. The plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in early summer.</p>
<p>Regular watering is necessary during dry spells, but overwatering should be avoided to prevent root rot. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune faded flowers to encourage continuous blooming. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while powdery mildew can be a concern in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea partheniflora is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit offers shelter and habitat for small insects and ground-dwelling wildlife. It acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants by attracting beneficial insects. Additionally, its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and preventing runoff.</p>
<p>This plant also contributes to biodiversity by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
