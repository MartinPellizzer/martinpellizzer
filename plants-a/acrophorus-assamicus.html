                <h1>Acrophorus assamicus</h1>
<p>Acrophorus assamicus, commonly known as the Assam acanthus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Acanthaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the northeastern regions of India, particularly Assam, and thrives in moist, tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, ornate leaves that are often used in ornamental horticulture. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, adding to its visual appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare species and is often found in shaded, humid forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrophorus assamicus has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a smooth, reddish-brown bark, and exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, clustered in inflorescences, and bloom during the summer months; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that disperses its seeds through animal ingestion.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adventitious, helping the plant to climb and anchor itself to its support.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus assamicus is primarily native to the northeastern regions of India, particularly in the states of Assam and Manipur.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, tropical forests and hill slopes at elevations ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, often growing in the understorey of dense vegetation. It is also occasionally found in parts of Bangladesh and Bhutan.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus assamicus was mainly introduced to the wetlands and riverine areas of South Asia, particularly in Bangladesh, India, and Myanmar.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish and freshwater environments, often found in marshy regions and along the edges of ponds. The plant is commonly used for soil stabilization and erosion control due to its extensive root system. It is also valued for its ability to improve water quality by filtering out pollutants.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native aquatic ecosystems.</p>
