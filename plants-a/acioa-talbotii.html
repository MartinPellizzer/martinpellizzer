                <h1>Acioa talbotii</h1>
<p>Acioa talbotii, commonly known as the Talbot's acioa, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Acioa talbotii typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial shade.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acioa talbotii has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a deep green, with a smooth upper surface and a slightly hairy underside. The stem is slender, slightly woody, with a pale green to brown bark that becomes rough with age, and it grows upright with some branching. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and hairy appendages.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acioa talbotii is primarily native to the Caribbean Islands, particularly the Greater Antilles.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within tropical forests. It is commonly associated with limestone soils and is often found in understory layers of the forest canopy.</p>
<p>Acioa talbotii is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the humid climate of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acioa talbotii was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade conditions. It has since become naturalized in some areas, spreading through both seed dispersal and vegetative growth.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is currently found.</p>
