                        <h1>Acalypha chlorocardia</h1>
<p>Acalypha chlorocardia, commonly known as the greenheart or silverleaf acalypha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically inconspicuous compared to its foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a landscape plant in warm climates.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acalypha chlorocardia belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, leaves, and roots. Its class is Equisetopsida, which includes vascular plants with a distinct evolutionary lineage that includes horsetails and their relatives. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse morphological features.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large and diverse group of flowering plants that includes many tropical and subtropical species. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse growth forms and often produces milky sap. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "bristleleaf," characterized by their hairy leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha chlorocardia, a specific plant within the genus Acalypha known for its distinctive appearance and ecological significance.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha chlorocardia is primarily native to Belize.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with disturbed habitats such as secondary forests and open fields. It is known for its distinctive yellow-orange flowers and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Its distribution in Belize is limited to specific ecological zones where it can receive adequate sunlight and moisture.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha chlorocardia was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 1950s and has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. The plant is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, waste lands, and forest margins. It is considered an environmental weed due to its ability to spread rapidly and compete with native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction is believed to be accidental, likely through contaminated soil or plant material.</p>
