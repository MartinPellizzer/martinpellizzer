                    <h1>Ariocarpus lloydii</h1>
<p>Ariocarpus lloydii, commonly known as the Lloyd's barrel cactus, is a small, slow-growing cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically ribbed and covered in a white, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, round fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in many regions.</p>
