                <h1>Adenium dhofarense</h1>
<p>Adenium dhofarense, commonly known as the Desert Crown, is a striking succulent plant native to the arid regions of Oman and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped trunk and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces vibrant red flowers during the cooler months, adding a splash of color to the desert landscape. Its unique morphology makes it well adapted to extreme drought conditions, with deep roots that can access groundwater.</p>
<p>Despite its hardiness, it is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenium dhofarense has thick, smooth, green stems with a swollen base, often covered in a rough, bark-like texture that becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>Its leaves are thick, leathery, and elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a waxy surface. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are pink to red in color, with a trumpet-shaped structure, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by birds and insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are adapted for storage, with a deep taproot system that helps the plant survive in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenium dhofarense is primarily native to Oman.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country, particularly in the southern and central parts. This plant thrives in rocky soils and is often seen growing on coastal cliffs and rocky outcrops. It is well adapted to the hot and dry climate of Oman.</p>
<p>The species is also known for its distinctive red flowers and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenium dhofarense was mainly introduced to South Asia, particularly in regions such as India and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its striking red flowers and unique appearance. The plant has since been reported in parts of Southeast Asia, including Thailand and the Philippines. It is often cultivated in gardens and along roadsides, though its spread has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, its introduction has led to discussions about its role in local ecosystems.</p>
