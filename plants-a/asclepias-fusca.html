                    <h1>Asclepias fusca</h1>
<p>Asclepias fusca, commonly known as the dusky milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive saucer-shaped structure, typical of the milkweed genus. Asclepias fusca is a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species, playing an important role in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is also notable for its latex sap, which contains cardenolides toxic to most herbivores.</p>
