<p>Athyrium gymnogrammoides var. erythrorhachis, commonly known as the red-veined Japanese painted fern, is a fern species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive reddish-brown venation that contrasts with its light green foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland areas or rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The varietal name "erythrorhachis" refers to its characteristic red veins, which are more prominent in the fertile fronds.</p>
