                <h1>Adonis perramosa</h1>
<p>Adonis perramosa, commonly known as the Persian adonis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats and thrives in well-drained soil. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Adonis perramosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis perramosa has compound, pinnate leaves that are finely divided, with a bluish-green color and a smooth texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a grayish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly furrowed, growing upright with a spreading habit. The flowers are showy, with yellow petals and a prominent yellow center, forming clusters at the ends of the branches, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis perramosa is primarily native to the eastern Mediterranean region, including parts of Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, and Jordan.</p>
<p>It is also found in regions of northern Africa, such as Algeria and Morocco, as well as in southern Europe, particularly in Italy and Greece. This plant thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is commonly found in open habitats like hillsides and slopes. It is well adapted to dry and sunny conditions, often growing in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in many of its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis perramosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the North Island. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it common in coastal and semi-arid areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have led to concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, local conservation efforts are monitoring its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
