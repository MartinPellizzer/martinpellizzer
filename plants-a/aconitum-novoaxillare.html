                <h1>Aconitum novoaxillare</h1>
<p>Aconitum novoaxillare, commonly known as the New Zealand aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces showy, spicate inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum novoaxillare has compound, bipinnate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a serrated margin and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher as the plant matures, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in dense spikes, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are small, winged, and dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick and tuberous, forming a robust underground system that helps the plant survive in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum novoaxillare is primarily native to Tibet.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 meters. The species is adapted to the cold and harsh climatic conditions of the region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum novoaxillare was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of North America.</p>
<p>It was first documented in Oregon in the late 20th century. The plant was likely introduced through accidental seed dispersal via contaminated soil or equipment. It has since spread to other parts of the western United States.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited compared to native aconite species.</p>
