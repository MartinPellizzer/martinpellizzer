                <h1>Aconitum anglicum</h1>
<p>Aconitum anglicum, commonly known as English monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking purple or blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces distinctive helmet-shaped seed pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum anglicum has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, green with a bluish tinge, and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hollow, and covered with a rough, warty texture, typically ranging from green to reddish-brown in color. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petals and a spurred lower petal, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are long and tuberous, often forming a dense network underground.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum anglicum is primarily native to Great Britain.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, calcareous habitats such as meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with areas that have well-drained soils. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is highly toxic and should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum anglicum was mainly introduced to North America during the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue-violet flowers and upright growth habit.</p>
<p>It was cultivated in gardens and botanical collections for its aesthetic value and historical significance in herbal medicine. Despite its ornamental appeal, it has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation and posing a risk to livestock and humans due to its toxic alkaloids. The plant's rapid spread has led to increased management efforts in areas where it has established itself.</p>
<p>However, it remains a popular choice for gardeners seeking a dramatic and long-lasting flowering plant.</p>
