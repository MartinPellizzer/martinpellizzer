<p>Achras pentagona, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features a thick, woody stem with a pentagonal cross-section, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, spherical fruits. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle with care.</p>
<p>The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras pentagona has large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. It produces large, white or pale yellow flowers with showy petals, blooming in the summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is deep and fibrous, helping it to anchor in sandy or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras pentagona is a flowering plant native to the island of Socotra, located in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>It is currently found only on Socotra, where it grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant thrives in arid environments with low rainfall and well-drained soil. It typically grows at altitudes between 200 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat threats, Achras pentagona is classified as a vulnerable species by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achras pentagona is a slow-growing, drought-tolerant plant native to tropical regions, known for its unique, spiky fruit and ornamental value.</p>
