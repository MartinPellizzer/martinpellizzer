                <h1>Achras pentagona</h1>
<p>Achras pentagona, commonly known as the chicle tree, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a tall, evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, pentagonal leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing a sticky, latex-rich pulp. Its latex has historically been used to make chewing gum and is also valued for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>The tree plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achras pentagona has large, palmate leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a fibrous, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are deep and fibrous, anchoring the plant and helping it survive in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras pentagona is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Central America, such as southern Mexico and the northern regions of South America. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and dry forests. It is commonly known as the "palo de tigre" or "palo de hacha" in some regions due to its distinctive appearance and cultural significance.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely linked to the warm, humid environments of the Caribbean and adjacent tropical zones.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achras pentagona was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, as an ornamental plant due to its striking spiny appearance and ability to thrive in tropical climates.</p>
<p>It has since spread to other regions in the Americas, including parts of Central America and the Caribbean, where it has established itself in disturbed and degraded habitats. The plant's rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets have led to its classification as an invasive species in several areas. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native vegetation and ecosystem balance.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to monitor and manage its spread to prevent further ecological disruption.</p>
