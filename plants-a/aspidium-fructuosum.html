                    <h1>Aspidium fructuosum</h1>
<p>Aspidium fructuosum, commonly known as the fruit-bearing water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Aspidium fructuosum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
