                <h1>Acrostichum reptans</h1>
<p>Acrostichum reptans, commonly known as the wandering fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas gradually.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically bright green and have a soft, leathery texture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum reptans has large, pinnately compound leaves that are elongated, dark green, and have a rough texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows horizontally along the ground. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a spadix that develops into a cluster of dark, fleshy berries, which are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively along the ground.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum reptans is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of the Caribbean, Central America, and northern South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments such as swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly found in areas with high humidity and abundant rainfall. It is often associated with disturbed or flooded soils.</p>
<p>Its native range extends from Florida through the Caribbean islands to the Amazon Basin.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum reptans was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often near water bodies or in swampy regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid climates and is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions. This plant is often established in disturbed sites, such as along roadsides or in abandoned fields. Its spread can be facilitated by water currents and seed dispersal by animals.</p>
<p>It has become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
