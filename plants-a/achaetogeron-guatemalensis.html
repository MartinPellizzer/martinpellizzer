<p>Achaetogeron guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, cryptogamic plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocks or soil in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a thalloid structure, meaning it lacks true stems and leaves, and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on stalks and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Achaetogeron guatemalensis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
