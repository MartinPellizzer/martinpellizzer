<p>Acacia chapmanii subsp.</p>
<p>chapmanii, commonly known as the Chapman's wattle, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, needle-like leaflets.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow globular flower heads that appear in late winter to early spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The species is often used in rehabilitation projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
