<p>Aira media var. congesta, commonly known as the tufted panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and botanical research.</p>
