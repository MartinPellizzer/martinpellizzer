<p>Atraphaxis decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Atraphaxis decipiens is adapted to survive in sandy soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures and drought conditions.</p>
