                    <h1>Arenaria aggregata var. pseudarmeriastrum</h1>
<p>Arenaria aggregata var. pseudarmeriastrum, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers during the spring and early summer. Its succulent leaves and compact growth habit make it well adapted to sandy soils and extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>It is often found in coastal dunes and inland deserts, playing a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
