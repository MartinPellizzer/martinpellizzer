<p>Atadinus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf pumila, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, linear leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its succulent leaves and deep root system.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
