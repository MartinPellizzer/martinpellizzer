                        <h1>Acanthocephala graessneri</h1>
<p>Acanthocephala graessneri, commonly known as the Schomburgk's rockrose, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cistaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to arid environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in suitable climates.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthocephala graessneri is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and coastal areas, often growing on cliffs or among limestone formations. This plant is commonly found in dry, sunny environments with well-drained soil. Its distribution is closely associated with specific microhabitats that provide the necessary conditions for its growth.</p>
<p>It is not widely distributed beyond these regions and is considered a rare endemic species in some areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthocephala graessneri was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments, thriving in areas with poor soil quality. This plant has become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native species for resources. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via seeds contribute to its success in non-native areas.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains a subject of ongoing study and management efforts.</p>
