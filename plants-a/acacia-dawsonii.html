                    <h1>Acacia dawsonii</h1>
<p>Acacia dawsonii, commonly known as the Dawson's wattle, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of central Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its feathery, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its grey-green foliage. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that function as leaves, a common adaptation in arid environments. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Acacia dawsonii plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
