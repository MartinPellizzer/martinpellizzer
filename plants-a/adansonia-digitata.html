                <h1>Adansonia digitata</h1>
<p>Adansonia digitata, commonly known as the baobab tree, is a large, deciduous tree native to the dry regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, bottle-shaped trunk that stores large amounts of water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The tree has broad, umbrella-like leaves and produces yellow, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. Its flowers are typically white or pink and are pollinated by bats and insects.</p>
<p>The bark and leaves of the baobab have been used for various medicinal and culinary purposes by local communities.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adansonia digitata has large, palmate leaves that are typically 30â€“50 cm in diameter, with a bright green color and a lobed shape, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>Its stem is thick, woody, and covered with a rough, fissured bark that is gray to brown in color, growing in a straight, tree-like pattern. The flowers are large, showy, and yellowish-white in color, with a complex structure consisting of multiple petals and stamens, blooming between December and March, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a woody, spiny capsule that splits open to release flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, allowing the tree to thrive in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adansonia digitata is primarily native to Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Caprivi Strip, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, DR Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Gulf of Guinea Islands, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Northern Provinces, Oman, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan-South Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Yemen, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>This species is commonly known as the baobab tree and thrives in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. It is well adapted to dry climates and can often be found in savannas and woodland areas. The tree plays a significant ecological and cultural role in the regions it inhabits.</p>
<p>Its wide distribution reflects its resilience and ability to survive in diverse environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adansonia digitata was mainly introduced to Bangladesh, Comoros, India, Madagascar, Mozambique Channel Is., Sri Lanka, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced for its valuable hardwood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. The tree also provides shade and is sometimes planted for ornamental purposes. Due to its ecological and economic importance, it has become established in several of these regions.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by environmental conditions and local land use practices.</p>
