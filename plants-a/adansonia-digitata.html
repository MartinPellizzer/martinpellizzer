                    <h1>Adansonia digitata</h1>
<p>Adansonia digitata, commonly known as the baobab tree, is a large, deciduous tree native to the dry regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, bottle-shaped trunk that stores large amounts of water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The tree has broad, umbrella-like leaves and produces yellow, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. Its flowers are typically white or pink and are pollinated by bats and insects.</p>
<p>The bark and leaves of the baobab have been used for various medicinal and culinary purposes by local communities.</p>
