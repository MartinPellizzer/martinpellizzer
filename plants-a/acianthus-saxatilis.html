                <h1>Acianthus saxatilis</h1>
<p>Acianthus saxatilis, commonly known as the rock iris, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense clumps.</p>
<p>Acianthus saxatilis is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in rock gardens or as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthus saxatilis has leaves that are narrow, linear, and arranged in a rosette pattern, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a dark brown, rough bark that grows upright from the base. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with pinkish-white petals and a tubular shape, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or dry soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthus saxatilis is primarily native to Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky habitats across the eastern regions of the state. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in coastal and inland areas. It is adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of Queensland.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to specific geological formations and microclimates within the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthus saxatilis was mainly introduced to rocky and coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained, sunny environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in cliffs, gravelly soils, and disturbed habitats along the shoreline. This plant is often associated with maritime climates and can tolerate salt spray and strong winds. Its introduction has been documented in several coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
