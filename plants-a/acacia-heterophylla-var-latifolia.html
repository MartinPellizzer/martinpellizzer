                <h1>Acacia heterophylla var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia heterophylla var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed wattle, is a shrub native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are broader and more rounded compared to typical acacia species. The plant produces yellow globular flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia heterophylla var. latifolia has compound leaves that are alternate, with broad, elliptical leaflets that are light green in color and vary in size.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that has a fibrous texture, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are yellow and clustered in spherical inflorescences, blooming during the autumn season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a flattened pod containing seeds that are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and small size.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
