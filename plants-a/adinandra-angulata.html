                <h1>Adinandra angulata</h1>
<p>Adinandra angulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant is notable for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in construction and tool-making. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra angulata has simple, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, white flowers are clustered in panicles, blooming during the dry season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant in sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra angulata is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia, primarily found in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes tropical rainforests and lowland areas across these regions. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. Adinandra angulata is typically found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status is currently listed as vulnerable.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adinandra angulata is a tropical evergreen shrub known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings being the more reliable method for faster growth. The plant has a slow growth cycle, often taking several years to reach maturity, and thrives in warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects in poor conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants like hibiscus or ferns can enhance its growth and aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adinandra angulata is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds due to its flowering structure and nectar. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other native flora in the ecosystem. It also plays a role in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity and ecological balance of its environment.</p>
