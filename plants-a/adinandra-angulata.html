                <h1>Adinandra angulata</h1>
<p>Adinandra angulata, commonly known as the angular adinandra, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in forest understories and is often found in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Adinandra angulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra angulata has simple, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green in color, featuring four petals and stamens, and bloom during the dry season, primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soils in which the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra angulata is primarily native to Malaya.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of this area, including parts of Peninsular Malaysia. The plant thrives in lowland and hill forest environments. It is commonly associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Malaya.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra angulata was mainly introduced to urban and suburban areas in South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found along roadsides, in gardens, and on rocky outcrops due to its adaptability to disturbed soils. This plant thrives in full sun and is often used for ornamental purposes because of its attractive, fragrant flowers. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in certain regions, where it competes with native vegetation.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and is generally managed as a non-native ornamental species.</p>
