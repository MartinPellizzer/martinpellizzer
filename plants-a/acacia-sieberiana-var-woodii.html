                        <h1>Acacia sieberiana var. woodii</h1>
<p>Acacia sieberiana var. woodii, commonly known as the white acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its seeds are encased in pod-like structures that split open when mature.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia sieberiana var. woodii is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Sudan, South Sudan, Eritrea, and parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It thrives in savanna and woodland habitats, often found in areas with well-drained soils. This variant is commonly associated with dry to semi-arid environments, where it plays a significant ecological role. It is also occasionally found in parts of the Middle East and southern Arabia.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to seasonal droughts and is often used for its timber and as a source of fuel.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia sieberiana var. woodii was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. This plant is often used for its hard, durable wood and for soil stabilization in degraded lands. It has also been introduced to parts of South America and Southeast Asia for similar purposes.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments.</p>
