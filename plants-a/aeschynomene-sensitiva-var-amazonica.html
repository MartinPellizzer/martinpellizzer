                    <h1>Aeschynomene sensitiva var. amazonica</h1>
<p>Aeschynomene sensitiva var. amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian sensitive plant, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its rapid leaf movement in response to touch, a trait known as thigmonastic movement. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, trifoliate leaves that close when disturbed, a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat.</p>
