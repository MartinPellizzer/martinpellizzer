<p>Aira tenera, commonly known as slender false panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, hairless stems and produces small, fluffy spikelets that resemble those of true panicgrasses. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>Aira tenera is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
