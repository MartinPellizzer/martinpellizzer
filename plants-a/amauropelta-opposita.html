<p>Amauropelta opposita, commonly known as the opposite-leafed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate fronds with leaves arranged in an opposite pattern along the rachis. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a membranous covering called a indusium.</p>
<p>Amauropelta opposita is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
