                <h1>Achimenes candida</h1>
<p>Achimenes candida, commonly known as the white trumpet vine, is a tropical herbaceous plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a contrasting throat. The plant produces oval, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Achimenes candida is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achimenes candida has heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are alternate in arrangement and typically measure 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. Its flowers are trumpet-shaped, with white petals and a yellow throat, blooming from summer to autumn and primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, aiding in water absorption and anchoring the plant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes candida is primarily native to Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico Southeast, Mexico Southwest, and Panamá.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant is known for its showy, white flowers that bloom during the rainy season.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of Central America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achimenes candida was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive flowers. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a potential weed in certain regions. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and can spread rapidly if left unchecked.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
