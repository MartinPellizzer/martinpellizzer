<p>Arisaema chumponense, commonly known as the Chumpon arrowhead, is a member of the Araceae family native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and an umbel of small, greenish-white spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream sides. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces berries that are dispersed by animals.</p>
