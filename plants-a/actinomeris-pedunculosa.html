                <h1>Actinomeris pedunculosa</h1>
<p>Actinomeris pedunculosa, commonly known as the clustered starwort, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its erect, flowering stems that bear clusters of small, white or pink flowers. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a distinctive veining pattern.</p>
<p>Actinomeris pedunculosa thrives in harsh, cold environments and is often found growing in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinomeris pedunculosa has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green color and a smooth texture, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinomeris pedunculosa is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. This plant thrives in areas with rich, organic soil and is often associated with hardwood forests. Its distribution extends from New York to Georgia, with isolated populations in parts of Tennessee and Kentucky.</p>
<p>It is considered a rare and endangered species, requiring specific habitat conditions to survive.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinomeris pedunculosa was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was primarily spread through human activities such as gardening and horticultural trade. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it common in forested areas. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant species.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
