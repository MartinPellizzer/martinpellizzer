                <h1>Adhatoda guineensis</h1>
<p>Adhatoda guineensis, commonly known as African skullcap, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stem and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. It is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges.</p>
<p>Adhatoda guineensis is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda guineensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown to reddish in color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are tubular with five lobes, predominantly purple in color, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda guineensis is a flowering plant native to western and central Africa, including countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Cameroon.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of Asia, particularly in India and Sri Lanka, where it has been introduced for medicinal purposes. This species thrives in moist, tropical environments, often growing in forest understories or along riverbanks. It typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Adhatoda guineensis is currently listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, although its populations are under threat due to habitat loss and overharvesting.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda guineensis is a flowering plant native to West Africa, known for its medicinal properties and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with stem cuttings being more reliable for faster growth. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adhatoda guineensis is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to biodiversity in its habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, which are essential for its reproduction and the health of the ecosystem. The plant also acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other species in the surrounding area. Additionally, its deep root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing the soil.</p>
<p>Adhatoda guineensis plays a vital role in maintaining ecological balance through its multiple environmental benefits.</p>
