                <h1>Adhatoda guineensis</h1>
<p>Adhatoda guineensis, commonly known as African arrowroot or African sarsaparilla, is a shrub native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elliptical, blue-black berries. Its roots and leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda guineensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, fissured bark that is grayish-brown in color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are tubular, with five lobes, and are typically blue or violet in color, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda guineensis is primarily native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Nigeria and Cameroon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland areas with rich soils. This plant thrives in moist environments and is often associated with forest understory habitats. It is also known to grow in swampy or riverine areas where the climate is warm and humid.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends to parts of Central and West Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda guineensis was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Nigeria, India, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its medicinal properties. It has been introduced to new areas for both traditional medicine and ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>However, its spread can sometimes lead to ecological impacts in non-native environments.</p>
