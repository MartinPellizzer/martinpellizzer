                <h1>Acampe dentata</h1>
<p>Acampe dentata, commonly known as the toothed acampe, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are deeply toothed, giving it its scientific name, and it produces small yellow flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Acampe dentata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acampe dentata has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with serrated margins and a dark green upper surface.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, woody, and have a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acampe dentata is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Iberian Peninsula, the Balearic Islands, and coastal areas of southern France. It thrives in rocky, coastal environments and dry, sunny slopes, often growing in disturbed or marginal habitats. Acampe dentata is typically found at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 500 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes raise concerns for its long-term conservation status.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acampe dentata is a hardy perennial plant known for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seeds sown in late winter. The growth cycle of Acampe dentata begins with germination in spring, followed by rapid growth and flowering in summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acampe dentata is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies due to its fragrant flowers and nectar. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants by improving soil conditions. It also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acampe dentata contributes to biodiversity by offering habitat and sustenance to a wide range of ecological organisms.</p>
