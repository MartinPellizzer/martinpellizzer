                <h1>Asclepias cordifolia</h1>
<p>Asclepias cordifolia, commonly known as heartleaf milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features lanceolate to heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive reddish or purplish tinge. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers that are arranged in umbels, typical of the milkweed genus. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by butterflies, particularly the monarch butterfly, which relies on it as a host plant for its larvae.</p>
<p>Asclepias cordifolia also contains latex sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation.</p>
