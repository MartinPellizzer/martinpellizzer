                <h1>Aegiphila hastingsiana</h1>
<p>Aegiphila hastingsiana, commonly known as the Hastings' aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, narrow leaves, and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila hastingsiana has small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with pinkish-white petals that bloom in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry, rocky habitats where the plant typically grows.</p>
