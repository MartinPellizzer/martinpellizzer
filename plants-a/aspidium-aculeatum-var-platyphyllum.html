<p>Aspidium aculeatum var. platyphyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
