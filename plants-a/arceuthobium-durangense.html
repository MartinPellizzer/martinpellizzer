                    <h1>Arceuthobium durangense</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium durangense, commonly known as the Durango dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is typically found in the mountainous regions of Durango, Mexico, where it parasitizes various grasses and shrubs. Due to its specialized lifestyle and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical research.</p>
