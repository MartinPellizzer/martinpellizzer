                <h1>Actinella odorata</h1>
<p>Actinella odorata, commonly known as the sweet-scented fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that emit a subtle, pleasant fragrance, especially when bruised. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Actinella odorata is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its potential medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinella odorata has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, vertical strips. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella odorata is primarily native to the temperate regions of southern South America, specifically Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Andean foothills and adjacent valleys. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with forested or shrubland habitats. It is known for its fragrant flowers and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in the local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small animals.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella odorata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century as an ornamental plant. The species has since spread beyond its original cultivation sites. It is now found in various habitats, including disturbed areas and along forest edges.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems.</p>
