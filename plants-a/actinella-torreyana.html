                <h1>Actinella torreyana</h1>
<p>Actinella torreyana, commonly known as Torrey's actinella, is a species of flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in forested areas, often forming dense shrubs. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, while its flowers are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Actinella torreyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinella torreyana has small, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually less than 2 inches long, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plant's growth. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal umbels, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella torreyana is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and parts of Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, particularly in chaparral and woodland habitats. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or gravelly terrain. It is most prevalent in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Actinella torreyana is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella torreyana was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, gravelly slopes, and dry meadows. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environments. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in some regions, where it competes with native species.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive potential in certain areas, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in stabilizing soils.</p>
