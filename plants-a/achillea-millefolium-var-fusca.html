                    <h1>Achillea millefolium var. fusca</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium var. fusca, commonly known as dark yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, dark green leaves that are often more densely packed than those of the common yarrow. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and wildflower meadows.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>
