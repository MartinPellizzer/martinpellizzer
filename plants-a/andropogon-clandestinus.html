                    <h1>Andropogon clandestinus</h1>
<p>Andropogon clandestinus, commonly known as the hidden grass, is a member of the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Caribbean. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are often overlooked due to its inconspicuous appearance.</p>
<p>Despite its lack of showy flowers, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
