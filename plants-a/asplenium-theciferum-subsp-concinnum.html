<p>Asplenium theciferum subsp.</p>
<p>concinnum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a member of the Blechnaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, pinnate fronds with closely spaced, lance-shaped pinnae.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky, shaded environments, often on cliffs or in crevices. Its fronds are usually dark green and possess a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
