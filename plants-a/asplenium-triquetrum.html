<p>Asplenium triquetrum, commonly known as the three-lobed spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into three lobes. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices.</p>
<p>Asplenium triquetrum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>
