<p>Arenaria hookeri subsp.</p>
<p>desertorum, commonly known as desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to absorb moisture from the sandy soil.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
