                    <h1>Arrabidaea rhodantha var. induta</h1>
<p>Arrabidaea rhodantha var. induta, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a member of the Fabaceae family and is native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, deciduous tree or shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and reddish color, making it an important resource in local economies.</p>
<p>However, overharvesting has led to its decline, prompting conservation efforts to protect this rare species.</p>
