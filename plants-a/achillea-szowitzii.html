                <h1>Achillea szowitzii</h1>
<p>Achillea szowitzii, commonly known as the Szóczák yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Carpathian Basin.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and flat, composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky soils, preferring well-drained conditions. It produces small white to pale yellow flowers that bloom from June to August, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea szowitzii has basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, dark green in color, and arranged in a rosette formation, with a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a light green color, growing from the base to form a compact plant. Its flowers are yellow, consisting of small composite flower heads with ray florets, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a cypsela, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their small size and feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and deep, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea szowitzii is primarily native to the eastern Mediterranean region, including parts of Turkey, Syria, and Lebanon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and arid environments, such as mountain slopes and dry grasslands. This plant thrives in regions with low precipitation and well-drained soils. It is often associated with areas of low elevation to mid-elevation habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the specific ecological conditions of the eastern Mediterranean basin.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea szowitzii was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fragrant flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and disturbed soils across the western United States. The plant has shown some invasive tendencies in certain regions, outcompeting native flora in moist, open habitats. Despite its ornamental value, its spread has raised concerns among conservationists.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its overgrowth in natural areas.</p>
