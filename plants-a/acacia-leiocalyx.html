                    <h1>Acacia leiocalyx</h1>
<p>Acacia leiocalyx, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching form and phyllodes that are narrow and often curved. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which appear during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a common adaptation in the Acacia genus to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acacia leiocalyx is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species in dry landscapes.</p>
