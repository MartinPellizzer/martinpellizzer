<p>Alnus glutinosa f. sublobata, commonly known as the sticky alder or sublobate alder, is a variant of the European alder.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its gray-brown bark and alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves. The leaves are typically gland-dotted and have a distinctive sticky texture, which is a key identifying feature. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks.</p>
