<p>Aloe intermedia var. asperrima, commonly known as the rough aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a rough, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow-orange flowers, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for xeriscaping and thrives in full sun with minimal water.</p>
