<p>Aspidium malaccense, commonly known as the Malacca water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, helping to stabilize the substrate.</p>
<p>Aspidium malaccense plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
