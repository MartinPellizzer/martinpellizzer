                <h1>Acer laevigatum var. fargesii</h1>
<p>Acer laevigatum var. fargesii, commonly known as the Farges maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the autumn. The tree typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters and has a rounded, symmetrical crown. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer laevigatum var. fargesii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slender, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with yellowish-green sepals and red stamens, blooming in early spring, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in forested and mountainous environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer laevigatum var. fargesii is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of western China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While its native range was once broader, its current distribution is limited to specific high-altitude areas in these regions. It thrives in cool, moist temperate environments, typically found in forests and mountain valleys. This species grows at altitudes between 2,000 and 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural regeneration, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer laevigatum var. fargesii is a decorative tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. The growth cycle includes a dormant phase in winter, active growth in spring, and a period of leaf color change in fall.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering promote healthy growth, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its ornamental appeal and support a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer laevigatum var. fargesii is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting soil stability. Its roots help prevent erosion, making it useful in stabilizing soil in hilly or disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing habitat for small animals.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer laevigatum var. fargesii is a lesser-known ornamental tree primarily valued for its aesthetic appeal in horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine. The tree's wood, though not commonly used industrially, contributes to local economies in regions where it is cultivated. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in some areas, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, its main role remains in ornamental gardening and ecological conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer laevigatum var. fargesii has several popular cultivars such as 'Diablo', 'Crimson King', and 'Orange Queen', which are prized for their vibrant autumn foliage and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>This variety is also involved in the creation of hybrids like the popular 'Autumn Blaze' maple, which combines the ornamental qualities of multiple species. Its unique leaf coloration and adaptability make it a valuable addition to horticultural collections. The plant is widely cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal and seasonal display.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, Acer laevigatum var. fargesii holds significant horticultural importance in the cultivation of decorative trees.</p>
