                    <h1>Acacia sessilis</h1>
<p>Acacia sessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and phyllodes that are typically narrow and sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are pollinated by insects and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are adapted for dispersal by animals.</p>
<p>Acacia sessilis is often found in dry, sandy soils and is well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
