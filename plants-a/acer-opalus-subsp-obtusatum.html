                <h1>Acer opalus subsp. obtusatum</h1>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>obtusatum, commonly known as the Kashmir maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking red to orange foliage that turns vibrant in the autumn.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges and a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>obtusatum has alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 5â€“10 cm long, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, turning vibrant yellow in autumn. The stem is slender with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and clustered in panicles, with yellowish-green petals, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to well-drained soils in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>obtusatum is a rare maple species native to the eastern Himalayas, primarily found in countries such as Nepal, Bhutan, and northern India. While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other regions, including parts of southern China and Southeast Asia, though its current distribution remains restricted.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, temperate forests with well-drained soil, often growing in shaded understories. This species typically occurs at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered, facing threats from deforestation and habitat fragmentation.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>obtusatum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and unique leaf shape. It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination.</p>
<p>The tree grows slowly, reaching maturity over several decades, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogged roots. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or roses can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>obtusatum is a small tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The tree acts as a companion plant in mixed-species forests, enhancing soil health and promoting ecosystem stability. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that binds soil together.</p>
<p>Additionally, its presence supports a variety of ecological benefits by creating microhabitats and improving overall habitat quality.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>obtusatum is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas. It has been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, though research is still in early stages.</p>
<p>The wood of this species is not widely used industrially due to its scarcity and limited availability. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in certain regions, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications remain niche, primarily in ecological and ornamental contexts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer opalus subsp.</p>
<p>obtusatum has several popular cultivars such as 'Aureum', known for its golden leaves, and 'Variegatum', which features striking variegated foliage. It also has hybrids with other maple species, contributing to the diversity of ornamental maples in horticulture.</p>
<p>These varieties are highly valued for their vibrant autumn colors and unique leaf patterns. They are widely used in gardens and parks for their aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Due to their ornamental value, they hold significant horticultural importance in landscape design.</p>
