                <h1>Acer campestre var. integrilobum</h1>
<p>Acer campestre var. integrilobum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved field maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, oval-shaped leaves that remain smooth-margined throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras in the fall. It typically grows in open woodlands, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>The smooth-leaved field maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting various insect and bird species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. integrilobum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size of about 5-10 cm in length, and a dark green color on the upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and grows upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out, providing stability and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. integrilobum is a variant of the hedge maple, native to parts of Central and Eastern Europe, including countries such as Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>While its native range is relatively restricted, it has been introduced to other regions, including parts of North America, where it is cultivated in gardens and parks. It thrives in temperate climates, often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and along stream banks. This species typically grows at elevations ranging from 200 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, it is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, though its limited native range warrants some monitoring.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. integrilobum is a compact, slow-growing deciduous shrub or small tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, semi-hardwood cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method. The plant enters a dormant phase in winter and actively grows during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry spells but avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like thyme or rosemary can help repel pests and enhance the garden's biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. integrilobum is a hardy, small tree that provides food and shelter for a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The tree acts as a companion plant in woodland settings, enhancing biodiversity and supporting soil stability. Its extensive root system helps prevent erosion, making it valuable for land restoration projects.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing habitat for various species.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. integrilobum is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use due to its small, bitter fruits.</p>
<p>However, it has historical medicinal applications, with its bark and leaves used in traditional remedies for their astringent properties. Industrially, it contributes to ecological stability by supporting local biodiversity and soil conservation. Culturally, it is valued in certain regions for its ornamental appeal and symbolic representation of resilience in natural landscapes.</p>
<p>Overall, its role is more ecological and symbolic than practical in modern applications.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. integrilobum has several popular cultivars that are widely appreciated for their ornamental value, such as 'Globemaster' and 'Crimson King,' which are known for their compact growth and striking foliage.</p>
<p>This variety also serves as a parent in the creation of numerous hybrids, including those that exhibit enhanced cold hardiness or unique leaf coloration. Its horticultural importance lies in its adaptability to various soil conditions and its role in urban landscaping due to its tolerance of pollution and compact size. Additionally, it is often used in breeding programs to improve traits in other maple species.</p>
<p>Its aesthetic appeal and resilience make it a favored choice for gardens and public spaces.</p>
