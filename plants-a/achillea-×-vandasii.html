                    <h1>Achillea × vandasii</h1>
<p>Achillea × vandasii, commonly known as the hybrid yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and flat, composite flower heads.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Achillea millefolium (common yarrow) and Achillea ptarmica (purple yarrow), resulting in a plant with distinctive horticultural traits. The flowers typically range in color from white to pink and are arranged in dense, showy clusters. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden landscapes for its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It prefers full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
