<p>Agapetes hyalocheilos, commonly known as the silver-flowered heath, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The plant is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
