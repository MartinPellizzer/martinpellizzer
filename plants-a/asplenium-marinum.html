                    <h1>Asplenium marinum</h1>
<p>Asplenium marinum, commonly known as sea holly, is a small evergreen fern native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in maritime climates where it tolerates high levels of salt spray. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the leaves.</p>
<p>Asplenium marinum is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in coastal gardens.</p>
