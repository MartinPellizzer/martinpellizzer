                    <h1>Agrostis holgateana</h1>
<p>Agrostis holgateana, commonly known as Holgate's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, tufted shoots and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range.</p>
