                    <h1>Arundo hyperborea</h1>
<p>Arundo hyperborea, commonly known as the mountain reed, is a tall perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and river valleys. The plant can grow up to 3 meters in height, with long, narrow leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its flowering spikes produce small, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Arundo hyperborea is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in basket-making and as a source of thatching.</p>
