                <h1>Adonis alpina</h1>
<p>Adonis alpina, commonly known as the alpine adonis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves and produces striking yellow flowers with prominent orange markings. The plant is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils at high elevations. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the snow has fully melted.</p>
<p>Adonis alpina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis alpina has simple, basal leaves that are oblanceolate in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and has a smooth, reddish-brown bark, growing from the base of the plant. Its flowers are yellow, tubular, and arranged in a raceme, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from poor, rocky alpine soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis alpina is primarily native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in alpine and mountainous regions, particularly in the Mediterranean area. This plant thrives in rocky and open habitats, often growing on slopes and in meadows at high elevations. It is also present in parts of the British Isles and Scandinavia.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes countries such as Spain, Italy, France, and Turkey.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis alpina was mainly introduced to North America through human activities such as horticultural trade and intentional planting.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and open areas, including roadsides, meadows, and forest edges. The plant has established itself in several regions, particularly in the western United States. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, its spread requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
