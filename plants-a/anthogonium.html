<p>Anthogonium, commonly known as the "water clover," is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It features small, floating leaves that are typically four-lobed, resembling a four-leaf clover. These plants are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Anthogonium species are characterized by their ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters and their role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>They are also used in phytoremediation due to their capacity to absorb heavy metals from the water.</p>
