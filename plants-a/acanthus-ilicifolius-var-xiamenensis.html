                    <h1>Acanthus ilicifolius var. xiamenensis</h1>
<p>Acanthus ilicifolius var. xiamenensis, commonly known as the Xiamen acanthus, is a rare variant of the acanthus plant native to southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, fuzzy hair. The plant produces spiny, egg-shaped fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically along rocky stream banks or in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
