                <h1>Acosta rutifolia</h1>
<p>Acosta rutifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf acosta, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, red berries. Its leaves are typically rough or hairy, giving it its common name, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Acosta rutifolia is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta rutifolia has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat woody, with a rough, bark-like texture and a reddish-brown color. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule containing numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta rutifolia is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in humid climates and is typically associated with forest understories or along riverbanks. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these countries.</p>
<p>Acosta rutifolia is not found outside of its native range in South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta rutifolia was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought in during the early 20th century as part of ornamental plant introductions. The plant is now found in several states including Oregon and Washington. It has adapted well to the local climate and soil conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species and has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
