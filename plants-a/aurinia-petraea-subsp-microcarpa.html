<p>Aurinia petraea subsp.</p>
<p>microcarpa, commonly known as the rock aurinia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
