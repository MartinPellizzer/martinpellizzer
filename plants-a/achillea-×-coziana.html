                <h1>Achillea × coziana</h1>
<p>Achillea × coziana, commonly known as the hybrid yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, silver-green leaves that are aromatic and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, flat, yellowish-white flower heads that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its botanical name reflects its hybrid origin between Achillea millefolium and Achillea ptarmica.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × coziana has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stems are cylindrical and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age, and they grow upright with a somewhat spreading habit. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disc florets surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a dry, achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, and the seeds are small and numerous.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × coziana is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans, particularly in parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that includes cultivation in gardens and botanical collections across Europe and North America. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes and meadows. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 600 to 1,800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its status as a hybrid and limited natural habitat, it is considered of conservation concern in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea × coziana is a compact, hardy perennial known for its showy, flat-topped flowers and ability to thrive in garden settings.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer, though division is more reliable for maintaining the parent plant's characteristics. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering occurring in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper spacing and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender, thyme, or echinacea can enhance its appearance and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea × coziana is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, which contribute to the ecosystem's biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil along slopes and in gardens.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers shelter and habitat for small insects and invertebrates, contributing to a balanced ecological environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea × coziana is a hybrid plant known for its ornamental value and is commonly used in gardens and landscaping due to its attractive, fluffy flowers.</p>
