                <h1>Aegiceras floridum</h1>
<p>Aegiceras floridum, commonly known as the Florida mangrove, is a halophytic tree native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It possesses a unique ability to tolerate and thrive in saline environments, making it an essential component of mangrove ecosystems. The plant has a buttressed trunk and produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Aegiceras floridum plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiceras floridum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth surface and a bluish-green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with pale yellow petals and a short blooming period during the summer months, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, making it a hardy plant in coastal environments.</p>
