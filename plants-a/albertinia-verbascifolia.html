<p>Albertinia verbascifolia, commonly known as the yellow sandbur, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble small burrs, which aid in seed dispersal. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open grasslands and along roadsides.</p>
