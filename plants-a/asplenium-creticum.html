<p>Asplenium creticum, commonly known as the Cretan spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and leathery. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Asplenium creticum is known for its resilience and ability to survive in nutrient-poor substrates.</p>
