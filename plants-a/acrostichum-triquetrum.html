                <h1>Acrostichum triquetrum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum triquetrum, commonly known as the three-angled fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, triquetrous (three-angled) fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its fronds are usually pinnate, with a soft, leathery texture and a pale green color.</p>
<p>Acrostichum triquetrum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in humid climates with well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum triquetrum has large, triangular, dark green leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a waxy surface and a serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is stout and erect, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed, spiky capsule that disperses seeds by wind once it opens.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum triquetrum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of rivers and lakes. This fern thrives in areas with high humidity and consistent moisture, often growing in dense stands. It is also present in parts of the Caribbean and may have been introduced to other tropical regions.</p>
<p>Its native range includes countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum triquetrum was mainly introduced to coastal and brackish water environments, where it thrives in saline and periodically flooded soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mangrove swamps and estuaries, often forming dense stands that stabilize shorelines. This plant is adapted to tolerate high salinity and fluctuating water levels, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Its introduction has sometimes led to changes in local vegetation dynamics.</p>
<p>However, it is generally considered a non-invasive species in the regions where it is established.</p>
