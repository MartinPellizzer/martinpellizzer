                <h1>Adenophora grandiflora</h1>
<p>Adenophora grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has heart-shaped to oval leaves with a rough texture. It produces small, oval berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans.</p>
<p>Adenophora grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophora grandiflora has leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat woody at the base, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. Its flowers are bell-shaped, clustered in umbels, and feature a pale blue to purple color, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind after the capsule splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora grandiflora is primarily native to Korea.</p>

<p>Adenophora grandiflora is an important component of the local flora and is valued for its ornamental qualities.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophora grandiflora was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky slopes. This plant is known for its showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It has been introduced to various regions outside its native range, including parts of North America.</p>
