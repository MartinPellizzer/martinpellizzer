                <h1>Acrocoryne caribaea</h1>
<p>Acrocoryne caribaea, commonly known as the Cuban mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its straight, heavy, and durable timber, which has historically been highly valued for its fine grain and workability. The plant typically grows in lowland forests and has a tall, slender trunk with a crown of spreading branches. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicles.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural dispersal in the ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocoryne caribaea has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, while the underside is lighter in color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical and somewhat woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grayish-brown in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are yellowish-green in color, with a tubular structure and five petals, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in the soil and helping it to absorb nutrients from the surrounding environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocoryne caribaea is primarily native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. This plant thrives in humid, lowland areas with well-drained soils, often in secondary forests or along riverbanks. It is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>The species is also known to occur in parts of the Caribbean, including the islands of Cuba and Hispaniola.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocoryne caribaea was mainly introduced to the Caribbean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, palm-like appearance.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant has been reported to spread rapidly in certain areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems. Despite its aesthetic value, its invasive tendencies have led to its classification as a weed in some regions.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its unchecked spread and minimize ecological disruption.</p>
