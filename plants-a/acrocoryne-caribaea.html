                    <h1>Acrocoryne caribaea</h1>
<p>Acrocoryne caribaea, commonly known as the Cuban mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its straight, heavy, and durable timber, which has historically been highly valued for its fine grain and workability. The plant typically grows in lowland forests and has a tall, slender trunk with a crown of spreading branches. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicles.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural dispersal in the ecosystem.</p>
