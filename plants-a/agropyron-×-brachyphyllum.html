                    <h1>Agropyron × brachyphyllum</h1>
<p>Agropyron × brachyphyllum, commonly known as the wheatgrasses, is a hybrid grass species that combines traits from both Agropyron and Brachypodium.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and often forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant typically has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and potential for forage use, it has been studied for agricultural and ecological applications.</p>
