                    <h1>Avena glumosa</h1>
<p>Avena glumosa, commonly known as the slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, which develop into dry, three-angled fruits known as caryopses. Avena glumosa is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat restoration.</p>
