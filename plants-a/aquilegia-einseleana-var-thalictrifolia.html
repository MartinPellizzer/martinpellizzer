                    <h1>Aquilegia einseleana var. thalictrifolia</h1>
<p>Aquilegia einseleana var. thalictrifolia, commonly known as the Thalictrifolia columbine, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spurred petals that resemble those of the genus Thalictrum, giving it its hybrid name. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Carpathians in Romania, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
