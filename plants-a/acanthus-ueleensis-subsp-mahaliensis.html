<p>Acanthus ueleensis subsp.</p>
<p>mahaliensis, commonly known as the Mahali's spiny acanthus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spiny leaves and showy, violet-blue bracts that surround its small flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions. Its leaves are palmately lobed with sharp, spine-like projections, and its inflorescences are clustered in whorls along the stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and degradation.</p>
