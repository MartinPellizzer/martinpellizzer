                    <h1>Apodocephala begueana</h1>
<p>Apodocephala begueana, commonly known as the Begue's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees, primarily in the genus *Celtis*.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its leaf-like stems and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system. It produces small, fleshy berries that are typically dispersed by birds, contributing to its reproductive success.</p>
<p>Apodocephala begueana is native to parts of Central and South America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
