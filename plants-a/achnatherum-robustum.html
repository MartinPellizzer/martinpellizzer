                <h1>Achnatherum robustum</h1>
<p>Achnatherum robustum, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed spikelets.</p>
<p>Achnatherum robustum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife and livestock.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum robustum has narrow, grass-like leaves that are flat, parallel-veined, and typically range from 10 to 30 centimeters in length, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and cylindrical, growing in dense tufts or clumps, with a light green to slightly reddish-brown color. Its spike-like flowers are arranged in panicles, featuring small, spikelet-like units with two to three bracts, and they bloom in late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry, indehiscent achene, and seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The root system is fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum robustum is primarily native to central and eastern Asia, including regions such as China, Mongolia, and the Russian Far East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in temperate grasslands, steppes, and open forests. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with dry or semi-arid environments. It is also present in parts of North America, particularly in the western United States.</p>
<p>Achnatherum robustum is known for its tufted growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum robustum was mainly introduced to areas with dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with moderate to high precipitation, particularly in the western United States. This plant thrives in full sun and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It is often seen growing in association with other grasses and forbs in native plant communities.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it has become a common invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
