<p>Alchemilla chalarodesma, commonly known as the golden tansy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are hairy and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
