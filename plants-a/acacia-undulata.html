                    <h1>Acacia undulata</h1>
<p>Acacia undulata, commonly known as the wavy acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and small, compound leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or pale-colored hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils and in open woodlands.</p>
<p>Acacia undulata is adapted to withstand drought and has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper underground.</p>
