<p>Aloe abyssinica var. percrassa, commonly known as the Abyssinian aloe, is a succulent plant native to the highlands of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow to orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties, and it is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The varietal name 'percrassa' refers to its thick, robust leaves, distinguishing it from other Aloe species.</p>
