                    <h1>Arenaria laricifolia var. marcescens</h1>
<p>Arenaria laricifolia var. marcescens, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, arid environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and tundra habitats.</p>
<p>Its varietal name, *marcescens*, refers to the tendency of its leaves to remain on the plant throughout the winter, a trait that aids in insulation and moisture retention.</p>
