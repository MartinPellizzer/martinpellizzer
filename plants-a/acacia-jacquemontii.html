                        <h1>Acacia jacquemontii</h1>
<p>Acacia jacquemontii, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow floral spikes, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has feathery, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Acacia jacquemontii is also notable for its role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia jacquemontii is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in a variety of habitats, including savannas, woodlands, and rocky outcrops. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in areas with low rainfall. It is commonly found in regions with well-drained soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia jacquemontii was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered an environmental weed in certain regions. The plant's rapid growth and prolific seed production contribute to its invasive potential. It is particularly problematic in coastal and disturbed habitats where it can outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Management efforts often focus on early detection and control to prevent further spread.</p>
