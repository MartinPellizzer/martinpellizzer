                <h1>Acoridium oliganthum</h1>
<p>Acoridium oliganthum, commonly known as the slender swamp lily, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Acoraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves and small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It has a short rhizomatous stem and produces a single spike of flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acoridium oliganthum has leaves that are broad, elliptical in shape, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium oliganthum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, moist soil, often found in primary and secondary forests. This plant is commonly associated with swampy or seasonally flooded habitats, where it can access the water it requires for growth. It is also occasionally found in parts of the Indian subcontinent, including northeastern India and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Acoridium oliganthum is considered a vulnerable species in many of its native ranges.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acoridium oliganthum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of botanical collections and has since become naturalized in certain regions. The plant is typically found in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in disturbed or open habitats. It is considered a non-native species with limited ecological impact.</p>
<p>Its distribution remains relatively localized compared to other introduced plants in New Zealand.</p>
