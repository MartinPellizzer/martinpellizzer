<p>Astragalus oreades, commonly known as mountain milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, dry habitats such as slopes and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow or pale yellow pea-like flowers. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Astragalus oreades is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators.</p>
