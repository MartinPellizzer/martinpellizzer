                <h1>Aconitum coriaceifolium</h1>
<p>Aconitum coriaceifolium, commonly known as the rough-leaved aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense racemes. Its leaves are palmately compound, with rough, textured surfaces and serrated edges.</p>
<p>Aconitum coriaceifolium contains potent toxins, making it highly poisonous to both humans and animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum coriaceifolium has large, compound leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a leathery texture and a dark green upper surface contrasting with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is typically smooth and somewhat hairy, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense spikes, and they are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storage and survival in harsh environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum coriaceifolium is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe, including parts of the Carpathian Mountains and the Alps.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky or forested areas with cool, moist conditions. This species is commonly associated with alpine meadows and subalpine forests, where it benefits from the well-drained soils and limited competition. It is also present in some regions of northern Asia, such as the Caucasus and parts of Turkey.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized plant in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum coriaceifolium was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and showy blue to purple flowers.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic value. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it adaptable to various garden settings.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to spread beyond controlled environments.</p>
