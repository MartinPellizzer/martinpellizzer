                    <h1>Agropyron cristatum f. hirsutissimum</h1>
<p>Agropyron cristatum f. hirsutissimum, commonly known as the hairy crested wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive, crested inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil, making it valuable for erosion control. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with fine, hairy structures, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>This form is often used in reclamation projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
