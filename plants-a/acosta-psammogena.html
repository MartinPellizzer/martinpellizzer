                <h1>Acosta psammogena</h1>
<p>Acosta psammogena, commonly known as the sand dune plant, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant typically has small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss and help it survive in dry climates. Its flowers are often pale or yellowish, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Acosta psammogena plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta psammogena has leaves that are narrow, linear, and grass-like, arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slightly hairy, and has a grayish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind when it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in sandy soils.</p>
