                <h1>Aconitum deltoideum</h1>
<p>Aconitum deltoideum, commonly known as the deltoid aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum deltoideum has large, deeply lobed leaves that are deltoid in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure up to 15 cm in length; they are a dark green color with a hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and cylindrical, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and arranged in dense clusters, blooming in late summer to early autumn; they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, adapted for storing nutrients and surviving harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum deltoideum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Russia, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This plant is also present in parts of northern China and the Tibetan Plateau. It prefers well-drained soils and cooler climates, often growing at elevations between 2,000 and 4,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum deltoideum was mainly introduced to North America through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental introduction.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream sides. This plant has become naturalized in several regions, often outcompeting native vegetation. Its presence has raised concerns due to its toxicity and potential ecological impact.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, its spread requires careful management to prevent further invasion.</p>
