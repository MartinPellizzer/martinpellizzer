                <h1>Acorus spurius</h1>
<p>Acorus spurius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sweetflag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves and a distinctive, aromatic underground rhizome. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Acorus spurius is often found in shallow water or moist soil, and it plays a role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of healthy, undisturbed wetland environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus spurius has leaves that are sword-shaped, narrow, and slightly curved, arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant, with a dark green color and a glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is short and stout, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright from the base. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a spadix, surrounded by a leaf-like bract, and blooms in early summer, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a three-lobed berry that ripens to a dark purple, dispersing seeds by water and animals.</p>
<p>Its roots are rhizomatous, forming a dense network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the wet soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus spurius is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as China, India, and parts of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant thrives in moist to aquatic environments and is often associated with slow-moving or still water bodies. It is also present in parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Acorus spurius is known for its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and its ability to tolerate a wide range of water conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus spurius was mainly introduced to aquatic and wetland environments in North America, particularly in the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and marshes where it forms dense stands. This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction is often linked to human activities such as landscaping and the release of garden plants into natural waterways.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, Acorus spurius can provide habitat for certain aquatic organisms.</p>
