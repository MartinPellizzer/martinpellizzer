                <h1>Adenandra villosa</h1>
<p>Adenandra villosa, commonly known as the woolly adenandra, is a shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Adenandra villosa is valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and unique texture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenandra villosa has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically 5â€“10 cm long and arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern. The stem is slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin flakes. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, blooming in spring, and is pollinated by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra villosa is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern and western parts of the country, including the provinces of KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, and parts of the Free State. This plant typically grows in forested areas and on rocky outcrops, often in regions with a subtropical climate. It is commonly associated with moist, well-drained soils and can be found in both natural and cultivated settings.</p>
<p>Adenandra villosa is an important species in the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenandra villosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the North Island, where it thrives in coastal and disturbed soils. The plant's rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas have led to its classification as an environmental weed in some parts of its range. Despite its invasive tendencies, it is still cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and public landscapes.</p>
<p>However, its spread poses challenges for native ecosystems, prompting management efforts to control its proliferation.</p>
