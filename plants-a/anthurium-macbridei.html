<p>Anthurium macbridei, commonly known as the MacBride's flamingo flower, is a tropical plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped, brightly colored spathe that resembles a flower, though it is actually a modified leaf. The plant produces small, spadix-like inflorescences that are often hidden within the spathe. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Anthurium macbridei is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its vibrant appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
