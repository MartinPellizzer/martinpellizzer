<p>Atriplex eximia, commonly known as shadscale, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Atriplex eximia is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in conditions with low precipitation.</p>
<p>Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
