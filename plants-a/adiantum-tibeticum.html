                <h1>Adiantum tibeticum</h1>
<p>Adiantum tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky slopes or in mountain forests. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, tooth-like serrations along the edges.</p>
<p>Adiantum tibeticum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in humid, indoor environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum tibeticum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and are typically arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually small, ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters in length, and have a light green to silver-gray color due to their finely serrated margins. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a compact, bushy pattern. Adiantum tibeticum does not produce flowers; instead, it reproduces via spores, which are released from small, sporangia-bearing structures on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and rhizomatous, helping it to anchor in rocky or moist soil environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum tibeticum is primarily native to Afghanistan, China South-Central, East Himalaya, Nepal, Pakistan, Tibet, and West Himalaya.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in high-altitude regions within these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and rocky slopes. The plant is well adapted to the cold and humid conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution spans across several mountainous regions in Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum tibeticum was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its delicate fronds and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and greenhouses, where it is appreciated for its aesthetic appeal. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden areas. Its introduction has led to its cultivation in regions with temperate climates, though it is not considered invasive in most areas.</p>
<p>Despite its popularity, it remains a relatively rare species in the wild outside of its native range in Asia.</p>
