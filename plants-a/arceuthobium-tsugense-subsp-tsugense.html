<p>Arceuthobium tsugense subsp.</p>
<p>tsugense, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily infests hemlock trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, forming dense clusters on the branches.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by wind after the fruit bursts. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, leading to the formation of characteristic galls.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to the Pacific Northwest and is an important component of the forest ecosystem.</p>
