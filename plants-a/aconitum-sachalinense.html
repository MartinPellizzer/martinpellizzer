                <h1>Aconitum sachalinense</h1>
<p>Aconitum sachalinense, commonly known as the Sakhalin aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Far East of Russia and parts of Korea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed divisions, and are covered in a fine layer of silky hairs.</p>
<p>Aconitum sachalinense is known for its toxic alkaloids, making it a plant that requires careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum sachalinense has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically measuring up to 20 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age, growing in a straight, unbranched pattern. The flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petal-like sepals and a spurred structure, blooming in late summer to early autumn and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum sachalinense is primarily native to Japan, the Kuril Islands, and Sakhalin.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the temperate regions of these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and mountainous regions. The species is well adapted to the cool climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the Far East of Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum sachalinense was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in gardens and naturalized in various regions, particularly in the northeastern United States and parts of Canada. Although it is not considered invasive in most areas, it has established populations in some wetland and woodland habitats. The plant's introduction has raised concerns about its potential ecological impact on native flora.</p>
<p>It is often found growing along stream banks and in moist, shaded areas where it thrives.</p>
