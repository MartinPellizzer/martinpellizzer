                    <h1>Athroandra rivularis</h1>
<p>Athroandra rivularis, commonly known as the river alder, is a small evergreen shrub native to the wetlands and riverbanks of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, with dense, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Athroandra rivularis is adapted to moist, nutrient-rich soils and plays a role in stabilizing riverbanks and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
