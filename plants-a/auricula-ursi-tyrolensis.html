                    <h1>Auricula-ursi tyrolensis</h1>
<p>Auricula-ursi tyrolensis, commonly known as the Tyrolean bear's ear, is a rare and alpine plant native to the high mountain regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that resemble the ears of a bear. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink or red flowers in the summer months. It thrives in rocky, acidic soils at high altitudes, often in subalpine or alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
