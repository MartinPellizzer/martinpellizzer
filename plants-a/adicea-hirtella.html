                <h1>Adicea hirtella</h1>
<p>Adicea hirtella, commonly known as the hairy adicea, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are typically hairy, giving it the common name, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Adicea hirtella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea hirtella has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and exhibits a somewhat woody texture, with a greenish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea hirtella is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including states such as Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often associated with coastal and inland wetlands. It is also present in parts of Central America, including Mexico and the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>Adicea hirtella plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea hirtella was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is believed to have been brought there accidentally through the importation of contaminated plant material or soil. The plant has since established itself in certain regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to spread rapidly and compete with native species.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to monitor and control its spread to protect local biodiversity.</p>
