                <h1>Actinodaphne samarensis</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne samarensis, commonly known as the Samarensis camphor tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, avocados, and cinnamon trees. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. It produces small, white flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its aromatic wood and is often found in lowland to montane forests.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne samarensis has leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a pale brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows as a small tree with a compact crown. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, oblong drupe, turning from green to yellow when mature, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne samarensis is primarily native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the islands of Mindanao and Samar. This plant typically grows in lowland to mid-elevation forests, often in areas with high humidity and rainfall. It is commonly associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within the Philippines.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne samarensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where its environmental conditions match its growth requirements.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, typically in lowland forests. This plant has been introduced to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines, as well as some regions in Oceania. Its introduction is often associated with horticultural trade and landscape gardening.</p>
<p>However, its spread outside its native range is limited due to specific ecological needs.</p>
