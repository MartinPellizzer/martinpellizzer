                    <h1>Athyrium liangwangshanicum</h1>
<p>Athyrium liangwangshanicum, commonly known as the Liangwangshan Athyrium, is a rare fern species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Athyriaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, where it thrives on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
