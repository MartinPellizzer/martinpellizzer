<p>Arethusa foliosa, commonly known as the sea onion, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the United States and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, often in brackish or saltwater environments. Its leaves are typically used in traditional medicine and as a vegetable, while its bulbs are edible and resemble onions.</p>
<p>Arethusa foliosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
