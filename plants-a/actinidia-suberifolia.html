                <h1>Actinidia suberifolia</h1>
<p>Actinidia suberifolia, commonly known as the silver vine, is a deciduous climbing shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, woody stems that can climb or trail along surfaces. The leaves are heart-shaped, with a silvery underside that gives the plant its common name. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, followed by edible, fuzzy berries that ripen to a dark purple color.</p>
<p>This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia suberifolia has heart-shaped, simple leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with separate male and female parts, blooming in late spring, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, fuzzy, yellowish berry that ripens in late summer, and it is dispersed primarily by birds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, often forming a dense network near the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia suberifolia is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>This species is found in the mountainous regions of this area, where it thrives in temperate climates. It is commonly associated with forests and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils. The plant is part of the Actinidiaceae family and is known for its edible berries.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific habitats within southern and central China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia suberifolia was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and potential for use in landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in gardens and botanical collections for its unique leaf structure and adaptability to various soil types. Although it is not widely naturalized, it has been reported in several regions where it has escaped cultivation. The plant is considered a non-native species in these areas, though it does not pose significant ecological threat at this time.</p>
<p>Its introduction has primarily been for horticultural purposes rather than for agricultural or ecological reasons.</p>
