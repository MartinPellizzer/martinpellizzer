                    <h1>Asplenium alternifolium</h1>
<p>Asplenium alternifolium, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a dense, compact rosette of leaves that form a tight cluster. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in the wild.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its ability to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited for indoor cultivation.</p>
