<p>Anthocerastes drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's hornwort, is a type of liverwort found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Peltogynandraceae and is characterized by its small, branching stems covered in leaf-like structures. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are typically located at the tips of the stems. Anthocerastes drummondii thrives in wetlands and along the edges of streams, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and aquatic adaptations make it an important component of freshwater ecosystems.</p>
