                    <h1>Alexa imperatricis var. glabra</h1>
<p>Alexa imperatricis var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth imperial alexandra, is a rare and ornamental plant native to specific regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, which makes it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this endangered species from habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
