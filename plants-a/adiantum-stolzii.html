                <h1>Adiantum stolzii</h1>
<p>Adiantum stolzii, commonly known as the Stolz's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi-lobed. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means.</p>
<p>Adiantum stolzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum stolzii has fern-like leaves that are finely divided, pinnate in structure, and typically arranged in a single plane, giving the plant a delicate, airy appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually green, with a bluish tinge, and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, though they are often smaller in cultivated settings. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome that serves as its stem, with a smooth, pale brown bark that grows horizontally along the ground. Adiantum stolzii produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, and the roots are fibrous, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum stolzii is primarily native to Central African Republic, Mali, Nigeria, Sudan-South Sudan, Tanzania, and Togo.</p>
<p>This fern is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant is part of the Adiantaceae family and is known for its delicate, lace-like fronds.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its adaptation to the humid climates of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum stolzii was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden spaces. This plant is commonly found in parts of Europe, particularly in the UK and southern France. Its delicate fronds and ability to tolerate partial shade contribute to its widespread introduction.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions where it outcompetes native species.</p>
