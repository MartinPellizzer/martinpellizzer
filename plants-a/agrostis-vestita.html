<p>Agrostis vestita, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and it typically forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Agrostis vestita thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, such as soil stabilization and habitat for invertebrates.</p>
