<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are deeply divided into several lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers that are typically borne in dense inflorescences. Acalypha fissa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes in warm climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha fissa has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly pubescent surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length, displaying a vibrant green color with a slight reddish tint on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat woody at maturity, with a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and they are typically greenish-yellow in color, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small, dry, and equipped with a feathery appendage for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha fissa is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is now also distributed in parts of Oceania, including Hawaii and some Pacific islands, where it has been introduced. This species thrives in moist, tropical environments, often growing in lowland rainforests or along riverbanks. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level up to 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Acalypha fissa is considered to be of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha fissa is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant foliage and unique leaf patterns.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. This fast-growing plant thrives in warm climates and has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while diseases like root rot can occur in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
