<p>Anacamptis pyramidalis subsp.</p>
<p>cerigensis, commonly known as the Cerigons Orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the UK. It is characterized by its tall, erect flowering stems that bear dense clusters of pale purple to white flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in damp, calcareous grasslands and is adapted to the specific environmental conditions of its habitat. It has lance-shaped leaves and a short, stout rhizome, which help it thrive in its niche.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
