<p>Alismorkis longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed water plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted for life in still or slow-moving water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in the early summer months. Its rhizomes spread horizontally through the substrate, allowing it to colonize large areas of wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Alismorkis longipes plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
