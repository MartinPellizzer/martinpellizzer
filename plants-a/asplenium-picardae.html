<p>Asplenium picardae, commonly known as the Picard's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, narrow, and often clustered fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in crevices, particularly in temperate regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which is a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Asplenium picardae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
