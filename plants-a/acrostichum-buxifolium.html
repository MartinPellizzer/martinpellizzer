                <h1>Acrostichum buxifolium</h1>
<p>Acrostichum buxifolium, commonly known as the box-leaved fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Davalliaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features dark green, leathery leaves that are oval in shape and have a distinctive boxwood-like texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The foliage is evergreen, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum buxifolium has small, ovate leaves that are glossy green on top and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale brown bark that grows upright and branching. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dark blue drupe containing one seed, which is dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum buxifolium is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and coastal areas. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with mangrove swamps and estuarine habitats. Its distribution is also recorded in parts of New Guinea and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>Acrostichum buxifolium is an important component of the flora in these regions, contributing to the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum buxifolium was mainly introduced to wetland and riparian habitats where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with rich organic soil, often near streams, ponds, or other water bodies. This plant has been reported in several regions of the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered an invasive species in some areas.</p>
