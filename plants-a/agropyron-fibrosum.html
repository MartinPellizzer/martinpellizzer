<p>Agropyron fibrosum, commonly known as the fibrous wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow,坚韧 (fibrous), and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Agropyron fibrosum is often used in erosion control and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
