                    <h1>Aizoon herniariifolium</h1>
<p>Aizoon herniariifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Aizoon herniariifolium plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature.</p>
