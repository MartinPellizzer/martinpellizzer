<p>It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs and often have a reddish or purple tinge. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks.</p>
<p>Acetosella lilacina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acetosella lilacina has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and often reddish in color, growing close to the ground with a creeping growth pattern. Its flowers are small, pink or lilac in color, with five petals and a tubular shape, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when disturbed.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acetosella lilacina is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of North Africa and the Canary Islands. This species thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, heathlands, and rocky slopes. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acetosella lilacina is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acetosella lilacina is a low-growing, flowering plant known for its delicate purple flowers and compact size, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing the plant in early spring, ensuring good root development. The growth cycle of Acetosella lilacina is typically perennial, with new growth emerging in early spring and flowering throughout the summer months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. For optimal growth, it benefits from light fertilization in early spring and regular pruning to maintain its compact form. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract slugs or aphids, which can be managed with organic controls.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
