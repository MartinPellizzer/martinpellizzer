                <h1>Acianthus veillonis</h1>
<p>Acianthus veillonis, commonly known as the veillon's acianthus, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale purple. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and thrives in humid, tropical climates. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Acianthus veillonis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthus veillonis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when dry.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthus veillonis is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the humid lowland forests of the Amazon Basin. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments with rich, organic soil. It is often associated with areas near rivers and streams where the climate is warm and humid.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthus veillonis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically in forested regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often seen in shaded gardens and naturalized settings. Its introduction has been primarily through horticultural trade and accidental spread.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a non-native species in these regions and has not become invasive.</p>
