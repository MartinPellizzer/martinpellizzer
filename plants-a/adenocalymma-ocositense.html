                <h1>Adenocalymma ocositense</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma ocositense, commonly known as the Brazilian velvetleaf, is a species of flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma ocositense is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in local ecosystems as a source of nectar for pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma ocositense has leaves that are alternate, elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub with an upright habit. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma ocositense is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest biome in eastern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is found in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Esp√≠rito Santo. This plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soils. It is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed areas within its native range.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma ocositense plays a role in the ecological dynamics of these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma ocositense was mainly introduced to the data as a rare and unique species with specific ecological requirements.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small size and distinctive foliage, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. The plant's introduction to the dataset highlights its potential role in certain ecosystems and its need for careful management. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
<p>This data entry aids in tracking its presence and supporting efforts to protect its habitat.</p>
