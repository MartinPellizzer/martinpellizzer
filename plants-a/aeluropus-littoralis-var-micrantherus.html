<p>Aeluropus littoralis var. micrantherus, commonly known as the coastal flatsedge, is a halophytic grass species adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and tidal flats, where it tolerates high salinity and periodic inundation. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Its root system helps stabilize sediments, contributing to soil structure in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in the intertidal zones of temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
