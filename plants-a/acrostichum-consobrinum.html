                <h1>Acrostichum consobrinum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum consobrinum, commonly known as the common brake, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum consobrinum has large, feather-like leaves that are pinnately compound, arranged alternately along the stem, and can reach up to 3 meters in length, with a dark green color and a glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, slightly fibrous bark that is typically light brown in color, and it grows in a climbing or trailing pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses its seeds through wind, and the roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum consobrinum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas, swamps, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. This plant thrives in humid environments with abundant moisture and partial to full sunlight. Its natural range includes countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico.</p>
<p>It is often associated with mangrove ecosystems and other coastal wetlands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum consobrinum was mainly introduced to coastal and wetland areas where it can thrive in moist, sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and salt tolerance, making it suitable for mangrove ecosystems. This plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its introduction has been documented in several tropical and subtropical regions worldwide.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
