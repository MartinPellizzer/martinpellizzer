                        <h1>Abrotanum ambiguum</h1>
<p>Abrotanum ambiguum, commonly known as the Mexican feverfew, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30â€“60 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are hairy and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>Abrotanum ambiguum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrotanum ambiguum is primarily native to parts of southern Africa, specifically South Africa and Namibia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the western and central parts of these countries. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen in open shrublands and along rocky outcrops. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in other regions with similar environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrotanum ambiguum was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and drought tolerance. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly along roadsides and in open woodlands.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to alter local ecosystems.</p>
