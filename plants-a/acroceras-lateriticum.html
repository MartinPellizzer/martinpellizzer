                <h1>Acroceras lateriticum</h1>
<p>Acroceras lateriticum, commonly known as the lateritic acroceras, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or lateritic soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers, which are often pink or purple, bloom in clusters and attract various pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acroceras lateriticum has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and slightly rough upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and exhibits a reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing upright with minimal branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in nutrient-poor, lateritic soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroceras lateriticum is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the dry, arid regions of the island, particularly in areas with lateritic soils. This plant thrives in the unique and harsh environmental conditions of Madagascar's interior. It is adapted to the seasonal rainfall patterns and high temperatures typical of the region.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely restricted to specific habitats within Madagascar.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroceras lateriticum was mainly introduced to areas with lateritic soils, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, acidic conditions and is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and degraded forests. This plant is known for its ability to colonize areas with low soil fertility, making it a pioneer species in ecological succession. It has been reported in several countries across Southeast Asia and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
