<p>Acalypha hassleriana var. genuina, commonly known as the red-veined nettle, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves with distinctive red veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in gardens and indoor spaces.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha hassleriana var. genuina has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale greenish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with yellowish-green bracts and stamen, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind after drying.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha hassleriana var. genuina is a rare and endemic plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico, specifically in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations within these areas, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest understories. This species prefers humid tropical environments with well-drained soil, typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,200 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural reproduction, it is considered endangered, with conservation efforts ongoing to protect and propagate this unique species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha hassleriana var. genuina is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant foliage and unique growth patterns.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for quick results. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, thriving in warm climates and typically reaching maturity within a few years.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, avoiding both overwatering and drought conditions. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or mealybugs, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering plants can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acalypha hassleriana var. genuina is a native plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
