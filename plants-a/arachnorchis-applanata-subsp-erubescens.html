<p>Arachnorchis applanata subsp.</p>
<p>erubescens, commonly known as the red-flowered spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It features a slender, hairy rhizome and produces erect, slender stems with a single, showy, red or pinkish-purple flower.</p>
<p>The orchid's unique floral structure includes a spurred labellum and is adapted for pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
