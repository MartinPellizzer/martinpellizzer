                <h1>Actinodaphne morrisonensis</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne morrisonensis, commonly known as Morrison's camphor tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its fruit is a small, woody drupe that contains a single seed.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its timber and has been traditionally used in local medicine and as a source of essential oils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne morrisonensis has elliptical, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a leathery texture and a size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that has a slightly rough texture, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a simple structure, blooming during the wet season, and is pollinated by insects such as bees. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through birds and wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, aiding in water absorption and anchoring the plant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne morrisonensis is primarily native to the island of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is found in the lowland tropical rainforests of the western and central regions of the island. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Its distribution is limited to specific areas within the Indonesian and Papua New Guinean territories.</p>
<p>It is a rare and endemic species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne morrisonensis was mainly introduced to specific regions in Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant is typically associated with moist, shaded environments and thrives in humid tropical climates. Its introduction has been largely due to human activities such as logging and land conversion.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely distributed and remains relatively rare in the wild.</p>
