                <h1>Aconitum sikangense</h1>
<p>Aconitum sikangense, commonly known as the Yunnan monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of southwestern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple spurred flowers. The plant has deeply lobed, palmately compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum sikangense has large, compound leaves that are palmately arranged, with deeply lobed blades that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a dark purple to brown bark that becomes rougher as the plant matures. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple spires composed of numerous small petals, blooming in late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through a spiral mechanism, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, often growing deep into the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum sikangense is primarily native to the eastern Himalayas, including parts of India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude regions, typically between 2,000 and 4,000 meters above sea level. This species thrives in mountainous areas with moist, well-drained soils and cool climates. It is often found in forested slopes, meadows, and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>The plant is particularly prevalent in the states of Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh in India.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum sikangense was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and high elevations, particularly in mountainous areas of Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for shady garden environments. This plant is often cultivated for its striking blue or purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its potent alkaloid content.</p>
<p>However, due to its toxicity, it requires careful handling and is not recommended for use in edible gardens.</p>
