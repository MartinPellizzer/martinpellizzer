                <h1>Acer rotundifolium</h1>
<p>Acer rotundifolium, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rounded, lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 15â€“30 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and urban forestry.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer rotundifolium has rounded, palmate leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in diameter, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are wind-pollinated and have a delicate, five-petaled structure. The fruit is a samara, with two papery wings that aid in wind dispersal, and the seeds are small and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer rotundifolium is a small deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, specifically found in the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Virginia, West Virginia, and Tennessee, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It prefers shaded to partially shaded environments, often growing in mixed hardwood forests. This species typically occurs at altitudes between 600 and 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acer rotundifolium is considered a species of concern in some regions, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer rotundifolium is a deciduous tree known for its unique rounded leaves and vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring, followed by dormancy in winter, making it adaptable to temperate climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally suffer from aphids or leaf spot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving plants like ferns or heathers can enhance its ornamental value in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer rotundifolium is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial for stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil health and offering habitat for insects and birds.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer rotundifolium is a species of maple tree native to North America, known for its distinctive round leaves and vibrant autumn colors.</p>
<p>While it is primarily valued for its ornamental beauty in gardens and landscapes, it also has limited culinary uses, with its young leaves sometimes used in traditional dishes. In traditional medicine, parts of the plant have been used to treat ailments such as inflammation and skin conditions. Economically, it contributes to the horticulture industry by providing ornamental value and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
