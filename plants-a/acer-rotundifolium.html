                    <h1>Acer rotundifolium</h1>
<p>Acer rotundifolium, commonly known as the sugar maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rounded, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and gold in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its sap, which is tapped in the spring, is used to make maple syrup.</p>
<p>The sugar maple is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is a keystone species in many forest ecosystems.</p>
