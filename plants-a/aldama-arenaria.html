                    <h1>Aldama arenaria</h1>
<p>Aldama arenaria, commonly known as the sand dune plant, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, succulent perennial that thrives in sandy soils and is well adapted to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, which helps store water and reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>Aldama arenaria plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
