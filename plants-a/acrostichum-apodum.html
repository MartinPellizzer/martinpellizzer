                <h1>Acrostichum apodum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum apodum, commonly known as the giant reed or giant grass, is a tall, perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that can grow up to several meters in length, often with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found near water bodies.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it an important species in wetland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum apodum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are broad, green, and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which bloom during the summer and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a globose drupe containing one seed, which is dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in wet, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum apodum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, warm climates and is commonly found in lowland rainforests and swampy areas. This plant is well adapted to wetland environments and often grows along riverbanks and in marshy habitats. It is also present in parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for moist conditions, it is often used in ornamental landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum apodum was mainly introduced to coastal areas and wetlands in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mangrove ecosystems and brackish water environments. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate saline conditions. Its introduction has been documented in several countries along the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
