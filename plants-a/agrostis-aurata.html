                    <h1>Agrostis aurata</h1>
<p>Agrostis aurata, commonly known as golden bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and bright golden-green foliage that turns a striking copper color in the autumn. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Agrostis aurata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and seasonal color changes.</p>
