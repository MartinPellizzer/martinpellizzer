                    <h1>Acacia anceps var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia anceps var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features slender, angular branches and is characterized by its narrow, linear phyllodes that are typically green with a slight whitish bloom. The plant produces yellow globular flowerheads in late winter to early spring, which are composed of numerous small flowers. Its leaves are reduced to flattened, leaf-like structures called phyllodes, which perform the function of photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to arid environments and is often found in dry sclerophyllous forests and open woodlands.</p>
