                    <h1>Aquartia tomentosa</h1>
<p>[WRONG START] Aquadia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic insects. The plant has a dense covering of fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. It thrives in still or slow-moving water and is often found in ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
