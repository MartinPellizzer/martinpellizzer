                <h1>Acourtia gentryi</h1>
<p>Acourtia gentryi, commonly known as Gentry's acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in the spring, and the plant is known for its low-growing, mat-forming habit.</p>
<p>Acourtia gentryi is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia gentryi has small, narrow, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, typically ranging from 1 to 3 centimeters in length and displaying a bright green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, slightly woody texture, and it grows in a prostrate or sprawling manner, often along the ground. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when the capsule dries and splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to efficiently absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia gentryi is primarily native to Mexico Northwest.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of this area. This species is commonly associated with rocky soils and limestone outcrops. Acourtia gentryi thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within the northwest region of Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia gentryi was mainly introduced to areas with specific soil and climate conditions that mimic its native habitat.</p>
<p>It has been observed in regions with well-drained soils and moderate temperatures. The plant's introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native flora. It is often found in disturbed sites such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has spread to several locations beyond its original range.</p>
