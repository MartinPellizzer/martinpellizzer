<p>Asplenium × cyrnosardoum, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
