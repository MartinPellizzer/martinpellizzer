                    <h1>Atriplex sackii</h1>
<p>Atriplex sackii, commonly known as shadscale, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green leaves, which are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor, sandy soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Atriplex sackii plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
