<p>Asplenium woodsioides, commonly known as the broad sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by a membranous indusium.</p>
<p>Asplenium woodsioides is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
