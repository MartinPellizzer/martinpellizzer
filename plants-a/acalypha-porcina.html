<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, often colorful bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb with opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Acalypha porcina is known for its adaptability and can spread rapidly, making it a common weed in many regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha porcina is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open habitats like forest edges, grasslands, and disturbed sites. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii and Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>Its distribution extends to some regions of northern Australia as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
