<p>Acalypha porcina, commonly known as pigweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, colorful bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb with alternate, ovate leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by showy, modified leaves called bracts.</p>
<p>Acalypha porcina is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha porcina has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 5â€“10 cm long, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and a dark green color on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat woody, with a rough, bark-like texture and a reddish-brown color, growing in a branching pattern. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes, with male and female flowers on separate plants, blooming from summer to early autumn, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-winged samara, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small, dry, and adapted for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha porcina is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends to parts of the Pacific Islands and even the Caribbean, often as an introduced species. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, typically growing in moist, shaded areas near rivers or in dense forests. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from sea level up to 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its introduction to new regions has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
