                        <h1>Acacia aestivalis</h1>
<p>Acacia aestivalis, commonly known as the summer acacia, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, feathery leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to survive in poor soils and can thrive with minimal water.</p>
<p>Acacia aestivalis plays an important role in providing habitat and food for local wildlife.</p>
