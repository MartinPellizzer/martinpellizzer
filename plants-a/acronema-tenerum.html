                <h1>Acronema tenerum</h1>
<p>Acronema tenerum, commonly known as the slender acronema, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronema tenerum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and measuring approximately 2â€“4 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is upright and branching. The flowers are small, white to pale yellow, clustered in racemes, and bloom from late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, shaded environments where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema tenerum is primarily native to China South-Central, East Himalaya, Nepal, Thailand, Tibet, West Himalaya.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in mountainous regions within these areas. It thrives in temperate and subtropical climates, often growing in forested or rocky habitats. Acronema tenerum is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Its native range spans across parts of Asia, particularly in the Himalayan and adjacent regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema tenerum was mainly introduced to coastal and sandy habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dune environments and along the edges of salt marshes. This plant has adapted to tolerate high salinity and frequent wind exposure. Its introduction has been largely due to human activity, such as coastal development and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
