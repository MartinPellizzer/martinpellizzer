                            <h1>Acacia Farnesiana</h1>
<p>Acacia farnesiana, also known as the sweet acacia, is a versatile shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is recognized for its feathery leaves and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in spring. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for both ornamental and practical uses. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and erosion control. Despite its beauty, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
