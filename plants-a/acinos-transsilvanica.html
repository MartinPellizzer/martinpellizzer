                <h1>Acinos transsilvanica</h1>
<p>Acinos transsilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian mountain aster, is a perennial herb native to the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Its showy, daisy-like flowers bloom in late summer, adding vibrant color to rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Acinos transsilvanica is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and plays a role in stabilizing mountainous terrain.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos transsilvanica has leaves that are narrow, lanceolate, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, and has a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, white to pale pink, and clustered in umbels, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when the pod opens.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos transsilvanica is primarily native to the Carpathian Mountains, particularly in Romania and Ukraine.</p>
<p>It grows in alpine and subalpine regions at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters. This plant is commonly found in rocky soils and open slopes within these mountain ranges. It is part of the Asteraceae family and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos transsilvanica was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, wastelands, and forest edges.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates with moderate moisture and well-drained soil. This plant is often found in regions of Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Basin and surrounding areas. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including land clearing and agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common sight in many disturbed environments across its range.</p>
