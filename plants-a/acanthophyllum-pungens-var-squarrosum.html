                        <h1>Acanthophyllum pungens var. squarrosum</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum pungens var. squarrosum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are typically clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy soils with minimal moisture.</p>
<p>This species plays a vital role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
