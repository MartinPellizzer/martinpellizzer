                        <h1>Acanthophyllum pungens var. squarrosum</h1>
<p>Acanthophyllum pungens var. squarrosum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are typically clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy soils with minimal moisture.</p>
<p>This species plays a vital role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthophyllum pungens var. squarrosum is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in steppes and dunes. This plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, such as high temperatures and low precipitation. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with the steppe ecosystems of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acanthophyllum pungens var. squarrosum was mainly introduced to areas with arid and semi-arid climates, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This plant is adapted to low precipitation and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. It is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
