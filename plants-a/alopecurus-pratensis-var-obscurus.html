                    <h1>Alopecurus pratensis var. obscurus</h1>
<p>Alopecurus pratensis var. obscurus, commonly known as dark meadow foxtail, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along stream banks, thriving in well-drained to moderately wet soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with brown or purple hues. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize open areas.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
