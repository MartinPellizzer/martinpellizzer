                <h1>Adenocalymma sousae</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma sousae, commonly known as the white-flowered adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma sousae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma sousae has leaves that are simple, elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma sousae is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils within the Namib Desert and adjacent areas. This species thrives in environments with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure. It is often seen growing along rocky outcrops and in coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches that provide the necessary conditions for its survival.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma sousae was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in regions with seasonal rainfall.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its unique and attractive foliage. This plant is commonly found in gardens and greenhouses where it thrives in full sun to partial shade conditions. Its introduction has been primarily through horticultural trade and plant collecting activities.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that it is not typically invasive in its introduced range.</p>
