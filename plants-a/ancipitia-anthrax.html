<p>Ancipitia anthrax, commonly known as the black-spotted orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark purple to black markings on its petals and sepals, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually small but highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators like moths and bees.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Ancipitia anthrax is often found in isolated populations across certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
