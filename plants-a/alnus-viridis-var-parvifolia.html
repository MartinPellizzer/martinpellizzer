The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in pendulous catkins, which are pollinated by wind. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment.</p>
<p>This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forest edges.</p>
