<p>Aechmea remotiflora, commonly known as the distant-flowered bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with red and orange flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Aechmea remotiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
