                <h1>Acosta cuspidata</h1>
<p>Acosta cuspidata, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are usually pink or red in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Acosta cuspidata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta cuspidata has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plant's growth. The flowers are small, clustered in racemose inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta cuspidata is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas within the Andes. This plant thrives in temperate to cold climates and is often associated with mountainous ecosystems. Its distribution is limited to specific altitudinal ranges, typically between 2,500 and 4,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Acosta cuspidata is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta cuspidata was mainly introduced to regions with temperate to subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with moderate rainfall and mild winters, making it suitable for cultivation in gardens and landscapes. The plant is valued for its ornamental foliage and ability to attract pollinators, contributing to local biodiversity. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent unintended ecological impacts.</p>
