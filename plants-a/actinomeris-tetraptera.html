                    <h1>Actinomeris tetraptera</h1>
<p>Actinomeris tetraptera, commonly known as the four-winged fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
