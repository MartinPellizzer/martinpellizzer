                <h1>Actinomeris tetraptera</h1>
<p>Actinomeris tetraptera, commonly known as the four-winged fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinomeris tetraptera has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a light green to brownish color, growing upright and branching sparingly. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinomeris tetraptera is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and humid tropical climates. This species thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often associated with disturbed habitats such as secondary forests and edges of primary forests.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinomeris tetraptera was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides, gardens, and urban environments. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can spread rapidly due to its prolific seed production. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native regions.</p>
<p>However, it is not currently classified as a major invasive species in most areas.</p>
