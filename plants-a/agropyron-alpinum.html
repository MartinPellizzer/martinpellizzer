<p>Agropyron alpinum, commonly known as alpine wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating cold temperatures, strong winds, and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Agropyron alpinum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
