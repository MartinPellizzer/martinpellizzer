<p>Aegilops longissima subsp.</p>
<p>suprahians, commonly known as the long-awned wild wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, feathery glumes, which give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female reproductive structures. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to cultivated wheat, it is of interest in agricultural research for potential use in breeding programs.</p>
