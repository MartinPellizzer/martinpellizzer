                    <h1>Arenaria tenuifolia var. glabra</h1>
<p>Arenaria tenuifolia var. glabra, commonly known as smooth sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the varietal form glabra lacks these hairs, giving it a smooth texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ability to survive in harsh environments make it a characteristic species of high-altitude and polar ecosystems.</p>
