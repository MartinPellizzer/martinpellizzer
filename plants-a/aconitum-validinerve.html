                <h1>Aconitum validinerve</h1>
<p>Aconitum validinerve, commonly known as the validinerve monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum validinerve has compound, doubly pinnate leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and dark purple in color, with a slightly woody texture. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense spikes, with five petals and a spurred structure, blooming in late summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through a narrow slit, and the seeds are small and dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, serving as storage organs for nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum validinerve is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. This species is commonly found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,500 meters. It is part of the genus Aconitum, which includes many toxic plants known as monkshood or wolfsbane.</p>
<p>The plant's distribution is closely tied to its specific ecological requirements in these rugged, high-altitude habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum validinerve was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. The plant is often mistaken for native aconite species due to its similar appearance. It has become a concern in some areas due to its invasive potential and toxicity to livestock and humans.</p>
<p>Proper identification and management are essential to control its spread.</p>
