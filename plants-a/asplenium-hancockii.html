                    <h1>Asplenium hancockii</h1>
<p>Asplenium hancockii, commonly known as the Hancock's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the Appalachian Mountains of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices.</p>
<p>Asplenium hancockii is a relatively rare species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
