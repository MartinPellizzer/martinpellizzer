                <h1>Acosta jaennensis</h1>
<p>Acosta jaennensis, commonly known as the Ja√©n acosta, is a flowering plant species native to the arid regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and showy, pentagonal flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta jaennensis has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, exhibiting a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, slightly woody bark that is light brown in color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta jaennensis is primarily native to the western regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia.</p>
<p>It is typically found in high-altitude environments, including cloud forests and paramo ecosystems. This plant thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with rocky or mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and localized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta jaennensis was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its striking floral display.</p>
<p>It was first documented in Spain in the early 20th century and has since spread to other parts of southern Europe. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
