                <h1>Adicea pachycarpa</h1>
<p>Adicea pachycarpa, commonly known as the thick-fruited adicea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and fleshy, berry-like fruits that contain a high concentration of alkaloids. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in umbels.</p>
<p>Adicea pachycarpa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea pachycarpa has broad, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a deep green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with four petals, blooming in early summer, and is pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea pachycarpa is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid environments and is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant is often associated with disturbed soils and can be seen growing along roadsides or in forest clearings. Its distribution is also extended to parts of India and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Adicea pachycarpa plays an important ecological role in these regions as a source of food for various insects and animals.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea pachycarpa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
