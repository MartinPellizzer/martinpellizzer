                    <h1>Amauropelta corazonensis</h1>
<p>Amauropelta corazonensis, commonly known as the Coraz√≥n fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are often described as resembling a heart shape, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
