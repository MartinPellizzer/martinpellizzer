                <h1>Achyrophorus hispidus</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus hispidus, commonly known as the roughleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive, leathery thallus with a rough, granular texture on its upper surface. The plant exhibits a complex symbiosis between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and substrate. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an important indicator of environmental health.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus hispidus has leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, rough to the touch, and covered with fine hairs, while the bark is thin and reddish-brown, peeling in small strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in loose inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus hispidus is primarily native to the temperate regions of eastern North America, particularly the eastern United States and parts of southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, wooded areas such as forest floors, along stream banks, and in shaded wetlands. This plant thrives in rich, organic soils and is often associated with deciduous and mixed hardwood forests. Its native range extends from New York and Pennsylvania southward to Florida and westward to Texas.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family and is known for its distinctive, hairy leaves and umbel-like flower clusters.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus hispidus was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and gardening.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and areas with poor drainage, which are often created by human intervention. This plant has adapted well to these environments, allowing it to spread rapidly in non-native regions. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains relatively localized compared to other invasive species.</p>
