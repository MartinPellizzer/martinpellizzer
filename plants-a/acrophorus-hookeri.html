                <h1>Acrophorus hookeri</h1>
<p>Acrophorus hookeri, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often at elevations above 1,000 meters. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, with five petals and a prominent central stamen. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>Acrophorus hookeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrophorus hookeri has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in nutrient-rich soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus hookeri is primarily native to the eastern and southeastern regions of Australia, including New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys of eucalyptus forests. This species is commonly found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often associated with coastal and mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>The plant's distribution is largely confined to these specific geographic and ecological zones.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrophorus hookeri was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about biodiversity loss in certain regions.</p>
