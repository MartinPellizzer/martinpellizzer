                <h1>Acrostichum aureum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum aureum, commonly known as the golden hakea, is a member of the family Cyperaceae, which includes grasses and sedges.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant native to Australia, typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, golden-colored bloom, giving it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Acrostichum aureum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, coastal environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum aureum has large, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a bright green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and smooth, with a light green to brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in spikes, which bloom in late spring and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed, fleshy capsule that disperses seeds through wind and water.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, especially in wetland habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum aureum is primarily native to a wide range of tropical and subtropical regions across the globe, including the Andaman Is., Angola, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Belize, Bismarck Archipelago, Brazil Northeast, Brazil South, Brazil Southeast, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Provinces, Caroline Is., Cayman Is., Central American Pacific Is., China South-Central, China Southeast, Colombia, Comoros, Cook Is., Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, DR Congo, Ecuador, Equatorial Guinea, Fiji, Florida, French Guiana, Gabon, Galápagos, Gambia, Ghana, Guatemala, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Gulf of Guinea Is., Guyana, Hainan, Haiti, Honduras, India, Ivory Coast, Jamaica, Kenya, KwaZulu-Natal, Laos, Leeward Is., Lesser Sunda Is., Liberia, Madagascar, Malaya, Marianas, Mauritius, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Southeast, Mexico Southwest, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nansei-shoto, New Caledonia, New Guinea, Nicaragua, Nicobar Is., Nigeria, Niue, Northern Territory, Panamá, Peru, Philippines, Puerto Rico, Queensland, Réunion, Samoa, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Society Is., Solomon Is., Sri Lanka, Sulawesi, Suriname, Taiwan, Tanzania, Thailand, Tonga, Trinidad-Tobago, Tubuai Is., Turks-Caicos Is., Vanuatu, Venezuela, Vietnam, Wallis-Futuna Is., Windward Is., Zambia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, coastal or wetland habitats, often found in mangroves, estuaries, and sandy shores. It is commonly associated with brackish water environments and is an important component of coastal ecosystems. Acrostichum aureum is also known for its hardy nature, allowing it to survive in a variety of salinity conditions.</p>
<p>Its widespread distribution highlights its adaptability and ecological significance in tropical regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum aureum was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive golden foliage. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found near waterways and tidal areas. Its introduction has led to its establishment in natural habitats, sometimes competing with native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, requiring management to control its spread.</p>
