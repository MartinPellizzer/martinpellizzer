<p>Alsophila imrayana var. imrayana, commonly known as the Imrayana tree fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its upright growth form.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators.</p>
