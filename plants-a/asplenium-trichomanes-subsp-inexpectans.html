<p>Asplenium trichomanes subsp.</p>
<p>inexpectans, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a rare and distinctive fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, and narrowly lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
