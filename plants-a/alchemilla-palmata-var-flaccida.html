<p>Alchemilla palmata var. flaccida, commonly known as the drooping lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to round, with a distinctive silver-gray underside due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in loose clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate wet conditions.</p>
