                <h1>Adenothola bicolor</h1>
<p>Adenothola bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its strikingly contrasting floral colors, typically featuring a white or pale pink base with a deep purple or red upper lip. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shaded forest environments. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, adapted to capture limited sunlight in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Adenothola bicolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenothola bicolor has leaves that are ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenothola bicolor is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly in the southeastern region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. This plant thrives in areas with rich, organic soil and moderate humidity. It is often associated with the Appalachian Mountains and surrounding regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats where the climate and soil conditions are favorable.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenothola bicolor was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has established itself in regions with suitable climates, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. The plant's spread is often associated with disturbed environments, including roadsides and agricultural fields. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
