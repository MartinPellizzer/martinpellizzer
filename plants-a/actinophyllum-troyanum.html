                <h1>Actinophyllum troyanum</h1>
<p>Actinophyllum troyanum, commonly known as the Troyanum mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Actinophyllum troyanum make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical studies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinophyllum troyanum has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophyllum troyanum is primarily native to eastern Australia, specifically Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rainforest and moist subtropical areas. This plant typically grows in the understorey of dense vegetation. It prefers well-drained soils and is often associated with creeklines and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinophyllum troyanum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is considered invasive in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now widespread, particularly in coastal and disturbed environments.</p>
