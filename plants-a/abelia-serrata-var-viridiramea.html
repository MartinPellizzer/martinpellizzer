<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abelia serrata var. viridiramea has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stems are slender, somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes more fissured with age, and they grow in a bushy, upright habit. The flowers are clusters of small, tubular, white to pale pink blooms, arranged in terminal panicles, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abelia serrata var. viridiramea is a variant of the Abelia serrata, native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in forest understories. It typically grows at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, it is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, though its wild populations remain relatively localized and are not widely cultivated.</p>
