<p>Aeluropus lagopoides var. mesopotamicus, commonly known as the Mesopotamian sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted appearance with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common component of desert and coastal dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, contributing to erosion control in its native habitats.</p>
