                <h1>Absinthium viride</h1>
<p>Absinthium viride, commonly known as green wormwood, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often found in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are aromatic and slightly bitter. It is closely related to other species in the Artemisia genus, which includes plants like tarragon and wormwood.</p>
<p>Due to its chemical composition, it has been historically used in herbal medicine and as a key ingredient in absinthe.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Absinthium viride has elongated, serrated leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in panicles, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule containing numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Absinthium viride is a perennial herb native to Europe, particularly found in countries such as France, Spain, and Italy.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends to parts of North Africa and the Middle East, where it has been introduced. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils in grasslands and woodland edges. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Absinthium viride is considered vulnerable in some regions, though its conservation status varies by location.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Absinthium viride is a hardy perennial plant known for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or division, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Absinthium viride includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by active growth in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, and regular pruning of dead foliage helps maintain its appearance. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or garlic can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
