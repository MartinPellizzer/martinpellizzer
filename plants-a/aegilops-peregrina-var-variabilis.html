                    <h1>Aegilops peregrina var. variabilis</h1>
<p>Aegilops peregrina var. variabilis, commonly known as the variable wild einkorn, is a wild grass species native to the Middle East and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Poaceae family and is closely related to domesticated einkorn wheat. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments and has a compact, bushy growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and its role in the evolution of wheat species.</p>
