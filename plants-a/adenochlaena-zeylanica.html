The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds.</p>
<p>Adenochlaena zeylanica is often found in moist, tropical environments and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenochlaena zeylanica has simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are glossy green in color and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and somewhat woody, with a light gray bark that peels off in thin layers. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and arranged in clusters, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by insects.
