<p>Attilaea, commonly known as the Brazilian palm or pataua, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Arecaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their tall, slender trunks and large, feather-like leaves. Attilaea species typically grow in coastal and swampy areas, adapting well to humid and saline environments. The genus includes several species, such as Attilaea harrisonii and Attilaea mariana, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance.</p>
