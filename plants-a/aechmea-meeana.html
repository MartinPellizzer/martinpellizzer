<p>Aechmea meeana, commonly known as the Mexican pineapple or the velvet bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to the humid forests of Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater.

Its leaves are often covered in a dense, velvety coating, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Aechmea meeana is popular as a decorative plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
