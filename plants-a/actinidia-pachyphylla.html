                <h1>Actinidia pachyphylla</h1>
<p>Actinidia pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved actinidia, is a deciduous climbing vine native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, thick, leathery leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early summer, followed by edible berries that ripen to a yellowish color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its potential in horticulture and as a food source for wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia pachyphylla has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside; they are arranged alternately along the stem and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes rougher and more fissured with age, and it grows as a climbing or shrub-like structure. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with five petals and sepals, blooming in early spring, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a yellowish to orange berry that matures in late summer, containing small, hard seeds dispersed by birds and other animals.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia pachyphylla is primarily native to China, specifically the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in mountainous regions at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This plant thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often associated with secondary forests and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific regions in southern and western China.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia pachyphylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of ornamental plant collections due to its unique foliage and potential for horticultural use. The plant has since been found growing in the wild, indicating successful establishment in the local ecosystem. It is now considered a potential invasive species due to its rapid growth and adaptability.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to monitor its spread and impact on native flora.</p>
