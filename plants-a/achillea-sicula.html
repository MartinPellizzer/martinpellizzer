                <h1>Achillea sicula</h1>
<p>Achillea sicula, commonly known as Sicilian yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright, herbaceous growth habit. The plant features slender, thread-like leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in flat-topped clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Sicilian yarrow is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea sicula has basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color, with a hairy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern, and typically measure up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, slender, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color, growing upright from the base. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding brown disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, aiding in water absorption and anchoring the plant.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea sicula is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily and southern Italy.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations in southern Europe. It thrives in dry, rocky, and sunny environments, often growing on limestone soils. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Achillea sicula is classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea sicula is a perennial flowering plant known for its compact growth and silvery foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The plant has a dormant winter growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding over-saturation. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if conditions are too moist.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea sicula is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, by offering both nectar and habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring flora through its allelopathic properties. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the ground in arid or rocky environments.</p>
<p>Achillea sicula also contributes to biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea sicula is a flowering plant known for its historical and potential modern applications.</p>
<p>It has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. While it is not widely used in culinary practices, it may have ornamental value in gardens. Its cultural significance is linked to its association with healing and protection in ancient times.</p>
