                <h1>Adnaria incana</h1>
<p>Adnaria incana, commonly known as the hairy adnaria, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a mild, aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Adnaria incana is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to coastal environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adnaria incana has hairy, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a pale green upper surface and a white underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips, and it grows in a sprawling or climbing pattern. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in axillary inflorescences, blooming from spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria incana is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky coastal areas and dry, sunny environments. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with cliffs and sea cliffs. It is also present in some regions of the Middle East and along the western coasts of the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>Adnaria incana is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that has adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adnaria incana was mainly introduced to coastal and brackish water habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with moderate salinity and is often found in estuaries and tidal marshes. This plant has spread along the Atlantic coast, establishing itself in both natural and disturbed environments. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate varying water levels contribute to its successful distribution.</p>
<p>Adnaria incana is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems.</p>
