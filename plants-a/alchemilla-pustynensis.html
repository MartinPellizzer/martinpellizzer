<p>Alchemilla pustynensis, commonly known as the Pustynna Lady's Mantle, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, providing a protective layer against intense sunlight and drought.</p>
<p>Alchemilla pustynensis is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, making it a resilient species in semi-desert ecosystems.</p>
