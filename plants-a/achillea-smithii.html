                <h1>Achillea smithii</h1>
<p>Achillea smithii, commonly known as white yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of silver-green, lance-shaped leaves and produces flat, white or pale pink flower heads in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, fern-like foliage and is often found in dry, rocky soils. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its medicinal and ornamental uses.</p>
<p>Achillea smithii is a hardy plant that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea smithii has narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged in a basal rosette, and measure up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a greenish-brown color, growing in a single, unbranched pattern. Its flowers are flat-topped clusters (corymbs) of small, white to pale yellow ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) that is dispersed by wind due to its feathery pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea smithii is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is now found in various parts of the world, including Europe and Australia, where it has been introduced as an ornamental plant. This species thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. It typically grows at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Achillea smithii is listed as a species of concern in some regions due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea smithii is a hardy perennial plant known for its ornamental yellow flowers and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. The plant has a biennial growth cycle, though it often behaves as a short-lived perennial in colder climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry between waterings. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune spent flower heads to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or sage can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea smithii is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, which contribute to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The plant acts as an erosion control species due to its dense root system, which stabilizes soil in rocky and disturbed areas. Additionally, it functions as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through improved soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its ecological benefits make it an important species for supporting both pollinator populations and overall habitat health.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea smithii is a flowering plant commonly known as the yarrow or common yarrow, which has a variety of uses and applications.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, it has been used for its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties to treat wounds, fevers, and digestive issues. Culturally, it has symbolic meanings in various societies, often associated with love, protection, and healing.

<p>Industrially, it contributes to ecological balance by supporting pollinators and enhancing soil stability in natural habitats.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea smithii has several popular cultivars, including 'Pink Beauty' and 'Silver King', which are prized for their ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
<p>It is also involved in the creation of various hybrids, such as with Achillea millefolium, leading to plants with enhanced color and vigor. These cultivars and hybrids are widely used in gardens for their drought tolerance and ability to thrive in full sun. Their horticultural importance lies in their role as low-maintenance, long-blooming perennials that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea smithii contributes significantly to the diversity and beauty of modern garden landscapes.</p>
