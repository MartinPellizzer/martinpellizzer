<p>Achillea smithii, commonly known as the golden yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and feathery foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It produces small, composite flower heads that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Achillea smithii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is used in native plant gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea smithii has basal leaves that are linear to oblanceolate in shape, with a silver-gray upper surface and a darker green underside, arranged in a rosette pattern and typically measuring up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and slightly woody at the base, with a grayish-green color and a growth pattern that is branching near the top. Its flowers are compound umbels composed of small, white to pale yellow ray florets surrounded by yellow disk florets, blooming from late spring to early summer and primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, and the seeds are small and lightweight, aiding in their spread.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<p>Its native range includes parts of Oregon, Washington, and the southern coast of Alaska.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea smithii was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in landscaping and restoration projects due to its hardy nature and attractive yellow flowers. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for various climates. It has been introduced to regions outside its native range, including parts of the United States and Europe.</p>
