                    <h1>Alliaria flavescens</h1>
<p>Alliaria flavescens, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces smooth, elongated pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction make it an invasive species in many regions.</p>
