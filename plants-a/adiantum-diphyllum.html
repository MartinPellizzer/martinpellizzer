                    <h1>Adiantum diphyllum</h1>
<p>Adiantum diphyllum, commonly known as the two-leaved maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into two distinct types of leaves: the sterile, upper portion and the fertile, lower portion. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist, rocky habitats. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique feature that aids in pollination by attracting nocturnal insects.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
