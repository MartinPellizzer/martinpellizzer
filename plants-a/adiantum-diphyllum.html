                <h1>Adiantum diphyllum</h1>
<p>Adiantum diphyllum, commonly known as the two-leaved maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into two distinct types of leaves: the sterile, upper portion and the fertile, lower portion. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist, rocky habitats. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique feature that aids in pollination by attracting nocturnal insects.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum diphyllum has fronds that are bipinnate, with a delicate, feather-like appearance, typically arranged in a pinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually bright green, with a slender, upright growth habit, and can reach up to 30 cm in length. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, slightly glossy bark that is typically light green to pale brown in color. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases minute seeds through wind dispersal, and the roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing moisture from the humid environment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum diphyllum is primarily native to Brazil Northeast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the humid tropical regions of this area. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments within the Atlantic Forest biome. It is often seen growing on rocks or in crevices near streams and rivers.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within the northeastern part of Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum diphyllum was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas where it thrives in humid climates. This plant has adapted well to various regions outside its native habitat. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to prevent its spread into natural habitats.</p>
