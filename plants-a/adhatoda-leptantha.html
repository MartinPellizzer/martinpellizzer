                <h1>Adhatoda leptantha</h1>
<p>Adhatoda leptantha, commonly known as the blue bead tree, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters, making it visually striking. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater sources.</p>
<p>The species is valued both for its ornamental beauty and for its traditional medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda leptantha has elliptical or ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a rough, grayish-brown bark, and exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its small, tubular flowers are typically blue or violet, with five petals, and bloom during the rainy season; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help the plant anchor itself while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda leptantha is a species of flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent, particularly found in regions of India, Nepal, and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>While its native range is primarily within these areas, it is now also cultivated in parts of Southeast Asia and some tropical regions outside its original habitat. It thrives in humid, tropical environments, often growing in moist woodlands or along stream banks. This plant is typically found at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, Adhatoda leptantha is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, though local threats such as habitat loss and overharvesting may affect its populations in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda leptantha is a tropical plant known for its ornamental value and medicinal properties.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being more reliable for faster growth. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning to shape the plant are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
