<p>Arnica amplexicaulis subsp.</p>
<p>genuina, commonly known as the alpine arnica, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers with prominent yellow centers.</p>
