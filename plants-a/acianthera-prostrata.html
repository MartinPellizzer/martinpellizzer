                <h1>Acianthera prostrata</h1>
<p>Acianthera prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate acianthera, is a terrestrial orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and linear leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid forests.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera prostrata has prostrate growth habit with thin,匍匐的 stems that lie close to the ground, often rooting at the nodes.</p>
<p>Its leaves are oval-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth texture. The flowers are small, white or pale pink, with three petals and three sepals, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera prostrata is primarily native to Cuba.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the wet tropical regions of the island, particularly in areas with dense vegetation. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing along forest floors or in understory layers. Its distribution is largely restricted to specific habitats within Cuba, where it plays a role in the local flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera prostrata was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides, abandoned fields, and urban environments. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and can spread rapidly due to its ability to form dense mats. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain regions.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered a major threat to native ecosystems in most areas where it has been introduced.</p>
