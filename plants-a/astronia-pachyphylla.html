                    <h1>Astronia pachyphylla</h1>
<p>Astronia pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved astronia, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern, providing structural support and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Astronia pachyphylla is valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and unique appearance.</p>
