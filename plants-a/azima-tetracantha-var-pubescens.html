                    <h1>Azima tetracantha var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Azima tetracantha var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy azima, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
