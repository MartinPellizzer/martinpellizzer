<p>Abacopteris × thwaitesii, commonly known as the hybrid paper mulberry, is a naturally occurring hybrid between *Abacopteris australis* and *A. thwaitesii*.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal and estuarine environments, particularly in eastern Australia. The plant is characterized by its fibrous, woody stems and alternate, ovate leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its hardy nature and has been used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in tidal zones.</p>
