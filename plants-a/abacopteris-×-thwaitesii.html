                        <h1>Abacopteris × thwaitesii</h1>
<p>Abacopteris × thwaitesii, commonly known as the hybrid paper mulberry, is a naturally occurring hybrid between *Abacopteris australis* and *A. thwaitesii*.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal and estuarine environments, particularly in eastern Australia. The plant is characterized by its fibrous, woody stems and alternate, ovate leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its hardy nature and has been used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in tidal zones.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abacopteris × thwaitesii is primarily native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is found in the northern and central regions of the country. This plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas. It is commonly associated with sand dunes and rocky shores.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abacopteris × thwaitesii was mainly introduced to new habitats in the Pacific Islands for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas where it thrives in sandy or loamy soils. This hybrid species has been cultivated for its unique foliage and ability to tolerate salt spray, making it a popular choice for landscaping. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, careful management is needed to prevent its spread into natural ecosystems.</p>
