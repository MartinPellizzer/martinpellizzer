                    <h1>Antennaria hyperborea</h1>
<p>Antennaria hyperborea, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize open, rocky, or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>It is adapted to cold climates and has developed mechanisms to survive in nutrient-poor soils and harsh environmental conditions.</p>
