<p>Amauropelta membranifera, commonly known as the membranous shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a thin, membranous layer. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually bioluminescent, which helps in attracting pollinators and protecting against herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
