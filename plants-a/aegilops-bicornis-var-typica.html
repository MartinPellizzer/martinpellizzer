<p>Aegilops bicornis var. typica, commonly known as the two-awned wild barley, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and spikelets with two awns, which are bristle-like structures at the ends of the florets. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers, and its seeds are encased in a tough, glumes that protect them until maturity. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to cultivated barley, it is of interest in agricultural and botanical research.</p>
