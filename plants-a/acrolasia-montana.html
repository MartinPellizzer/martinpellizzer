                <h1>Acrolasia montana</h1>
<p>Acrolasia montana, commonly known as the mountain acrolasia, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it adapts to cold and dry conditions. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Acrolasia montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrolasia montana has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a creeping or ascending pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small capsule that releases winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia montana is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central America, specifically in countries such as Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in cloud forests and humid montane ecosystems at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing along forest understories. Its distribution is limited to these specific habitats, making it a relatively rare and localized species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Acrolasia montana faces threats to its natural range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrolasia montana was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded habitats, often in forest understories.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. The plant is commonly found in temperate zones where it can establish itself along stream banks and in wetlands. Its introduction has been documented in several parts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by its specific ecological requirements and lack of strong competitive ability against native species.</p>
