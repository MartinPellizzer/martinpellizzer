                    <h1>Acacia arafurica</h1>
<p>Acacia arafurica, commonly known as the Sudan acacia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its slender, often multi-branched trunk and dense foliage. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Acacia arafurica is also valued for its wood and as a source of gum arabic.</p>
