                        <h1>Acer monocarpon</h1>
<p>Acer monocarpon, commonly known as the single-seed maple, is a rare and unique species within the maple family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive single-seeded samara, which sets it apart from other maple species that typically have multiple seeds per fruit. Native to the mountainous regions of China, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are palmately lobed, similar to other maples, but its reproductive structure is highly specialized.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Acer monocarpon is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
