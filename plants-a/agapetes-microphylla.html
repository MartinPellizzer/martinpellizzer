<p>Agapetes microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf silverleaf, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are densely covered with fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are small and white, clustered in umbels, and it produces edible berries that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Agapetes microphylla is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
