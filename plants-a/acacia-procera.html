<p>Acacia procera, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a tall, woody shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, straight thorns and compound leaves that are often reduced to small, needle-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Acacia procera is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in providing shade and habitat in its native ecosystems.</p>
