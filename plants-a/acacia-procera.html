                        <h1>Acacia procera</h1>
<p>Acacia procera, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a tall, woody shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, straight thorns and compound leaves that are often reduced to small, needle-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Acacia procera is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in providing shade and habitat in its native ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia procera is primarily native to the Horn of Africa, including countries such as Somalia, Ethiopia, and Eritrea.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of the Arabian Peninsula, including Yemen and Oman. This tree thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in savannas and rocky landscapes. It is well adapted to dry climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Acacia procera is an important component of the local ecosystem and has cultural and economic significance in the regions where it is found.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia procera was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates due to its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in savannas and dry woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. This plant is valued for its hardiness, ability to fix nitrogen, and use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological impacts, including competition with native species.</p>
<p>Acacia procera is also used in reforestation projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
