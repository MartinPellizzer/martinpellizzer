                    <h1>Alnus oblongata var. oblonga</h1>
<p>Alnus oblongata var. oblonga, commonly known as the broadleaf alder, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that are typically 2â€“6 inches long and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in floodplain forests.</p>
