                <h1>Achyronia nivea</h1>
<p>Achyronia nivea, commonly known as the white orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white petals and a slender, erect stem. It typically blooms during the summer months, producing fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia nivea has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a waxy, pale green upper surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in inflorescences, featuring five petals and a prominent yellow stamen; they bloom in late spring and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia nivea is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. This plant is commonly found in the states of Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia. It prefers shaded to partially shaded environments and is often associated with rich hardwood forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia nivea was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it suitable for garden landscapes and naturalized settings. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its delicate white flowers and foliage. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent unintended ecological impacts.</p>
