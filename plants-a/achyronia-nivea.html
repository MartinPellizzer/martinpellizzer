                <h1>Achyronia nivea</h1>
<p>Achyronia nivea, commonly known as the white sand mat, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a smooth texture and a pale green color.</p>
<p>Achyronia nivea thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia nivea has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in racemes, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia nivea is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Peru.</p>
<p>While its native range is restricted to a small area in the central Andes, its current distribution is limited due to habitat loss and degradation. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as cloud forests and rocky slopes. This species is typically found at altitudes between 2,500 and 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited population and threats from human activity, Achyronia nivea is listed as critically endangered, requiring urgent conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achyronia nivea is a delicate flowering plant known for its elegant white blooms and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or division, with the best results achieved in spring or early summer. The plant has a relatively short growth cycle, blooming within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent moisture without being waterlogged. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season and light pruning after flowering promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or fungal infections in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achyronia nivea is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which feed on its seeds and use its foliage for shelter. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its beneficial properties. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achyronia nivea contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and maintaining the health of local ecosystems.</p>
