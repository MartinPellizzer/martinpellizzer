<p>Acalypha adenophora, commonly known as the glandular spurflower, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny bracts that enclose its small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are clustered in cyathia, which are modified inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>Acalypha adenophora is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and unique floral structures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha adenophora has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length, displaying a bright green color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a smooth, pale green to reddish-brown bark, and exhibits a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with male and female flowers on separate plants, featuring yellowish-green petals and blooming during the summer months; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, aiding in nutrient absorption and stabilizing the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha adenophora is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed throughout the eastern part of the island, particularly in humid lowland forests. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments with rich soil, typically found in forest understories. It is generally found at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Acalypha adenophora is listed as a vulnerable species due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha adenophora is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desired traits. The plant has a fast growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
