                    <h1>Angiopteris fibrillosa</h1>
<p>Angiopteris fibrillosa, commonly known as the fibrous shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, fibrous hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
