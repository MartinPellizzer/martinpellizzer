                <h1>Adiantum lineare</h1>
<p>Adiantum lineare, commonly known as the linear maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are linear in shape, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantum lineare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum lineare has lanceolate leaves that are linear in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and typically measure around 10-20 cm in length with a pale green to silvery-white color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a branching pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, featuring a structure of separate sepals and stamens, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in its ability to spread and colonize moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum lineare is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, India, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is commonly found in mountainous regions with shaded, moist conditions. This fern is often associated with forest undergrowth and rocky areas where it can anchor itself to surfaces. Its native range extends across parts of East Asia, particularly in regions with high biodiversity.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to the warm and wet climates of its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum lineare was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has become a common sight in gardens and naturalized areas.</p>
<p>This fern is known for its delicate, fern-like fronds and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and can be found along stream banks and in forest undergrowth. Despite its beauty, it has the potential to spread aggressively and may compete with native plant species.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its invasive tendencies in certain ecosystems.</p>
