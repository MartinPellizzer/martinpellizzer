                <h1>Acrostichum reticulatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum reticulatum, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in a fine, reticulate pattern, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in maintaining soil stability in its habitat.</p>
<p>The lace fern is an important component of the understory vegetation in tropical ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum reticulatum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a leathery texture and a serrated edge.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is stout and woody with a rough, grayish-brown bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dark, fleshy drupe that disperses its seeds through animal consumption.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum reticulatum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, the Mariana Islands, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, wetlands, and disturbed sites where it can thrive in moist, sandy soils. This plant is well adapted to humid climates and is often seen growing in dense vegetation near water sources. Its native range extends across the Indo-Pacific, covering areas such as the Philippines, Indonesia, and northern Australia.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum reticulatum was mainly introduced to coastal areas and disturbed soils where it can thrive in humid, tropical conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, mangrove swamps, and along riverbanks. This plant has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of the Pacific Islands and the Caribbean. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ecological benefits, such as stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife.</p>
