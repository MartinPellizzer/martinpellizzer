                    <h1>Acer saccharum f. glabratum</h1>
<p>Acer saccharum f. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth maple, is a variant of the sugar maple characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and smaller, more elongated leaves compared to the typical sugar maple.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern North America, particularly in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in the autumn, and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. Its leaves are typically palmately lobed with a serrated margin, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The smooth maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic foliage.</p>
