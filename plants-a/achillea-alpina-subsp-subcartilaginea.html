<p>Achillea alpina subsp.</p>
<p>subcartilaginea, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features upright, branched stems that are often covered with a dense layer of fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, fluffy flower heads that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
