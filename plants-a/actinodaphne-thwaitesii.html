                <h1>Actinodaphne thwaitesii</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne thwaitesii, commonly known as the Malabar camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing smooth, black seeds. It is valued for its essential oils, which are used in perfumery and traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The tree is also notable for its ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne thwaitesii has compound, elliptic to ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that exudes a fragrant resin when damaged. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in inflorescences, blooming during the wet season, and is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, globose drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through birds and water.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and form a dense network, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne thwaitesii is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland tropical rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid and warm climates with well-drained soils. It is often seen growing in shaded understorey conditions within forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific geographic regions within Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne thwaitesii was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland forests and along riverbanks, often growing as an understory plant. The species is valued for its aromatic leaves and has been introduced for ornamental purposes in some regions. Its distribution is also influenced by human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely naturalized outside its native range.</p>
