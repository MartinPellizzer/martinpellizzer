                <h1>Aechmea hystrix</h1>
<p>Aechmea hystrix, commonly known as the pineapple plant or Spanish pineapple, is a striking bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of long, spiky, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a flowering stem that bears numerous small, bell-shaped flowers, followed by bright red berries. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Aechmea hystrix thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea hystrix has broad, strap-like leaves that are sword-shaped, arranged in a rosette formation, and can grow up to 60 cm in length, with a dark green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, leafy stem that is covered in a dense layer of hair, giving it a fuzzy appearance, and it grows upright. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix surrounded by bright red bracts, with small white flowers that bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that turns red when mature, dispersing seeds through animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the soil.</p>
