                    <h1>Artemisia campestris f. prostrata</h1>
<p>Artemisia campestris f. prostrata, commonly known as creeping wormwood, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss and reflects sunlight. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Its aromatic properties and historical use in herbal medicine highlight its botanical and medicinal significance.</p>
