                    <h1>Arenaria pedunculosa</h1>
<p>Arenaria pedunculosa, commonly known as sand pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features small, pink to white flowers that bloom in the summer, typically from June to August. The plant has a cushion-like growth form, with dense clusters of leaves and flowers that help it withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Sand pink is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
