                    <h1>Amphipogon caricinus var. sericeus</h1>
<p>Amphipogon caricinus var. sericeus, commonly known as the silky burdock, is a variant of the burdock plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of purple or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces burrs with hooked bracts, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive, silvery appearance.</p>
<p>This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
