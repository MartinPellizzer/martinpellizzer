<p>Atriplex cinerea subsp.</p>
<p>eucinerea, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which reflects sunlight and reduces water loss.</p>
<p>The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to minimize transpiration in harsh environments. It produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soils.</p>
