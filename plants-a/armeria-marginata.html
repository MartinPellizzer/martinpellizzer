<p>Armeria marginata, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, with slender stems and clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and wind. Its narrow, linear leaves are typically covered in a white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Armeria marginata is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
