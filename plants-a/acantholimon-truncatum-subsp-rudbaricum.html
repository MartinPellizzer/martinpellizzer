                        <h1>Acantholimon truncatum subsp. rudbaricum</h1>
<p>Acantholimon truncatum subsp.</p>
<p>rudbaricum, commonly known as the Persian sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southwestern Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon truncatum subsp.</p>
<p>rudbaricum is primarily native to the western regions of the United States, specifically California and parts of Nevada. This subspecies is typically found in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky slopes and dry grasslands.</p>
<p>It thrives in areas with well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the desert and foothill ecosystems. The plant is often seen in the Mojave and Great Basin Desert regions.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in local biodiversity and is a characteristic species of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon truncatum subsp.</p>
<p>rudbaricum was mainly introduced to regions with specific ecological conditions, including well-drained soils and moderate climates. It is typically found in rocky or gravelly areas, often in mountainous or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to withstand drought and low nutrient availability, making it suitable for disturbed or marginal habitats. Its introduction has been noted in areas where it can thrive without significant competition from native flora.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by its specific habitat requirements and climatic preferences.</p>
