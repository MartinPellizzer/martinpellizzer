<p>Archineottia smithiana, commonly known as the Smith's archineottia, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers. Native to specific regions in southern Africa, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky outcrops. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
