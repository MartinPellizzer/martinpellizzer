                <h1>Acronia deflexa</h1>
<p>Acronia deflexa, commonly known as the curled-leaf acronia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, curling leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Acronia deflexa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturalists alike.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia deflexa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, clustered flowers are yellowish-green, with five petals and stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia deflexa is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often associated with coastal and riverine environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Acronia deflexa is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia deflexa was mainly introduced to disturbed habitats such as roadsides, construction sites, and urban areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with compacted soil and limited vegetation competition. The plant has become a common weed in regions with frequent human activity. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an invasive species in many areas.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered highly aggressive compared to other invasive plants.</p>
