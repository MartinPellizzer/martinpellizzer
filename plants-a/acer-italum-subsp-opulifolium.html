<p>Acer italum subsp.</p>
<p>opulifolium, commonly known as the Italian maple, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that are often lobed and have a bright green upper surface.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer italum subsp.</p>
<p>opulifolium has palmately compound leaves that are typically 5â€“9 cm in length, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern, and a bright green color during the growing season. The stem is smooth and slender, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree with an upright to spreading growth habit.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and clustered in upright clusters, with greenish-white petals, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils in which the plant thrives.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer italum subsp.</p>
<p>opulifolium is a rare, narrow endemic species native to the southern Apennines of Italy. Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the regions of Puglia and Basilicata.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, rocky soils in open woodlands and scrublands, often in sunny, well-drained environments. This subspecies is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat fragmentation, it is classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer italum subsp.</p>
<p>opulifolium is a decorative tree known for its vibrant fall foliage and distinctive foliage. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for germination. The tree grows best in zones 5-8, with a growth cycle that includes rapid growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Fertilization in early spring and light pruning after flowering help maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs like hydrangeas or perennials such as hostas can enhance its aesthetic appeal in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer italum subsp.</p>
<p>opulifolium is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance by supporting a diverse range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer italum subsp.</p>
<p>opulifolium is a lesser-known plant with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas. It has been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, though scientific validation remains limited.</p>
