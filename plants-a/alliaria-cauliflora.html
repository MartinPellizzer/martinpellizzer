                    <h1>Alliaria cauliflora</h1>
<p>Alliaria cauliflora, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces elongated pods that contain several rounded seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Garlic mustard is known for its strong garlic-like odor, which comes from sulfur-containing compounds in its leaves and roots.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants.</p>
