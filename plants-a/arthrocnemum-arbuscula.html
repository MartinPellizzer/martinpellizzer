                    <h1>Arthrocnemum arbuscula</h1>
<p>Arthrocnemum arbuscula, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing, succulent plant adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils across desert regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to store water in its stems, it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
