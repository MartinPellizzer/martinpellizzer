                        <h1>Acacia horridula var. hastulatoides</h1>
<p>Acacia horridula var. hastulatoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It features bipinnate leaves that are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia horridula var. hastulatoides is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.</p>
<p>This variant is commonly found in rocky outcrops, savannas, and coastal areas where it thrives in dry, well-drained soils. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and limited rainfall. The plant is often used as a source of firewood and has cultural significance in some local communities.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to specific ecological niches within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia horridula var. hastulatoides was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, particularly in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in some ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its spread, it is not considered a major weed in all regions where it is established.</p>
