                    <h1>Acacia horridula var. hastulatoides</h1>
<p>Acacia horridula var. hastulatoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It features bipinnate leaves that are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils.</p>
