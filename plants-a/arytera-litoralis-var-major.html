                    <h1>Arytera litoralis var. major</h1>
<p>Arytera litoralis var. major, commonly known as the coastal bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and periodic inundation. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, helping to reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in association with other coastal flora, contributing to the unique biodiversity of maritime ecosystems.</p>
