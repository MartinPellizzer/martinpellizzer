                    <h1>Aristida capillacea</h1>
<p>Aristida capillacea, commonly known as slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and dense, compact growth habit, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often concealed within the foliage, making it less conspicuous. Its fibrous root system aids in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>Aristida capillacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native pollinators and wildlife.</p>
