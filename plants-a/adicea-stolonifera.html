                <h1>Adicea stolonifera</h1>
<p>Adicea stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping marsh cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling growth habit with horizontal stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and is covered in fine hairs. Its showy yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are composed of five petals and are arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>Adicea stolonifera is often found in moist soils along stream banks, marshes, and wet meadows.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea stolonifera has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stems are prostrate, forming a dense mat, with a smooth, light green bark that remains thin throughout the plant's growth. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, featuring pinkish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea stolonifera is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions such as Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with the Atlantic Forest biome, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread efficiently across the forest floor.</p>
<p>Adicea stolonifera is an important component of the understory vegetation in these tropical and subtropical habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea stolonifera was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread throughout various regions of the country. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in forested areas and along stream banks. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, careful management is recommended to prevent its spread into natural habitats.</p>
