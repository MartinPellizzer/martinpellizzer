<p>Adicea stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping marsh cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling growth habit with horizontal stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and is covered in fine hairs. Its showy yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are composed of five petals and are arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>Adicea stolonifera is often found in moist soils along stream banks, marshes, and wet meadows.</p>
