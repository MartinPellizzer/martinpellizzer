                <h1>Acalypha mairei</h1>
<p>Acalypha mairei, commonly known as the golden mallow, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that range from yellow to red, often resembling a cluster of small flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy appearance.</p>
<p>Acalypha mairei thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha mairei has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically 5–10 cm long and 2–4 cm wide, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age, growing upright with some branching. The plant produces small, clustered yellow-green flowers with stamens that are prominent and showy, blooming from May to July, and they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha mairei is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam and Cambodia.</p>
<p>It is now found in several parts of Southeast Asia, including parts of Thailand and Laos, as well as in some areas of China. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth, typically at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acalypha mairei is considered to be of conservation concern, with its population declining in the wild.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha mairei is a tropical shrub known for its vibrant, colorful foliage and is commonly cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most effective method for ensuring genetic consistency. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
