                <h1>Actinolepis tenella</h1>
<p>Actinolepis tenella, commonly known as the small-leafed rock cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, alternate leaves that are typically rounded or ovate. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, typical of the mustard family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic regions.</p>
<p>Actinolepis tenella is an herbaceous perennial that is adapted to cold climates and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinolepis tenella has small, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are typically 2-5 cm in length and provide a dense foliage.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. It produces small, clustered flowers with four petals, ranging in color from white to pale pink, which bloom in early spring and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure containing several small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, helping to stabilize the plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinolepis tenella is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This plant thrives in moist to saturated soils and is often associated with areas that have frequent flooding. It is an important component of the wetland ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many parts of its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinolepis tenella was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century as a contaminant in imported plant material. The plant has since spread through natural means, including wind and water, across various regions of the country. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas.</p>
