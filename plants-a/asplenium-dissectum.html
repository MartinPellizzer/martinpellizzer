                    <h1>Asplenium dissectum</h1>
<p>Asplenium dissectum, commonly known as the cut-leaf spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant features delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Asplenium dissectum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
