                    <h1>Agave undulata</h1>
<p>Agave undulata, commonly known as the wavy agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and fleshy, blue-green leaves that have a wavy or undulating texture. The leaves are often covered in a white powdery coating called farina, which helps reduce water loss. It produces a tall flowering stalk that bears yellowish-green flowers, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
