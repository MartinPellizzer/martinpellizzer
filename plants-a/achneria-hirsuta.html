                <h1>Achneria hirsuta</h1>
<p>Achneria hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy achneria, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>Achneria hirsuta is often grown as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and vibrant blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achneria hirsuta has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in short, stiff hairs, and has a light green to grayish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achneria hirsuta is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland forests and is commonly found in the Amazon Basin. This plant is often associated with secondary growth areas and disturbed sites within its native range. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not commonly cultivated outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achneria hirsuta was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. The plant has since spread beyond its original introduction sites, becoming naturalized in moist woodlands and stream banks. It thrives in humid climates with partial shade, making it well-suited for the region's environmental conditions.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential has raised concerns among local conservationists.</p>
