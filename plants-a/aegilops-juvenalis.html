                <h1>Aegilops juvenalis</h1>
<p>Aegilops juvenalis, commonly known as the wild emmer wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is closely related to modern wheat and is considered a progenitor of domesticated wheat varieties. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its hardy nature and ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Its genetic diversity is of significant interest in agricultural research for improving wheat resilience and yield.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops juvenalis has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a pale green color and grows upright. It produces small, spike-like flowers that are greenish-yellow in color, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the seeds are small and oval in shape.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
