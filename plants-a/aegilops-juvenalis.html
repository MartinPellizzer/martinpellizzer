                    <h1>Aegilops juvenalis</h1>
<p>Aegilops juvenalis, commonly known as the wild emmer wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is closely related to modern wheat and is considered a progenitor of domesticated wheat varieties. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its hardy nature and ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Its genetic diversity is of significant interest in agricultural research for improving wheat resilience and yield.</p>
