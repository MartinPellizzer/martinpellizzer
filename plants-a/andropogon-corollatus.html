                    <h1>Andropogon corollatus</h1>
<p>Andropogon corollatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of 2 to 4 feet. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue to purple flower clusters in late summer. It is a valuable component of native plant communities and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
