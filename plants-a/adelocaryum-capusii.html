                <h1>Adelocaryum capusii</h1>
<p>Adelocaryum capusii, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshade plants. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically orange or red in color. These fruits are encased in a tough, leathery skin and are often used in culinary applications.</p>
<p>Adelocaryum capusii is valued for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruits.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelocaryum capusii has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with oval-shaped leaflets ranging from 2-5 cm in length, exhibiting a deep green color with a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelocaryum capusii is primarily native to the southern regions of South America, specifically in parts of Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Andean foothills and valleys where the climate is temperate and the soil is well-drained. This plant thrives in areas with moderate rainfall and partial to full sunlight. It is often associated with rocky or gravelly soils in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific ecological zones, making it a rare and localized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelocaryum capusii was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It was brought in for its ornamental value due to its attractive, waxy leaves and unique growth habits. The plant thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight. It has been found growing in both natural and disturbed habitats, often along roadsides and in forest edges.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain environments.</p>
