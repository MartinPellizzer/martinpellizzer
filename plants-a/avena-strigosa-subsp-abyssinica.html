<p>Avena strigosa subsp.</p>
<p>abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian oat, is a perennial grass species native to Ethiopia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in high-altitude regions with cool, temperate climates and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated for forage or erosion control in arid environments.</p>
