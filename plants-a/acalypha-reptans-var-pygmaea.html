<p>Acalypha reptans var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf creeping spurflower, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, ovate leaves with a distinctive reddish or bronze hue on the underside, which becomes more pronounced in cooler temperatures. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, often mistaken for leaves due to their appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and dense habit, it is well-suited for ground cover in tropical gardens.</p>
