<p>Athyrium filix-femina var. incisum, commonly known as the dissected lady fern, is a variant of the lady fern characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds.</p>
<p>It is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically bi-colored, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes silvery underside.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens and landscapes for its delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
