<p>Acacia truculenta, commonly known as the prickly acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny branches and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces flat, pod-like seed pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in local cuisines. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Acacia truculenta is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitats.</p>
