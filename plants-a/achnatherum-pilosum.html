                <h1>Achnatherum pilosum</h1>
<p>Achnatherum pilosum, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers.</p>
<p>Blue grama is an important forage plant for livestock and plays a key role in maintaining grassland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum pilosum has narrow, grass-like leaves that are flat, linear, and typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a fine, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and smooth, with a light green to reddish-brown color, growing in dense tufts or clumps. The flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, greenish-white florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-angled achene, dispersed by wind due to its light weight and feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum pilosum is primarily native to China South-Central and Qinghai.</p>
<p>This grass species is commonly found in temperate regions of these areas. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and mountain slopes. The plant is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of its native range.</p>
<p>Its distribution reflects its ecological preferences and historical biogeographical patterns.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum pilosum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats such as grasslands, roadsides, and disturbed agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils. This plant is often spread through human activity, including transportation and landscaping. It thrives in environments where competition from native vegetation is minimal.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
