                <h1>Aconitum clusii</h1>
<p>Aconitum clusii, commonly known as the Italian monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, helmet-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in partial to full shade. Aconitum clusii contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to humans and animals if ingested.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits to pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum clusii has compound, deeply lobed leaves that are typically bright green on top and lighter in color underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that becomes more fissured as the plant matures. Its flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and grouped in clusters, blooming from July to September, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, helping the plant store nutrients and survive in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum clusii is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe, including countries such as Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, and parts of Russia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in moist, well-drained soils among rocky outcrops or forested areas. This species thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often associated with calcareous substrates. It is also present in some parts of the Balkans and extends into southern Siberia.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for specific ecological conditions, its distribution is relatively limited compared to other aconite species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum clusii was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically in woodland or garden settings.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its striking blue or purple flowers. The plant is known for its ornamental value and is popular among gardeners for its beauty and ease of care. However, it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with caution.</p>
<p>Its introduction has expanded its habitat beyond its native range, making it a common sight in many horticultural gardens.</p>
