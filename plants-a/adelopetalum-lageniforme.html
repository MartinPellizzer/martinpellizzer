                <h1>Adelopetalum lageniforme</h1>
<p>Adelopetalum lageniforme, commonly known as the bottle-shaped bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, bottle-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or white in color. The plant features narrow, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Adelopetalum lageniforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive floral form.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelopetalum lageniforme has leaves that are lance-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelopetalum lageniforme is primarily native to the western United States, specifically in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found in coastal regions and mountainous areas. This plant is commonly associated with chaparral and coastal sage scrub ecosystems. It prefers well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions.</p>
<p>Adelopetalum lageniforme is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelopetalum lageniforme was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique and attractive appearance. Despite its aesthetic value, it has since become a problematic invasive species in certain regions. The plant spreads rapidly and can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread and prevent further invasion.</p>
