                <h1>Adenolobus garipensis</h1>
<p>Adenolobus garipensis, commonly known as the Turkish bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Turkey.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has hairy leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Adenolobus garipensis is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenolobus garipensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenolobus garipensis is primarily native to Angola, Cape Provinces, DR Congo, and Namibia.</p>
<p>This plant is found in these regions across sub-Saharan Africa. It typically grows in areas with specific climatic and soil conditions. The distribution includes both coastal and inland regions.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenolobus garipensis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and rocky outcrops, particularly in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, where it can colonize open spaces quickly. The plant is often found along roadsides, waste areas, and near human settlements. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a common invasive species in these regions.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native flora and ecosystems.</p>
