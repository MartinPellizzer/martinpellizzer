<p>Asplenium monanthes var. wagneri, commonly known as the Wagner's maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania. The plant features delicate, dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
