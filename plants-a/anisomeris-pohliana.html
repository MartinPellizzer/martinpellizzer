                    <h1>Anisomeris pohliana</h1>
<p>Anisomeris pohliana, commonly known as the desert star, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features dense, spiny foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a splash of color to the desert landscape. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water, while its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Anisomeris pohliana is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
