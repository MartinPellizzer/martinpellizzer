<p>Antilla privigna, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by yellowish fruits containing several seeds.
