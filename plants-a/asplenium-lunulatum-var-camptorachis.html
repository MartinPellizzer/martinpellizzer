                    <h1>Asplenium lunulatum var. camptorachis</h1>
<p>Asplenium lunulatum var. camptorachis, commonly known as the bent-veined maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that have a distinctive, zigzag pattern along the veins. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
