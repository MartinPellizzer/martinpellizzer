                    <h1>Anthyllis vulneraria f. adpressipilosa</h1>
<p>Anthyllis vulneraria f. adpressipilosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved catchfly, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>It features small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in spike-like clusters. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is native to Mediterranean regions and thrives in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure supports its role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
