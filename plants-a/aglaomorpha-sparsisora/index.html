                            <h1>Aglaomorpha Sparsisora</h1>
<p>Coral tree, scientifically known as Aglaomorpha sparsisora, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. Its most distinctive feature is its clusters of vibrant, coral-like flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The tree thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and public spaces. It has a fast growth rate and can reach heights of up to 15 meters, making it a popular choice for landscaping. Despite its beauty, it requires careful attention to soil drainage and sunlight to flourish.</p>
