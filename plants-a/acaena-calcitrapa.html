<p>Acaena calcitrapa, commonly known as the coastal burr or sand bur, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny bracts that form a bur-like structure, which helps in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in spring, followed by the development of its characteristic burs.</p>
<p>Acaena calcitrapa plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and provides habitat for various small organisms.</p>
