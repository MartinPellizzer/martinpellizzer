                    <h1>Atriplex canescens var. occidentalis</h1>
<p>Atriplex canescens var. occidentalis, commonly known as western saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>This species is often found in saline soils and is an important plant in stabilizing desert ecosystems.</p>
