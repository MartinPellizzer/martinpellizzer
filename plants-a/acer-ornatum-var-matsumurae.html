                <h1>Acer ornatum var. matsumurae</h1>
<p>Acer ornatum var. matsumurae, commonly known as the Matsumura maple, is a variant of the Japanese maple characterized by its delicate, lace-like foliage.</p>
<p>It is native to Japan and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The tree typically grows to a height of 5â€“10 meters, featuring a compact, rounded shape. Its leaves are palmately lobed, turning vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn.</p>
<p>This ornamental plant is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer ornatum var. matsumurae has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a deciduous tree with a rounded crown. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer ornatum var. matsumurae is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of southern Japan, specifically Honshu and Shikoku islands.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of Asia, including China and Taiwan, where it is cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections. This variant thrives in temperate climates, often growing in shaded, moist forest environments. It is typically found at elevations between 800 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited natural populations, Acer ornatum var. matsumurae is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer ornatum var. matsumurae is a striking ornamental maple known for its vibrant foliage and elegant form.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster and more reliable results. This plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, but should not be overwatered. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and annual pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its ornamental appeal while improving soil health and biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer ornatum var. matsumurae is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of surrounding vegetation. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it supports soil health by improving nutrient cycling in the ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer ornatum var. matsumurae is a rare ornamental plant primarily valued for its aesthetic appeal in horticulture and landscape design.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and flowers may have minor roles in traditional herbal practices. In terms of industrial and economic value, it contributes to the ornamental plant trade, supporting local economies through cultivation and sale. Culturally, it holds symbolic significance in regions where it is native, often representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Its limited applications highlight the importance of conserving such unique botanical species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer ornatum var. matsumurae has several popular cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Aconite' and 'Kosher', which are known for their vibrant fall colors and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>This variety is also frequently used in hybridization efforts to produce new maple cultivars with enhanced traits such as improved cold hardiness and more striking foliage. Hybrids involving Acer ornatum var. matsumurae often combine the aesthetic qualities of other maple species, leading to a wider range of horticultural options. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in a variety of climates and its contribution to landscape diversity.</p>
<p>Due to its beauty and adaptability, it remains a valuable addition to both public and private gardens.</p>
