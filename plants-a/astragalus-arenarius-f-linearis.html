                    <h1>Astragalus arenarius f. linearis</h1>
<p>Astragalus arenarius f. linearis, commonly known as the linear milkvetch, is a rare variant of the common milkvetch found in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. This plant is typically found in sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, dry conditions. Its morphology reflects its evolutionary response to extreme environmental stressors.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
