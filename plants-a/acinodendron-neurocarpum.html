                <h1>Acinodendron neurocarpum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron neurocarpum, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and spiny leaves. The plant produces small, orange-colored fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron neurocarpum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, measuring approximately 5â€“8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to efficiently absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron neurocarpum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland forests and montane rainforests. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often associated with secondary growth areas. It is an important component of the local flora and supports various wildlife species.</p>
<p>However, its distribution is limited and it is not widely cultivated outside its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron neurocarpum was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It thrives in open woodlands and disturbed sites, often colonizing secondary forests. This plant is commonly found in parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. Its introduction has been associated with human activities such as land clearing and agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions.</p>
