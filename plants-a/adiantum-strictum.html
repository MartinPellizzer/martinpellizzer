                <h1>Adiantum strictum</h1>
<p>Adiantum strictum, commonly known as the rigid maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, upright growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori.</p>
<p>Adiantum strictum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum strictum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically light green, with a narrow, lance-shaped form and are arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender, upright, and slightly hairy, with a light green to brownish bark that becomes rough with age. Adiantum strictum produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-yellow in color, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a cluster of sporangia that release spores, which are dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum strictum is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands, stream banks, and rocky areas. This fern thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with humid, forested regions. Its range extends from the eastern United States, particularly in states like Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia, to parts of southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>Adiantum strictum is well adapted to acidic soils and can be found in both forest understories and along the edges of wetlands.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum strictum was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates, particularly in the northeastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. This fern is often found in regions with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its introduction has been documented in several botanical gardens and naturalized populations across the eastern United States.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to colonize disturbed or shaded habitats.</p>
