                    <h1>Altamiranoa calcicola</h1>
<p>Altamiranoa calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant thrives in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>Altamiranoa calcicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying drought-resistant flora.</p>
