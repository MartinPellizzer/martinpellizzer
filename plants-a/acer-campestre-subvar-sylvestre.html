                <h1>Acer campestre subvar. sylvestre</h1>
<p>Acer campestre subvar. sylvestre, commonly known as the European hedge maple, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree or shrub native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 3–8 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are palmately lobed, with five to seven pointed lobes, and are bright green in summer, turning yellow or orange in autumn. It produces small, red-orange flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer campestre subvar. sylvestre has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically 3–8 cm long, with a serrated margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, turning yellow or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a multi-stemmed shrub or small tree. It produces small, yellow-green flowers in panicles during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two wings, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to various soil types and providing stability to the plant.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campestre subvar. sylvestre is a variant of the field maple native to central and eastern Europe, including parts of France, Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Its current distribution has expanded to include areas beyond its native range, such as parts of the United Kingdom and North America, often due to human introduction. It thrives in temperate climates, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils in woodlands, hedgerows, and along stream banks. This species is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,200 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>It is considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, though local populations may be threatened by habitat loss and urban development.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer campestre subvar. sylvestre is a hardy, small deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or layering, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The tree has a slow growth cycle, often reaching maturity within 10 to 20 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization should be minimal, and pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer campestre subvar. sylvestre is a shrub-like tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. Its dense growth acts as a companion plant, offering habitat and protection to other plants in the ecosystem. The roots of this plant help prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the ground in forested and hedgerow areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions within its environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer campestre subvar. sylvestre is a species of maple known for its ornamental value in landscaping and horticulture due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>
<p>While its fruits are not commonly used in culinary applications, the tree's wood has been historically used in small-scale woodworking and crafting. In traditional medicine, parts of the tree have been used to treat ailments such as inflammation and skin conditions.
