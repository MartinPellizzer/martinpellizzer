                    <h1>Acaena leptacantha var. conferta</h1>
<p>Acaena leptacantha var. conferta, commonly known as the densefruit acaena, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its densely hairy stems and leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are covered in hooked bracts, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals. It thrives in coastal and sandy environments, often forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in restoration projects.</p>
