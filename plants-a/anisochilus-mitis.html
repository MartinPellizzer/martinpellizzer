                    <h1>Anisochilus mitis</h1>
<p>Anisochilus mitis, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Anisochilus mitis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
