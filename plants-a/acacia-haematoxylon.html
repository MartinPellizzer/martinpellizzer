<p>Acacia haematoxylon, commonly known as Indian sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to India and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its straight, dark brown to blackish bark, which is often used in traditional medicine and as a dye.

Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in perfumes, incense, and fine furniture.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it an important species in dryland ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia haematoxylon is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Sudan, Eritrea, and Somalia.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of the Middle East, including Yemen and Saudi Arabia. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in savannas and dry woodlands. It is well adapted to hot climates with low rainfall.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into southern Arabia and northern India.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia haematoxylon was mainly introduced to regions for its economic value, particularly for its dark red heartwood used in furniture and dye production.</p>
<p>It has been introduced to parts of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, where it is cultivated for its timber and dye properties. The plant is often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides due to its adaptability to various soil types. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its potential invasiveness in certain environments.</p>
