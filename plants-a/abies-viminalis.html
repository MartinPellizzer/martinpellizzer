<p>Abies viminalis, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its dense, dark green needles that are slightly twisted and have a silvery underside. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, often exfoliating to reveal a lighter inner layer.</p>
<p>Abies viminalis is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude forests, where it plays an important ecological role.</p>
