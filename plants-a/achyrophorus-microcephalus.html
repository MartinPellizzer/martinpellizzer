                    <h1>Achyrophorus microcephalus</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus microcephalus, commonly known as the small-headed achyrophorus, is a rare and elusive plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and possesses small, spoon-shaped leaves that are densely packed. The plant produces delicate, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle beauty to its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Its botanical study is significant for understanding plant adaptations to high-altitude environments.</p>
