                <h1>Acraea mandonii</h1>
<p>Acraea mandonii, commonly known as the Mandon's acraea, is a species of butterfly found in parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Nymphalidae and is characterized by its distinctive wing patterns. The plant it interacts with, such as certain species of milkweed, serves as a host for its larvae. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with specific plants for both feeding and reproduction.</p>
<p>The botanical study of this species contributes to understanding ecological interactions in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acraea mandonii has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth texture and a light greenish-brown color, growing upright and branching sparingly. The flowers are tubular in structure, featuring bright yellow petals and a deep orange throat, blooming during the summer months and primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acraea mandonii is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and South Africa.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in grasslands and shrublands. It is commonly associated with areas that have a dry climate and low rainfall. The distribution of Acraea mandonii is closely linked to the availability of its host plants, which are typically found in these regions.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its adaptation to the ecological conditions of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acraea mandonii was mainly introduced to new habitats in regions with suitable climatic conditions, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates.</p>
<p>It has been observed in parts of Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand and Indonesia, where it thrives in tropical rainforests. The plant's introduction is often associated with human activities such as horticulture and landscape gardening. Its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in invaded ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, careful monitoring is necessary to prevent ecological imbalances.</p>
