<p>Acer oblongum f. microcarpum, commonly known as the dwarf maple, is a compact variant of the common maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smaller, rounded leaves that are typically a vibrant green in summer and turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, red fruits that are less pronounced than those of the typical species. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for smaller gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
