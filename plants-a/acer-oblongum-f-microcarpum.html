                <h1>Acer oblongum f. microcarpum</h1>
<p>Acer oblongum f. microcarpum, commonly known as the dwarf maple, is a variant of the winged maple characterized by its smaller, more compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It features palmate leaves with 5-7 lobes, which are typically dark green and turn vibrant red or orange in autumn. The plant produces small, clustered samaras, which are its winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum f. microcarpum has leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, with a size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, and a dark green color on the upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a bushy growth pattern. The flowers are small, yellow-green catkins that appear in early spring, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, winged samara that disperses by wind, and the seeds are tiny, with the fruit type being a samara.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum f. microcarpum is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China, particularly in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including Europe and North America, where it is grown in botanical gardens and private collections. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically found in temperate forests. It is commonly found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited natural population, Acer oblongum f. microcarpum is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum f. microcarpum is a rare and ornamental maple variety known for its unique foliage and slow growth.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through semi-ripe cuttings taken in late summer or through seeds collected from mature trees, although germination can be slow. This species prefers well-drained, loamy soil and requires consistent moisture, especially during its active growth cycle in spring and summer.</p>
<p>Fertilize it lightly in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in early summer to shape the plant and encourage healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigolds can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum f. microcarpum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. It acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and supporting a diverse range of flora and fauna. The plant also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which helps bind soil and prevent runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to multiple species throughout the year.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum f. microcarpum is a lesser-known variant of the maple tree that has limited direct culinary use but is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in industrial applications, its wood may have niche uses in crafting or as a source of timber in specific regions. Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in local traditions or botanical studies, though its role is not as prominent as other maple species. Its ecological role includes supporting local wildlife and contributing to biodiversity in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Overall, its applications remain largely underexplored compared to more common maple varieties.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum f. microcarpum has a limited number of recognized varieties, but it is widely cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Sutherlandii' and 'Crimson Queen,' known for their vibrant fall colors and compact growth habits. It has been hybridized with other maple species, such as Acer palmatum, to produce unique varieties with enhanced ornamental traits. These hybrids often exhibit improved cold hardiness and more striking foliage colors.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic appeal, Acer oblongum f. microcarpum holds significant horticultural importance in gardens and landscapes.</p>
