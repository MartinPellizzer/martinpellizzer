                <h1>Adhatoda ventricosa</h1>
<p>Adhatoda ventricosa, commonly known as Indian banyan or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in traditional medicine and ecological studies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda ventricosa has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually light green on the upper surface and pale underneath, with a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, woody, and has a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels off in flakes. Its flowers are tubular, with a violet to purple color, and bloom during the rainy season, primarily pollinated by birds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taproot-like, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda ventricosa is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.</p>
<p>It is now widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions around the world, often as an introduced species. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or along riverbanks. It grows at altitudes ranging from lowland to mid-elevation areas, up to approximately 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and overharvesting for traditional medicine.</p>
