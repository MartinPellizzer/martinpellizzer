                    <h1>Aloe glabra</h1>
<p>Aloe glabra, commonly known as the bare-leaf aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically smooth and lack the spines found in many other aloe species. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Aloe glabra is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Its gel is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it is less commonly cultivated than other aloe species.</p>
