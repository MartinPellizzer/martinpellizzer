<p>Angelica cartilaginomarginata var. foliosa, commonly known as the foliate angelica, is a rare and distinctive plant species characterized by its unique leaf morphology.</p>
<p>It features large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense, fuzzy layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its habitat is limited to specific alpine or subalpine regions, where it thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
