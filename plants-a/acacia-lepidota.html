                        <h1>Acacia lepidota</h1>
<p>Acacia lepidota, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, greyish-green stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which bloom in spring and attract a variety of pollinators. Acacia lepidota is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia lepidota is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in savannas and rocky outcrops. This species is well adapted to dry climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Acacia lepidota is also commonly used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and fuelwood.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia lepidota was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, temperate climate, often as an ornamental plant or for its hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with low rainfall and is adapted to thrive in dry conditions. This plant has been introduced to parts of the United States, particularly in the southwestern states. It is also present in some areas of Australia and New Zealand, where it has been cultivated for its aesthetic value.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
