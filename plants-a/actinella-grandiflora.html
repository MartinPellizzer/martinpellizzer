<p>Actinella grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered actinella, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Actinella grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
