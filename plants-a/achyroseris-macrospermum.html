                <h1>Achyroseris macrospermum</h1>
<p>Achyroseris macrospermum, commonly known as the giant desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant has a robust taproot system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments by accessing deep soil moisture. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The showy yellow flowers bloom in late spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyroseris macrospermum has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are usually green and slightly hairy, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and slightly woody, with a grayish-brown bark that is smooth and has a fibrous texture. The flowers are yellow and are arranged in dense, terminal clusters, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyroseris macrospermum is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Utah and Colorado. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open habitats. It is commonly associated with desert scrub and grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyroseris macrospermum was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks. This plant thrives in dry to moist soils and is often seen in open habitats. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various ecological zones, sometimes outcompeting native flora.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common sight in many regions where it has been introduced.</p>
