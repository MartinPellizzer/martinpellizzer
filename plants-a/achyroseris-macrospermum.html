                    <h1>Achyroseris macrospermum</h1>
<p>Achyroseris macrospermum, commonly known as the giant desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant has a robust taproot system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments by accessing deep soil moisture. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The showy yellow flowers bloom in late spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
