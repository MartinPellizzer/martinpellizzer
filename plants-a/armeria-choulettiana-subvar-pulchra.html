                    <h1>Armeria choulettiana subvar. pulchra</h1>
<p>Armeria choulettiana subvar. pulchra, commonly known as the pink sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features dense clusters of pink or purple flowers. The plant produces small, cylindrical seed capsules that release seeds through a unique mechanism involving the drying and splitting of the capsule. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
