<p>Acer cappadocicum var. serrulatum, commonly known as the Cappadocian maple, is a deciduous tree native to Turkey.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with serrated margins, which give it its varietal name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. serrulatum is primarily native to Turkey, particularly the Cappadocia region.</p>
<p>This variety is found in the mountainous areas of central and eastern Turkey. It thrives in rocky and limestone soils at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 meters. The plant is also occasionally reported in parts of northern Syria and northern Iraq.</p>
<p>It is a rare and endemic species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. serrulatum was mainly introduced to specific regions in the United States, particularly in the southeastern states, as a ornamental tree due to its unique foliage and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in areas with mild winters and well-drained soils, making it suitable for USDA hardiness zones 6 through 8. This variety is valued for its ability to thrive in urban environments and its role in supporting local wildlife.
