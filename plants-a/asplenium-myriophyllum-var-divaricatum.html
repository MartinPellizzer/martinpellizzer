                    <h1>Asplenium myriophyllum var. divaricatum</h1>
<p>Asplenium myriophyllum var. divaricatum, commonly known as the spreading spleenwort, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow segments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or on tree trunks, showcasing its epiphytic or lithophytic growth habit. The plant has a compact rosette structure with a central stalk bearing spore-producing structures called sori. Its leaves are usually bright green and may have a slightly waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its preferred habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other members of the Asplenium genus, sharing similar morphological features and ecological preferences.</p>
