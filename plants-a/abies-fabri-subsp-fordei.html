                        <h1>Abies fabri subsp. fordei</h1>
<p>Abies fabri subsp.</p>
<p>fordei, commonly known as the Forde's fir, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the mountainous regions of northern China. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure typical of the fir genus.</p>
<p>The foliage is typically dark green and densely packed, providing a dense canopy. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in high-altitude forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies fabri subsp.</p>
<p>fordei is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province. This subspecies is found in high-altitude areas with cool, moist climates.</p>
<p>It typically grows in coniferous forests and is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils. The plant is often associated with mixed evergreen and deciduous forests in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific elevational ranges, usually between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies fabri subsp.</p>
<p>fordei was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive conical shape and slow growth rate. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic value.</p>
<p>The subspecies is native to China and has been introduced to various regions with suitable climates. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that its introduction may pose a risk to local ecosystems if it escapes cultivation.</p>
