                    <h1>Agropyron × nakashimae</h1>
<p>Agropyron × nakashimae, commonly known as the Japanese wheatgrass, is a hybrid grass species resulting from the cross between Agropyron cristatum and Agropyron elongatum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in dry and disturbed soils. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems, with lemmas that are typically awned. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly Japan, and is adapted to temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop.</p>
