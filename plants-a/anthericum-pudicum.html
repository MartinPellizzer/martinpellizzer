<p>Anthericum pudicum, commonly known as the humble adder's tongue, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, downward-facing flowers that resemble a serpent's tongue, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, preferring rich, loamy soils. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often protected in conservation areas.</p>
