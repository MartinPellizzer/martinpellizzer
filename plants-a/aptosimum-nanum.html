                    <h1>Aptosimum nanum</h1>
<p>Aptosimum nanum, commonly known as the dwarf fescue, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
