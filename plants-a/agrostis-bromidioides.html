<p>Agrostis bromidioides, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has slender,丛生 stems that often form dense tufts, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is usually shorter than the leaves, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Agrostis bromidioides is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
