                    <h1>Agrostis lobata</h1>
<p>Agrostis lobata, commonly known as the mountain bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis lobata typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, rocky habitats such as mountain slopes and meadows.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
