                <h1>Acmena championii</h1>
<p>Acmena championii, commonly known as the African cherry or African sour plum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sterculiaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces small, round fruits that turn from green to yellow or red when ripe, containing several seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmena championii has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as an upright shrub. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's natural habitat in rocky or arid areas.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena championii is primarily native to eastern Australia, specifically the subtropical regions of Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland rainforests, as well as in wetlands and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates with high rainfall and is often associated with moist, fertile soils. It is an important component of the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance, it is also considered a valuable plant for conservation and restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmena championii was mainly introduced to new habitats in regions with warm, humid climates, particularly in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests where it thrives in well-drained, fertile soils. This plant has been introduced for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various environmental conditions. However, its spread has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, careful management is recommended to prevent unintended ecological impacts.</p>
