                    <h1>Atropis biflora</h1>
<p>Atropis biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered atropis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers exhibit a unique bilateral symmetry.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Atropis biflora is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
