<p>Acacia microsperma, commonly known as the small-seeded acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular or cylindrical clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its small, woody pods contain numerous minute, oblong seeds.</p>
<p>Acacia microsperma is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native range.</p>
