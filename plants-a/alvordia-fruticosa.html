<p>Alvordia fruticosa, commonly known as the desert shrub, is a resilient plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, woody stems and dense foliage that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round fruits. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater sources.</p>
<p>Alvordia fruticosa plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
