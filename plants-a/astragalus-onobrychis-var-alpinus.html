                    <h1>Astragalus onobrychis var. alpinus</h1>
<p>Astragalus onobrychis var. alpinus, commonly known as alpine sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and has a deep root system, which helps it thrive in poor, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects.</p>
