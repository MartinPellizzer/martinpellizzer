                <h1>Aechmea urussucensis</h1>
<p>Aechmea urussucensis, commonly known as the Urussucu bromeliad, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored bracts, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Aechmea urussucensis make it a notable subject in both horticulture and ecological studies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea urussucensis has leaves that are sword-shaped, arranged in a rosette, with a waxy, dark green surface and a bluish-white underside.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead having a short, compact growth pattern with a dense, fibrous base. Its inflorescence consists of a terminal spike of small, colorful flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by birds and insects. The fruit is a capsule that produces numerous small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in the soil, supporting the plant's epiphytic or terrestrial growth.</p>
