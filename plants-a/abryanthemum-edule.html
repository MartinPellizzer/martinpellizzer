<p>Abryanthemum edule, commonly known as the edible groundsel, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are succulent and can be consumed raw or cooked, offering a slightly bitter taste.</p>
<p>The plant also produces small yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abryanthemum edule has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, semi-woody, and has a smooth, light green bark that grows upright with some branching.
