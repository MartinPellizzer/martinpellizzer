<p>Andropogon hirtus var. velutinus, commonly known as velvet bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs that give it a velvety texture, especially on the leaves and stems. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is often a deep green, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that appear in late summer.</p>
<p>Velvet bluestem plays an important role in soil stabilization and provides habitat and forage for various wildlife species.</p>
