<p>Adenostyles alpina subsp.</p>
<p>australis, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of southern South America. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense mats or low shrubs.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in mountainous regions.</p>
