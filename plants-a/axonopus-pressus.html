                    <h1>Axonopus pressus</h1>
<p>Axonopus pressus, commonly known as carpetgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growth that often covers the ground, making it a common weed in lawns and agricultural fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers and relies on wind for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, it is both a nuisance and a useful plant in certain ecological contexts.</p>
