<p>Australopyrum retrofractum, commonly known as the southern fractured fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to the temperate regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, frond-like structures that resemble a fractal pattern, giving it its scientific name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, producing spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
