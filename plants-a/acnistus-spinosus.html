                <h1>Acnistus spinosus</h1>
<p>Acnistus spinosus, commonly known as the spiny acnistus, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its propagation.</p>
<p>Acnistus spinosus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus spinosus has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, typically ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length and 1 to 2 cm in width, and are usually a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is grayish-brown in color, and it grows in a prostrate or trailing manner. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in terminal umbels, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus spinosus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats like savannas and rocky outcrops. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed or marginal environments.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into some parts of southern Asia, including India and Sri Lanka.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus spinosus was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has become an invasive species.</p>
<p>It was likely introduced through human activity, such as the accidental transport of seeds on vehicles or in cargo. The plant thrives in disturbed environments, including roadsides and agricultural areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction contribute to its invasive nature.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect native ecosystems.</p>
