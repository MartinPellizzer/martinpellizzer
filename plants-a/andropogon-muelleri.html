                    <h1>Andropogon muelleri</h1>
<p>Andropogon muelleri, commonly known as Mueller's bluestem, is a tall, perennial grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and prairies, where it thrives in moist to wet soils. The plant features narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Mueller's bluestem is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to support local wildlife.</p>
