                <h1>Acrostichum repandum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum repandum, commonly known as the swamp fern, is a perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a member of the fern family and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Acrostichum repandum plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum repandum has leaves that are elongated, lanceolate in shape, and arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, light brown bark, and exhibits a rhizomatous growth pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers with three petals, typically white or pale yellow, blooming in early spring, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dark, round drupe containing a single seed, which is dispersed by wind due to its feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and colonize moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum repandum is primarily native to the tropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas, mangrove swamps, and other wetland habitats. This plant thrives in saline and brackish environments, often growing along the edges of estuaries and tidal flats. Its distribution extends into the Caribbean and along the Atlantic coast of the United States.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to the humid, warm climate and can tolerate periodic flooding.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum repandum was mainly introduced to the coastal areas of the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It is often found in salt marshes and along the edges of tidal flats where it can tolerate brackish water conditions. This plant has also been introduced to parts of the Caribbean and the Atlantic coast of South America. Its introduction has led to its establishment in wetland ecosystems, sometimes competing with native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common sight in coastal regions where it thrives in moist, sandy soils.</p>
