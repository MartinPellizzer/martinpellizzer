                    <h1>Afrolimon namaquanum</h1>
<p>Afrolimon namaquanum, commonly known as the Namibian stone orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the Namib Desert.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and unique, often fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in arid conditions, relying on limited rainfall and well-drained soils for survival. Its botanical features include thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss, and it produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and yellow.</p>
<p>Afrolimon namaquanum is of particular interest to botanists due to its adaptation to extreme desert environments and its limited distribution.</p>
