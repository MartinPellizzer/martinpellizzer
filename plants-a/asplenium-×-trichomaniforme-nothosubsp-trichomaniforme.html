<p>Asplenium × trichomaniforme nothosubsp.</p>
<p>trichomaniforme, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile, clonal hybrid resulting from the cross between *Asplenium trichomanes* and *Asplenium trichomanoides*. It exhibits morphological characteristics intermediate between its parent species, with finely divided, dark green, leathery fronds that resemble those of its ancestors.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a trait shared with other ferns in the Aspleniaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its sterile nature, it does not produce spores and relies on vegetative propagation for survival.</p>
