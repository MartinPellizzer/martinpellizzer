                <h1>Acrocentron boissieri</h1>
<p>Acrocentron boissieri, commonly known as the Boissier's starwort, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered in a distinctive star-like arrangement.</p>
<p>Acrocentron boissieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocentron boissieri has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that exhibits a creeping growth pattern along the ground. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocentron boissieri is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, specifically southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with rocky or limestone soils, such as the Iberian Peninsula, France, and parts of Italy. This plant thrives in arid or semi-arid climates and is often associated with scrublands and open woodlands. It is also present in some regions of the Middle East, including parts of Turkey and Syria.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocentron boissieri was mainly introduced to areas with suitable climate conditions, particularly regions with temperate to subtropical climates.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. The plant has been introduced to several parts of Europe, including France, Italy, and Spain. It is commonly cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
