<p>Acianthera nellyae, commonly known as Nelly's acianthera, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by small bees and moths, and it produces small, round seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
