                <h1>Acianthera nellyae</h1>
<p>Acianthera nellyae, commonly known as Nelly's acianthera, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by small bees and moths, and it produces small, round seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera nellyae has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, featuring white petals with a faint pinkish hue, and they bloom in late spring to early summer, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera nellyae is primarily native to Colombia.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the Andean foothills and humid lowland areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within montane forests. The plant is known for its small, delicate flowers and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Colombia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera nellyae was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Texas, as part of ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>It was initially cultivated for its attractive, fragrant flowers and ease of care. The plant's introduction has led to its establishment in some natural areas, raising concerns about its potential invasive spread. Despite its beauty, it is considered a non-native species that may outcompete native flora in certain environments.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its expansion into sensitive ecosystems.</p>
