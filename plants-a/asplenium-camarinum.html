<p>Asplenium camarinum, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocky surfaces or in crevices, where it forms dense, mat-like colonies. The plant has slender, upright fronds with a lanceolate shape and a dark green, glossy appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium camarinum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky habitats.</p>
