                <h1>Acrodon leptophyllus</h1>
<p>Acrodon leptophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acrodon, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh, arid conditions.</p>
<p>Acrodon leptophyllus is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrodon leptophyllus has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green color and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrodon leptophyllus is primarily native to the southern United States, specifically Texas and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in limestone soils. This plant thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. It is often associated with shrublands and can be found in both coastal and inland areas.</p>
<p>Acrodon leptophyllus is well adapted to the hot, dry climate of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrodon leptophyllus was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. The plant is often associated with disturbed sites and can thrive in both natural and cultivated environments. Its introduction has led to its spread in several states including Washington, Oregon, and California.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common sight in both wild and garden settings.</p>
