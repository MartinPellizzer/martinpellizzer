                    <h1>Anthurium sursumtepalum</h1>
<p>Anthurium sursumtepalum, commonly known as the upward-pointing spathe anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped spathe that typically displays shades of red, orange, or yellow, with a contrasting green spadix in the center. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure consists of a modified leaf (spathe) enclosing the true flowers (spadix), which are small and clustered.</p>
<p>Anthurium sursumtepalum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to add dramatic color to indoor and outdoor gardens.</p>
