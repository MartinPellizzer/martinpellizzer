                    <h1>Agave vivipara var. cabaiensis</h1>
<p>Agave vivipara var. cabaiensis, commonly known as the Mexican filarette, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming structure, with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces offsets, or "pups," at the base, which is a form of vegetative reproduction. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments.</p>
<p>Its striking appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
