<p>Abies tazaotana, commonly known as the Tazaot√°n fir, is a species of fir native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its conical shape and dense foliage, with needle-like leaves that are dark green and slightly twisted. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 2,000 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
