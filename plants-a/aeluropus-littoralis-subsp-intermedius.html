<p>Aeluropus littoralis subsp.</p>
<p>intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate saltbush, is a halophytic grass species adapted to coastal and saline environments. It typically grows in tidal zones and salt marshes, where it tolerates high salinity and periodic flooding.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its root system helps stabilize soils in vulnerable coastal areas.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays an important role in the ecological balance of coastal ecosystems.</p>
