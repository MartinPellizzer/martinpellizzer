                <h1>Adenia senensis</h1>
<p>Adenia senensis, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces yellowish-orange fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a notable species in both horticulture and ecological studies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia senensis has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, with a smooth texture. The stem is woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a climbing growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellow petals and a green calyx, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a fleshy, orange-red berry that disperses its seeds through animal ingestion, with the seeds being small and smooth.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia senensis is primarily native to eastern Australia, specifically Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rainforests and moist woodland areas. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is often seen in the understorey of tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Adenia senensis is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia senensis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soils and is often found near streams or in forest undergrowth. This plant is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections due to its ornamental value. It is also used in traditional medicine in some parts of its native range.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is introduced.</p>
