                <h1>Achyranthes cyclophylla</h1>
<p>Achyranthes cyclophylla, commonly known as the cyclophylla spurge, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which is characterized by its milky sap and often showy floral structures. The plant typically grows to a height of 1â€“2 meters, featuring upright stems and alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes cyclophylla has compound leaves that are pinnate or bipinnate, with lanceolate to ovate leaflets, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically green in color.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that is somewhat woody in mature plants. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in loose panicles, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged samara, dispersing by wind, and the seeds are small and dry.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant to anchor in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes cyclophylla is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in lowland forests and along riverbanks, where it benefits from high humidity and rich soil. It is also known to occur in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes be found in disturbed habitats or as an ornamental plant in gardens.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes cyclophylla was mainly introduced to new habitats due to its adaptability and potential ecological benefits.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and areas with moderate to high rainfall. The plant has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its introduction is often associated with human activities such as agriculture and land development.</p>
<p>However, its impact on local ecosystems remains a subject of ongoing study.</p>
