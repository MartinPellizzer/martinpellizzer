                <h1>Achyranthes cyclophylla</h1>
<p>Achyranthes cyclophylla, commonly known as the creeping knotweed, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its leaves are typically alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes cyclophylla has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 5-10 cm long, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a pale green to brown bark that becomes rough with age. The flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, with greenish-white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from summer to autumn, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes cyclophylla is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent, particularly found in regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Southeast Asia, where it has been introduced and occasionally becomes naturalized. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in moist, shaded areas such as forests and understoreys. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited native range and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of concern, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achyranthes cyclophylla is a hardy, tropical plant known for its rapid growth and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. The plant has a fast growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil with regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain shape and encourage new shoots. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and improve overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
