                <h1>Acnistus parviflorus</h1>
<p>Acnistus parviflorus, commonly known as the smallflower acnistus, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus parviflorus has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy green and typically measure up to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, branching, and covered with a smooth, reddish-brown bark. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, bloom in early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when dried.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a shallow network near the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus parviflorus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in woodland areas, along riverbanks, and in disturbed soils throughout these regions. The plant thrives in humid climates and is often seen in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It is also known to occur in parts of Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often part of the undergrowth in dense forests.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus parviflorus was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, including parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and northern Australia. This plant is often spread through human activities such as landscaping, gardening, and accidental seed dispersal. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its establishment in native ecosystems, sometimes becoming invasive.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation, it is considered a potential weed in many areas where it is non-native.</p>
