<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acnistus parviflorus has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acnistus parviflorus is a flowering plant native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it occurs in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces.</p>
<p>Although it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to specific regions within its native range due to habitat loss and overgrazing. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, typically found in rocky outcrops, grasslands, and along riverbanks. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from human activities, Acnistus parviflorus is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acnistus parviflorus is a low-maintenance shrub known for its vibrant yellow flowers and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the most reliable method for quick growth. The plant has an annual growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and shedding its leaves in the fall.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding overwatering to prevent root rot. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
