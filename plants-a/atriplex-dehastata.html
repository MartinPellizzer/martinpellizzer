                    <h1>Atriplex dehastata</h1>
<p>Atriplex dehastata, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity.</p>
<p>Atriplex dehastata plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
