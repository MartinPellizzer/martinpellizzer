                <h1>Acinodendron hymenantherum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron hymenantherum, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy red flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has a rugged, fissured bark and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. Its leaves are compound, consisting of multiple small leaflets, and it produces woody pods that contain seeds.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this species make it a striking ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron hymenantherum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicle-like inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron hymenantherum is primarily native to the western and central regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, Togo, Benin, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This plant typically grows in tropical rainforests and moist lowland areas. It is commonly associated with secondary vegetation and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron hymenantherum was mainly introduced to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is believed to have been brought there by human activity, possibly through accidental introduction or intentional planting. The plant is now found in various habitats across the island, including dry forests and coastal areas. Due to its adaptability, it has established populations in regions with similar climatic conditions to its native range.</p>
<p>However, its impact on the local ecosystem is still under study.</p>
