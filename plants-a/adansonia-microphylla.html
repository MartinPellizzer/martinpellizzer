                <h1>Adansonia microphylla</h1>
<p>Adansonia microphylla, commonly known as the baobab tree, is a deciduous tree native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, bottle-shaped trunk that stores large amounts of water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The tree has small, leathery leaves and produces yellow, clustered flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit, known as a "monkey bread," is edible and contains a pulp rich in nutrients.</p>
<p>The plant plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adansonia microphylla has small, narrow, and leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, typically measuring up to 5 cm in length and varying in color from dark green to greyish-green.</p>
<p>Its stem is thick and woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grey or brown in color, and it grows as a solitary trunk with a short, knotted base. The flowers are large, with a white or pale yellow color, and consist of a central spadix surrounded by a crown of bracts; they bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by bats and insects. The fruit is a round, fibrous pod that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the plant to survive in arid conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adansonia microphylla is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the dry, arid regions of the island, particularly in the south and west. This species thrives in rocky soils and is commonly found in dry forests and spiny thickets. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>The tree is known for its unique appearance and plays an important role in the local ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adansonia microphylla was mainly introduced to areas with low rainfall and well-drained soils, typically in regions with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is often found in coastal areas with mild winters. This plant is well adapted to withstand periods of drought and high temperatures. It has small, thick leaves that reduce water loss and a deep root system that helps it access groundwater.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it has been introduced to several regions outside its native range for ornamental and ecological purposes.</p>
