                    <h1>Anacamptis palustris</h1>
<p>Anacamptis palustris, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats across Europe.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, unbranched flowering stems topped with a dense spike of violet-blue to purple flowers. The orchid has a specialized root system that allows it to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. It is pollinated primarily by bees and other insects attracted to its fragrant blooms.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and stabilizing soil.</p>
