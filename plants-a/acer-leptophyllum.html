<p>Acer leptophyllum, commonly known as the mountain maple, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It typically grows in mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and cooler climates. The plant has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in early spring before the leaves fully emerge.</p>
<p>The tree produces samaras, or winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation.</p>
