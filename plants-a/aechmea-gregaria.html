                <h1>Aechmea gregaria</h1>
<p>Aechmea gregaria, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Aechmea gregaria is often used as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea gregaria has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, waxy, and sword-like, arranged in a tight spiral around the central rosette, with a dark green color and a slight blue tint.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a typical stem, instead forming a compact, low-growing rosette with a dense, fibrous covering that resembles bark. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, typically in shades of pink or red, and bloom during the dry season, pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry that contains small, black seeds, dispersed by animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb water efficiently, allowing the plant to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
