<p>Aridaria rabiei, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and succulent leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in xeriscaping and desert gardens.</p>
