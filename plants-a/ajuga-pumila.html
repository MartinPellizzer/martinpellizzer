<p>Ajuga pumila, commonly known as carpet bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, dark green leaves that are slightly heart-shaped. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Ajuga pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to suppress weed growth in garden settings.</p>
