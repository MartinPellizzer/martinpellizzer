<p>Astragalus rupicola, commonly known as the rock milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>

The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>Astragalus rupicola is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, with deep roots that help it access water and nutrients in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
