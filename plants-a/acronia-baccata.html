                <h1>Acronia baccata</h1>
<p>Acronia baccata, commonly known as the red-fruited acronia, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. These fruits are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>Acronia baccata is often found in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia baccata has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 3 to 8 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animal consumption and droppings.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia baccata is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas and is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils. This plant is often associated with chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. It is well adapted to the mild, wet winters and dry summers of these regions.</p>
<p>Acronia baccata is also occasionally found in parts of northern Baja California, Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia baccata was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and ornamental plant trade.</p>
<p>It has established populations in regions with similar climatic conditions to its native range. The plant's introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems. It is often found in disturbed areas, contributing to the spread of invasive species.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to prevent its further spread and mitigate ecological risks.</p>
