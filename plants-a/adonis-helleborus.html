                <h1>Adonis helleborus</h1>
<p>Adonis helleborus, commonly known as the white hellebore, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a poisonous sap that contains cardiac glycosides, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis helleborus has basal, palmately lobed leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a waxy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, smooth, and green, growing from the base to form a compact shrub. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, with a cup-like structure and prominent yellow anthers, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when dry.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis helleborus is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky soils and open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. This plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Its native range extends across countries like Spain, Italy, Greece, and Turkey.</p>
<p>It is often associated with mountainous areas and is a characteristic species of the Mediterranean flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis helleborus was mainly introduced to Europe and parts of North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, showy flowers.</p>
<p>It has since spread beyond cultivated gardens, becoming a weed in some areas, particularly in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant thrives in temperate climates and can tolerate a range of soil conditions, which contributes to its invasive potential. Its rapid growth and ability to self-seed make it challenging to control in natural ecosystems.</p>
<p>As a result, it is now considered a problematic species in several regions where it has established itself outside of its original cultivation.</p>
