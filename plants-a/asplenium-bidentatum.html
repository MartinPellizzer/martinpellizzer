<p>Asplenium bidentatum, commonly known as the two-tooth fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with erect, lance-shaped fronds that are divided into pairs of serrated pinnae. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid conditions.</p>
