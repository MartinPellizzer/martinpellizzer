                <h1>Acosta paniculata</h1>
<p>Acosta paniculata, commonly known as the yellow panicled orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in paniculate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, hairy texture.</p>
<p>Acosta paniculata is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta paniculata has simple, alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually green on top and slightly lighter underneath, with a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and often branched, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, arranged in paniculate inflorescences, and bloom during the dry season; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's growth in disturbed or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta paniculata is primarily native to South America, particularly in the countries of Brazil, Peru, and Colombia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Amazon rainforest and adjacent regions, thriving in humid, tropical environments. This plant typically grows in lowland areas with rich, well-drained soil. It is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Acosta paniculata plays an important ecological role in these ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta paniculata was mainly introduced to the tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil, Peru, and Colombia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and abandoned fields. This plant has also been introduced to some parts of Central America and the Caribbean. Its introduction is often associated with human activities, including agriculture and land clearing.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can thrive in a variety of soil types and environmental conditions.</p>
