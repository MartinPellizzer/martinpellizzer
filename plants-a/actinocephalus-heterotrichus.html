                <h1>Actinocephalus heterotrichus</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus heterotrichus, commonly known as the star-shaped liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, star-like thallus structure composed of overlapping, leaf-like lobes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its thallus for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The species is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and microhabitat creation.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus heterotrichus has leaves that are simple, ovate in shape, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and have a white to pale yellow color, blooming during the spring season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant in the soil and absorbing nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus heterotrichus is primarily native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, including the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast or in mountainous areas. It is commonly associated with fynbos vegetation, which is characteristic of the region.</p>
<p>The species is well adapted to the dry, sunny conditions typical of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus heterotrichus was mainly introduced to areas with suitable moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, waste areas, and along riverbanks. This plant has been reported in several regions of the southeastern United States, including Florida and Georgia. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it a potential invasive species in certain environments.</p>
<p>However, it is not currently classified as a noxious weed in most states.</p>
