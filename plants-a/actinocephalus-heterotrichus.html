                    <h1>Actinocephalus heterotrichus</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus heterotrichus, commonly known as the star-shaped liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, star-like thallus structure composed of overlapping, leaf-like lobes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its thallus for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The species is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and microhabitat creation.</p>
