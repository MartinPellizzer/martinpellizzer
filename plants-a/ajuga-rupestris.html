                    <h1>Ajuga rupestris</h1>
<p>Ajuga rupestris, commonly known as rock ajuga, is a low-growing perennial herb native to rocky and gravelly habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and colonize rocky slopes effectively.</p>
<p>Ajuga rupestris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments.</p>
