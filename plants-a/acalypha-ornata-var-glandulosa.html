                <h1>Acalypha ornata var. glandulosa</h1>
<p>Acalypha ornata var. glandulosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or glandular acalypha, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, soft foliage that gives it a velvety texture. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are often covered with fine, glandular hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha ornata var. glandulosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and reddish-brown in color, growing in a bushy pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha ornata var. glandulosa is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other tropical and subtropical regions around the world. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It typically grows at altitudes between 300 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, it is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, although its distribution is still limited and it faces threats from habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acalypha ornata var. glandulosa is a striking ornamental plant known for its vibrant foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant thrives in a warm, humid climate with a growth cycle that includes a dormant period during winter, making it ideal for indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilization during the growing season with a balanced liquid fertilizer and occasional pruning to maintain shape are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants like hibiscus or monstera can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a shaded garden setting.</p>
