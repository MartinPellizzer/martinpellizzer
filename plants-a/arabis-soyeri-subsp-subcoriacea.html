<p>Arabis soyeri subsp.</p>
<p>subcoriacea, commonly known as the rough rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of oblanceolate, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of flowering stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological niche, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections.</p>
