<p>Amphiphyllum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid thornplant, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, spiny foliage that provides protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Amphiphyllum rigidum is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
