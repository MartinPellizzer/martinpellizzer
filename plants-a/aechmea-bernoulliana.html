                <h1>Aechmea bernoulliana</h1>
<p>Aechmea bernoulliana, commonly known as the Bernoulli's bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red and orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Aechmea bernoulliana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and unique foliage structure.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea bernoulliana has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, sword-like, and arranged in a tight spiral, with a waxy, bluish-green color and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a true stem, instead having a short, thick base covered in a dense layer of leaf sheaths that resemble bark. Its inflorescence is a spadix surrounded by colorful bracts, with small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a berry that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in its rocky or epiphytic habitat.</p>
