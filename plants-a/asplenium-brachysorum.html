<p>Asplenium brachysorum, commonly known as the broad-leaved spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Asplenium brachysorum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, semi-shaded conditions.</p>
