                    <h1>Alsine clementei</h1>
<p>Alsine clementei, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to quickly absorb moisture after rare rainfall.</p>
<p>Alsine clementei plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
