                    <h1>Alafia perrieri var. parvifolia</h1>
<p>Alafia perrieri var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved alafia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of its close relatives. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are often clustered around the spadix.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native environment.</p>
