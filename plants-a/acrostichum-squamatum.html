                <h1>Acrostichum squamatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum squamatum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique fern species native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that are covered in fine, scale-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are typically located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is not commonly cultivated due to its specific habitat requirements.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum squamatum has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are elongated, narrow, and often serrated, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, pale green bark that remains relatively unchanging throughout the plant's life. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spadices, typically appearing in late spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping it spread vegetatively and anchor itself in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum squamatum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, warm climates and is commonly found in lowland rainforests and swampy areas. This fern is often associated with wetland ecosystems and can be found along riverbanks and in shaded, moist habitats. It is well adapted to the high rainfall and humidity typical of these regions.</p>
<p>The plant's distribution is largely restricted to the Indo-Malayan region, where it plays a role in maintaining ecological balance in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum squamatum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and use in landscaping.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil, making it suitable for coastal areas and wetlands. This plant is often found in disturbed habitats, such as roadsides and abandoned fields, where it can establish quickly. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes contribute to its invasive potential in some regions.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
