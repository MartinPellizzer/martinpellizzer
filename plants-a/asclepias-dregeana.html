<p>Asclepias dregeana, commonly known as the Desert Milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release seeds with silky filaments, aiding in wind dispersal. Asclepias dregeana is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
<p>It plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including certain species of butterflies.</p>
