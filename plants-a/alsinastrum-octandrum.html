<p>Alsinastrum octandrum, commonly known as goatweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, tubular flowers that are typically pink to red in color, which bloom in summer. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to harsh environments.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in some areas, it can outcompete native vegetation and is often considered a weed.</p>
