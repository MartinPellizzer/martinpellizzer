                    <h1>Acacia spinescens</h1>
<p>Acacia spinescens, commonly known as the prickly acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that bloom during the rainy season, attracting various pollinators. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Acacia spinescens plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing shelter for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
