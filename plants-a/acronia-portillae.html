                <h1>Acronia portillae</h1>
<p>Acronia portillae, commonly known as the Portilla's acronia, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring broad, lance-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. Acronia portillae produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season, adapting to its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia portillae has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia portillae is primarily native to the western coast of Mexico, specifically in the states of Sinaloa and Nayarit.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in coastal areas with sandy soils and is commonly found in dune ecosystems. It is adapted to withstand saline conditions and frequent coastal winds. Acronia portillae is an endemic species, meaning it is found nowhere else in the world.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the unique environmental conditions of these coastal regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia portillae was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often found in coastal regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate sunlight and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses. This plant is particularly adapted to tropical and subtropical zones, making it a popular choice for ornamental purposes. Its introduction has been noted in several regions where it has established itself as an invasive species.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains limited to specific ecological niches that support its growth.</p>
