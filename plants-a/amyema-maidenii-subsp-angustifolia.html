<p>Amyema maidenii subsp.</p>
<p>angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems.</p>
<p>The plant relies on host trees, such as eucalypts, for water and nutrients, while photosynthesizing independently. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically visited by insects for pollination.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaf shape compared to other varieties within the Amyema genus.</p>
