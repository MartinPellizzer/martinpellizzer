<p>Agropyron × androssovii, commonly known as the Androsowian wheatgrass, is a hybrid grass species that results from the cross between Agropyron cristatum and Agropyron elongatum.</p>
<p>It is native to the steppes of Central Asia and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system. The plant typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm and produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stems. It is adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable forage grass in arid regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a hardy nature that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
