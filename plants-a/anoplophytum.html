<p>Anoplophytum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. They are characterized by their succulent, fleshy leaves and small, clustered flowers that often appear in shades of yellow or red. The genus includes several species, such as *Anoplophytum arenicola*, which is well adapted to sandy soils and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Anoplophytum plants are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and ability to thrive in harsh environments.</p>
