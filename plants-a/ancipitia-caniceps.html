<p>Ancipitia caniceps, commonly known as the crown-of-thorns, is a unique succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of spiny, fleshy stems that form a shrub-like structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Ancipitia caniceps is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive dry conditions.</p>
