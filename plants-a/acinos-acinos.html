                <h1>Acinos acinos</h1>
<p>Acinos acinos, commonly known as alpine everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, commonly known as the sunflower or daisy family. This perennial herb is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers and silver-gray foliage. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky soils at high elevations.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its resilience to harsh climatic conditions and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos acinos has small, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, typically measuring around 1-2 cm in length, with a grayish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is low-growing, with a reddish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly woody, and it spreads horizontally along the ground. The flowers are small, yellowish-green structures arranged in clusters, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the rocky and arid environments where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos acinos is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>Its current distribution extends to parts of northern Africa and southwestern Asia, including regions such as Morocco and Turkey. It thrives in rocky, open habitats such as cliffs, screes, and limestone slopes, often in sunny and well-drained areas. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Acinos acinos is considered to be of conservation concern, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acinos acinos is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe, known for its delicate white flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the existing clumps, with seeds requiring cold stratification for optimal germination. The plant has a perennial growth cycle, thriving in early spring and blooming in late summer, then going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soil and requires consistent moisture without waterlogging. Fertilization should be minimal, with light feeding in early spring, and regular pruning to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs in damp conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with thyme or lavender can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acinos acinos is a low-growing flowering plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in alpine and rocky habitats, supporting biodiversity in harsh environments. It also helps in erosion control due to its dense root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to soil stabilization and can improve soil quality in nutrient-poor areas.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acinos acinos is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It has limited culinary use, primarily as a seasoning in some traditional dishes due to its mild aromatic properties. Historically, it has been used in herbal medicine for its potential calming and digestive benefits. While not widely used in industry, it contributes to biodiversity and supports pollinators in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is sometimes associated with resilience and alpine landscapes, symbolizing the beauty of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acinos acinos has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are appreciated for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Albus' and 'Caucasicus', which are known for their striking white and yellow flowers, respectively. While natural hybrids are rare, gardeners often create crosses to enhance flower color and hardiness. These plants hold horticultural importance due to their ability to thrive in rocky or dry soils, making them suitable for alpine gardens and rockeries.</p>
<p>Their compact growth and long blooming period add visual interest to diverse garden settings.</p>
