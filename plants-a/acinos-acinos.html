                    <h1>Acinos acinos</h1>
<p>Acinos acinos, commonly known as the alpine everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its compact, cushion-like form and dense foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid, high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Acinos acinos is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
