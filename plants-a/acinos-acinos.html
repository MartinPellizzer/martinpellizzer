                <h1>Acinos acinos</h1>
<p>Acinos acinos, commonly known as the alpine everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its compact, cushion-like form and dense foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid, high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>Acinos acinos is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinos acinos has leaves that are narrow, linear, and grass-like, arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-gray color due to dense pubescence.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense heads, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos acinos is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky, dry, and sunny habitats such as slopes, cliffs, and gravelly soils. This species thrives in temperate climates with mild winters and hot, dry summers. It is often associated with open woodlands and grasslands.</p>
<p>Its native range extends across countries like Spain, France, Italy, and Turkey.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinos acinos was mainly introduced to specific regions in the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is often found in open, sunny areas such as grasslands and disturbed soils. This plant is known for its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the spring. It has been documented in both natural and cultivated settings, often as an ornamental species.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
