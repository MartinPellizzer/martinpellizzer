                <h1>Acer saccharum subsp. ozarkense</h1>
<p>Acer saccharum subsp.</p>
<p>ozarkense, commonly known as the Ozark sugar maple, is a subspecies of the sugar maple native to the Ozark Plateau in the United States. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its palmate leaves with three to five lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and gold in the fall.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 20â€“30 meters and has a broad, rounded crown.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to the specific soil and climate conditions of its native region, making it an important part of the local flora.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer saccharum subsp.</p>
<p>ozarkense has palmately compound leaves that are typically 5-9 lobes, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter green or slightly hairy underside, arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a deciduous tree with a rounded crown.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, yellow-green catkins that appear in early spring, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer saccharum subsp.</p>
<p>ozarkense is a subspecies of sugar maple native to the central United States, primarily found in the Ozark Highlands. Its current distribution includes parts of Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Kansas, though its range has been significantly reduced.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in mixed hardwood forests and along stream valleys. This subspecies typically grows at elevations between 300 and 900 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a species of conservation concern, with limited populations and restricted distribution.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer saccharum subsp.</p>
<p>ozarkense is a variant of the sugar maple known for its adaptability and ornamental value. It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination.</p>
<p>The growth cycle involves slow establishment in the first few years, followed by steady growth and flowering in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to shape the tree and remove dead branches.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be susceptible to aphids and verticillium wilt, and it pairs well with flowering shrubs and grasses in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer saccharum subsp.</p>
<p>ozarkense is a vital component of forest ecosystems, providing food and shelter for a variety of wildlife. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, while its seeds are a food source for birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved soil conditions. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity and ecological balance of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer saccharum subsp.</p>
<p>ozarkense is a lesser-known subspecies of sugar maple, primarily valued for its ecological role in forest ecosystems. While it is not commonly used in culinary applications like its more famous relative, it contributes to local biodiversity and supports wildlife.</p>
<p>In medicinal contexts, it has been studied for its potential anti-inflammatory properties, though research remains limited. Industrially, it plays a role in timber production, providing wood for furniture and construction in certain regions.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes the natural heritage of the Ozark region, inspiring conservation efforts and local identity.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer saccharum subsp.</p>
<p>ozarkense has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Crimson King' and 'Autumn Flame,' which display vibrant fall colors. Hybrid varieties, such as those resulting from crosses with other maple species, often exhibit enhanced growth habits and coloration.</p>
<p>These cultivars and hybrids are significant in horticulture due to their adaptability to different climates and their ability to provide seasonal interest in landscapes. They are commonly used in gardens, parks, and urban settings for their aesthetic appeal. The horticultural importance of Acer saccharum subsp.</p>
<p>ozarkense lies in its contribution to the diversity of maple trees available for landscaping and ornamental purposes.</p>
