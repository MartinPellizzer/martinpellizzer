                <h1>Adenocalymma portoricense</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma portoricense, commonly known as the Brazilian flame tree, is a striking tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers during the dry season, which are clustered in panicles and attract various pollinators. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma portoricense is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma portoricense has leaves that are simple, alternate, elliptical in shape, and typically measure between 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and covered with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma portoricense is primarily native to the Brazilian states of Pará, Maranhão, and Piauí, as well as parts of northern Venezuela and Guyana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland tropical rainforests and humid savannas. The plant thrives in areas with high rainfall and well-drained soils. It is often associated with riverine and coastal vegetation.</p>
<p>Its natural range is limited to specific regions within the Neotropical region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma portoricense was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Texas and California, as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has shown invasive tendencies in some regions, outcompeting native flora. The plant's introduction has raised concerns among ecologists about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread in non-native habitats.</p>
