<p>Aspidium stenopteron, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically borne on long, creeping rhizomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in small, clusters on the undersides of the fronds, which are released during the wet season.</p>
<p>Aspidium stenopteron plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
