                    <h1>Androsace lanuginosa var. typica</h1>
<p>Androsace lanuginosa var. typica, commonly known as the downy androsace, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, downy appearance.</p>
<p>This species is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates.</p>
