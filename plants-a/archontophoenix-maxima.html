<p>Archontophoenix maxima, commonly known as the Queen sago, is a cycad native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a thick, unbranched trunk that is often covered in a fibrous, spongy material. Its reproductive structures include male and female cones, which are typical of cycads.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
