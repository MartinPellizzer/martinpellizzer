<p>Acetosa cordata has heart-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a waxy surface and a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that disperses its seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acetosa cordata is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Alps and the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>Its current distribution extends to parts of northern Africa and southwestern Asia, though it remains most commonly found in its native range. It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically growing in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Acetosa cordata is usually found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is classified as a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acetosa cordata is a hardy, flowering plant known for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or division, with seeds sown in early spring and division performed in early spring or fall. The growth cycle of Acetosa cordata includes a period of active growth in spring, flowering in summer, and dormancy in winter, depending on the climate.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth.
