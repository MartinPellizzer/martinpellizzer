                <h1>Achyrocline mollis</h1>
<p>Achyrocline mollis, commonly known as the white-flowered cypress, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>Achyrocline mollis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline mollis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dull green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown color, with a somewhat ridged texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale blue petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are tiny, wind-dispersed.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry conditions of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline mollis is primarily native to Colombia and Ecuador.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the Andean regions of these countries. It thrives in high-altitude grasslands and open areas with well-drained soils. Achyrocline mollis is often associated with dry and temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within these South American nations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline mollis was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern Brazil, particularly in the states of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its fragrant flowers and compact growth habit. The plant has since become naturalized in these areas, often found growing in sandy soils along the shoreline. It is considered an invasive species in some parts of its introduced range, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its spread is facilitated by wind dispersal of its seeds and its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats.</p>
