                <h1>Abutilon bastardioides</h1>
<p>Abutilon bastardioides, commonly known as the woolly abutilon, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy yellow flowers. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine, white hairs, which give the plant its distinctive appearance. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, black seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and long blooming period.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon bastardioides has ovate to lanceolate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a smooth texture and a dark green upper surface contrasting with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, bark-like texture that is typically brownish-gray in color, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are pendulous, with a distinctive structure consisting of five narrow sepals that resemble petals, and they bloom in late spring to early summer, displaying a pale yellow to orange color.</p>
<p>They are primarily pollinated by insects, particularly bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon bastardioides is a shrub native to the western United States, specifically found in California and Nevada.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it has been introduced to other regions, including parts of western Europe and Australia. This plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats such as cliffs and slopes, often in areas with full sun exposure. It typically grows at altitudes between 600 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its limited natural range and habitat specificity make it a species of concern for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon bastardioides is a fast-growing, deciduous shrub known for its vibrant orange flowers and velvety leaves.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or division, with stem cuttings being the most reliable method for quick results. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil, with regular watering during the growing season to maintain moist but not waterlogged conditions.</p>
<p>Fertilize it with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and prune after flowering to encourage bushier growth and maintain shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be controlled with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
