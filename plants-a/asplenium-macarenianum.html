                    <h1>Asplenium macarenianum</h1>
<p>Asplenium macarenianum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocks or in rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate, while its spores are produced in sori located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium macarenianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
