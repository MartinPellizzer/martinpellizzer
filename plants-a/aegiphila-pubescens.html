                <h1>Aegiphila pubescens</h1>
<p>Aegiphila pubescens, commonly known as the hairy leaf shrub, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila pubescens has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a silvery-gray underside due to dense pubescence.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in spring with a pale pink to white color, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses seeds by wind after maturation.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
