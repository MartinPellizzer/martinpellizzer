                        <h1>Acantholimon gilliatii</h1>
<p>Acantholimon gilliatii, commonly known as Gilliat's sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Gilliat's sandthrift is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in coastal and inland desert regions.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acantholimon gilliatii belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and some green algae, characterized by their ability to perform photosynthesis and their complex cellular structures. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species, such as roses and magnolias, and is distinguished by their floral structures.</p>
<p>Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes succulents and plants with distinctive floral morphology, often adapted to arid environments. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, a family of flowering plants commonly found in arid and coastal regions, known for their medicinal properties and distinctive blue or purple flowers. Its genus is Acantholimon, a group of flowering plants typically found in dry and rocky habitats, characterized by their small, often blue or purple flowers and succulent leaves.</p>
<p>Its species is Acantholimon gilliatii, a specific plant within the genus Acantholimon, native to certain regions of the Mediterranean and characterized by its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon gilliatii is primarily native to Iran.</p>
<p>It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country, particularly in the central and eastern parts. This plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often in mountainous and coastal areas. It is adapted to the harsh climate conditions of Iran, including high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Iran's diverse landscapes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acantholimon gilliatii was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in coastal or inland regions with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks. This plant has been reported in several states across the western United States, including California, Oregon, and Nevada. Its introduction is often associated with human activities, such as landscaping and land development.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a persistent weed in certain ecosystems.</p>
