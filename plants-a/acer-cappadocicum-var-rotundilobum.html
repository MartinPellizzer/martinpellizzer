                <h1>Acer cappadocicum var. rotundilobum</h1>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. rotundilobum, commonly known as the Turkish maple, is a deciduous tree native to Turkey and parts of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive crown with elongated, serrated leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and grey, becoming fissured with age, and it prefers well-drained soils in full sun.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color and unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. rotundilobum has palmately compound leaves that are broadly ovate to rounded, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement, typically measuring 5â€“10 cm in length, and turn vibrant red or orange in autumn. The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and the plant grows as a shrub or small tree with a spreading habit. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the roots are fibrous, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. rotundilobum is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of central Anatolia, primarily in Turkey.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Cappadocia region, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. This variant prefers sunny to partially shaded environments and is typically found at elevations between 1,200 and 2,000 meters. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from land use changes, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve this unique plant species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. rotundilobum is a unique maple variety known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or hardwood cuttings, with seedlings requiring careful attention to germination conditions. This species exhibits a slow to moderate growth cycle, often reaching maturity over several decades.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires consistent watering during dry periods without becoming waterlogged. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. rotundilobum is a unique maple species that provides food and shelter for various wildlife, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in mixed woodlands, enhancing soil health and promoting the growth of neighboring species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil and prevents runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, its presence supports a diverse ecosystem by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum var. rotundilobum is a lesser-known plant with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in local traditional dishes in certain regions.</p>
<p>It has been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, though more research is needed.
