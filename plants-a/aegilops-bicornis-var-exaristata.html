                    <h1>Aegilops bicornis var. exaristata</h1>
<p>Aegilops bicornis var. exaristata, commonly known as the two-awned goatgrass, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive two awns on each lemma, which are slender, bristle-like structures. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as fields and rocky areas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic relationship to wheat and its potential for agricultural use.</p>
