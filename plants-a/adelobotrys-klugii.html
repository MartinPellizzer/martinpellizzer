                <h1>Adelobotrys klugii</h1>
<p>Adelobotrys klugii, commonly known as the Klug's rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with distinctive four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its small, bright yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Adelobotrys klugii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys klugii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and covered with a rough, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys klugii is primarily native to Brazil North, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It typically grows in humid, lowland areas with rich soil. Adelobotrys klugii is commonly found in forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the ecological conditions of the Amazon and Andean regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelobotrys klugii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest environments. This plant is often associated with areas where its native range overlaps with introduced species. It has been reported in several states including Oregon and Washington.</p>
<p>Its distribution is primarily limited to areas with suitable moisture and soil conditions.</p>
