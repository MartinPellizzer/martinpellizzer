                <h1>Acmella kalelii</h1>
<p>Acmella kalelii, commonly known as the flame flower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, brightly colored flowers. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. Its flowers are typically bright red or orange, with a distinctive central disc surrounded by ray florets.</p>
<p>Acmella kalelii is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmella kalelii has leaves that are orbicular in shape, with a waxy surface and a deep green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age. Its flowers are small, yellow with a red center, and are arranged in clusters, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when mature.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to poor soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmella kalelii is primarily native to Brazil North.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the northern regions of Brazil, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats within this region. The species is adapted to the humid and warm conditions typical of the area.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Brazil's northern states.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
