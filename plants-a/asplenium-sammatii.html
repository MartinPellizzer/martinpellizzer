<p>Asplenium sammatii, commonly known as the Sammat's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or shaded areas, often on limestone or other calcareous substrates. The plant has a compact rosette of dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into narrow, serrated segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium sammatii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
