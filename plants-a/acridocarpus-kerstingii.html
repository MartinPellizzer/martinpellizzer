                <h1>Acridocarpus kerstingii</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus kerstingii, commonly known as the kersting's fan palm, is a tropical plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus kerstingii has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus kerstingii is primarily native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is found in the dry and humid regions of the island, particularly in the southern and eastern parts. This plant thrives in tropical climates and is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests. It is well adapted to the diverse ecological conditions of Madagascar.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely restricted to this region, making it a unique component of the island's flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus kerstingii was mainly introduced to coastal and lowland areas in tropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is commonly associated with maritime climates. Due to its hardy nature, it has become naturalized in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to its classification as an invasive species in some areas, where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
