                <h1>Adenosma inopinata</h1>
<p>Adenosma inopinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved adenosma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with five petals and a prominent tube, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Adenosma inopinata is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky crevices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma inopinata has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly woody with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma inopinata is primarily native to Malaya.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant species that thrives in the tropical regions of this area. The plant is commonly found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed sites. It plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific regions within Malaya due to its ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma inopinata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and disturbed forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant spreads primarily through seed dispersal by wind, water, and animal activity. It is often found in regions with a warm to temperate climate.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common invasive species in several parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
