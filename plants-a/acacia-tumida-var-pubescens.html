                        <h1>Acacia tumida var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Acacia tumida var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which are typically followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a capacity to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia.</p>
<p>This species is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
