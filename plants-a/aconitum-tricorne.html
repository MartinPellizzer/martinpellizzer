                <h1>Aconitum tricorne</h1>
<p>Aconitum tricorne, commonly known as the three-cornered monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, helmet-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant features compound leaves with three distinct lobes, giving it its common name. Aconitum tricorne thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>It contains potent alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum tricorne has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are large, typically measuring up to 30 cm in diameter, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and somewhat hollow, with a grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, arranged in racemes, and have a unique three-lobed petal structure; they bloom in late summer and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that releases winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, tuberous, and fibrous, often used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum tricorne is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in countries such as Austria, France, Germany, and Switzerland.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in moist, shaded areas along stream banks and forest edges. This plant is commonly found in the Alps and the Carpathian Mountains, where it adapts to cool, temperate climates. It prefers well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or gravelly substrates.</p>
<p>Aconitum tricorne is a striking plant known for its blue or purple flowers, which bloom in late summer.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum tricorne was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its striking purple flowers and hardy nature.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the country in the 19th century by European settlers who admired its aesthetic value. Despite its beauty, the plant has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native flora in forested areas. Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts are now underway to control its population and prevent further spread.</p>
