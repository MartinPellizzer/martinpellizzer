                    <h1>Arthraxon schimperi</h1>
<p>Arthraxon schimperi, commonly known as the African grass or Schimper's grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, forming dense mats that can dominate disturbed or degraded soils.</p>
<p>Arthraxon schimperi is often found in open habitats such as savannas, grasslands, and along riverbanks.</p>
