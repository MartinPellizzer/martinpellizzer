                <h1>Acomastylis depressa</h1>
<p>Acomastylis depressa, commonly known as the flat-stemmed daisy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers with white centers, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Acomastylis depressa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its compact form and delicate floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acomastylis depressa has small, succulent leaves that are fleshy, oval-shaped, and arranged in a rosette pattern, typically ranging from 1 to 3 centimeters in length and varying in color from green to bluish-green.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, grayish-green bark that grows close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, blooming in early spring, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomastylis depressa is primarily native to South America, specifically Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Andean regions, particularly in the high-altitude grasslands known as the Puna. This plant thrives in dry, temperate climates and is often associated with rocky or sandy soils. It is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of the Andes, including strong winds and intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and localized within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acomastylis depressa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is believed to have been brought there through human activity, likely as a contaminant in agricultural or horticultural products. This plant is now considered a weed in certain regions of New Zealand. It has adapted well to the local environment and has spread across various habitats.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential impact on native flora and ecosystems.</p>
