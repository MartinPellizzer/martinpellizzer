                <h1>Acinodendron reclinatum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron reclinatum, commonly known as the hanging acacia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron reclinatum has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron reclinatum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, lowland forests and is commonly found in areas with high humidity and warm climates. This plant is often associated with secondary growth forests and can be seen growing along stream banks and in shaded undergrowth. Its distribution is also reported in parts of India and the Andaman Islands.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron reclinatum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several countries across Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Africa. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and coastal areas. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions have contributed to its spread in these regions.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas where it may outcompete native vegetation.</p>
