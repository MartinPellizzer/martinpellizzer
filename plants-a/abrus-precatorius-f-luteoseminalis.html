<p>Abrus precatorius f. luteoseminalis, commonly known as the golden seed maple or yellow-seeded Abrus, is a variant of the common monkey bean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellow seeds, which contrast with the typical red or black seeds of the species. The plant is a climbing vine with compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is largely due to its striking seed color, making it a popular choice for botanical gardens and collections.</p>
