                <h1>Acer monspessulanum var. athoum</h1>
<p>Acer monspessulanum var. athoum, commonly known as the Spanish maple, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn bright yellow in autumn, providing striking visual appeal. The tree typically grows to a height of 10â€“20 meters, with a rounded crown and smooth, grey bark. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum var. athoum has alternate, palmately compound leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring up to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is shallow and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum var. athoum is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the western Mediterranean region, specifically found in parts of southern France, Spain, and northern Africa.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more extensive, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Pyrenees and southern France. It thrives in humid, temperate climates, often growing in moist woodlands and along stream banks. This species is typically found at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum var. athoum is a rare and ornamental maple species known for its striking foliage and unique growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a slow development phase, with the tree reaching maturity over several decades.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires consistent watering during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other shade-loving plants can enhance its aesthetic value in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer monspessulanum var. athoum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and birds.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its flowers, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through improved soil conditions. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by supporting a wide range of flora and fauna in its habitat.</p>
