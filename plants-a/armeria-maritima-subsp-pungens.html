<p>Armeria maritima subsp.</p>
<p>pungens, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and clusters of pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along rocky coastlines. Its leaves are linear and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils.</p>
