<p>Adromischus schaeferianus, commonly known as the Schaefer's ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, triangular leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adromischus schaeferianus has fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, measuring about 2-3 cm in length, with a bright green color that turns reddish under stress.</p>
<p>The stem is short and thick, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, star-shaped, and pinkish-white, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects.
