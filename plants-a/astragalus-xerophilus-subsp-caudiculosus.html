                    <h1>Astragalus xerophilus subsp. caudiculosus</h1>
<p>Astragalus xerophilus subsp.</p>
<p>caudiculosus, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, branching stems that often appear in dense tufts.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, narrow leaflets that help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient plant in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
