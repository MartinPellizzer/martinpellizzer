                <h1>Actinocephalus graminifolius</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus graminifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf actinocephalus, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense, terminal head, which gives it its common name. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus graminifolius has leaves that are narrow and grass-like in appearance, arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and covered with a smooth, pale green bark, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with yellow petals and a tubular structure, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus graminifolius is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in grassland and savanna ecosystems within these regions. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with open habitats. It is a herbaceous species that plays a role in the local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern parts of the African continent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus graminifolius was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as part of early agricultural and horticultural efforts. The plant has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found along roadsides and in open habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and has minimal impact on native ecosystems.</p>
