<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises vascular plants with a diverse range of forms, including ferns and horsetails. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large and diverse order of flowering plants that includes many species with unique morphological features. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with diverse growth forms and often contains toxic compounds. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvet plants" due to their soft, hairy leaves.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha sonderi is primarily native to the Cape Provinces.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the coastal and mountainous regions of this area. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including rocky outcrops and sandy soils. The Cape Provinces provide the ideal climate and environmental conditions for its growth.</p>
<p>It is an important part of the local flora and ecosystem in this region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha sonderi was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become naturalized in several regions across the country. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats, where it spreads through both seeds and vegetative propagation. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is considered a potential environmental weed in some parts of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Its distribution has been expanding, raising concerns about its impact on native ecosystems.</p>
