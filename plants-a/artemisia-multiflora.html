                    <h1>Artemisia multiflora</h1>
<p>Artemisia multiflora, commonly known as silverleaf artemisia, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Artemisia multiflora is often used in xeriscaping and has traditional uses in herbal medicine.</p>
