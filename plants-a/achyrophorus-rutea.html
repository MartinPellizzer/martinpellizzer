                <h1>Achyrophorus rutea</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus rutea, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits in native gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus rutea has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat woody, with a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and have a greenish-white color, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through mechanical means when it splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus rutea is a rare and specialized plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Tien Shan and Pamir-Alay ranges.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few remote areas in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. This plant is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, often in areas with well-drained soils and ample sunlight. It grows at altitudes ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat fragmentation and human disturbance, Achyrophorus rutea is considered endangered, with its population declining significantly in recent decades.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus rutea is a hardy perennial plant known for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rhizomes or by sowing seeds in early spring. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within two to three years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and pruning of dead foliage in late winter promote healthy growth. It is relatively pest- and disease-resistant but may attract slugs and snails.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus rutea is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species by improving soil conditions. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, making it beneficial in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achyrophorus rutea contributes to biodiversity by supporting a range of ecological interactions within its habitat.</p>
