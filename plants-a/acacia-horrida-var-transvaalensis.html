                        <h1>Acacia horrida var. transvaalensis</h1>
<p>Acacia horrida var. transvaalensis, commonly known as the Transvaal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its greyish bark and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by flat, fibrous pods. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local communities.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia horrida var. transvaalensis is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in savannas and rocky outcrops. This variant is well adapted to hot, dry climates with low rainfall. It is commonly seen in the Kalahari Desert and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its spiny thorns and yellow flowers, making it a distinctive feature of the landscape.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia horrida var. transvaalensis was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the eastern parts of the country, particularly in the grassland and savanna ecosystems. This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It has been introduced for ornamental purposes and as a potential source of timber.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities.</p>
