                    <h1>Acacia infecunda</h1>
<p>Acacia infecunda, commonly known as the ghost acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and small, feathery leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can endure prolonged periods of drought.</p>
<p>Acacia infecunda plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert organisms.</p>
