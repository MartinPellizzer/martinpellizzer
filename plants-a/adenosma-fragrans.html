                <h1>Adenosma fragrans</h1>
<p>Adenosma fragrans, commonly known as the sweet-scented shrub, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a pink or white color. Its leaves are typically opposite and elliptical, with a smooth texture.</p>
<p>Adenosma fragrans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma fragrans has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a smooth surface and a pointed tip.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows in a branching pattern. The flowers are fragrant, tubular, and clustered in inflorescences, typically pink or red in color, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma fragrans is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in forested areas and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often associated with secondary forests. It is also present in parts of Australia, particularly in the northern regions.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to humid, warm climates with high rainfall.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma fragrans was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions, often as an ornamental plant due to its fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several countries including India, Indonesia, and parts of Africa. The plant spreads primarily through seed dispersal by wind and water. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can form dense populations in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
