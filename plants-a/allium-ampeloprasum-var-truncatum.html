<p>Allium ampeloprasum var. truncatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf leek, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features elongated, bluish-green leaves that are broader than those of typical leeks, and it produces umbels of small, pale purple flowers. The plant is characterized by its swollen, bulb-like stem base, which is often used in culinary applications. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other allium species and is valued for both its ornamental and edible qualities.</p>
