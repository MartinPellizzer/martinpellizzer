                    <h1>Adiantum achilleifolium</h1>
<p>Adiantum achilleifolium, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, arching fronds that are dark green and often have a silvery underside. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-draining, humus-rich soil. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its fronds typically unfurl in a distinctive, fan-like pattern.</p>
<p>Adiantum achilleifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shady garden settings.</p>
