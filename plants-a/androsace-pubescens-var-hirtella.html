                    <h1>Androsace pubescens var. hirtella</h1>
<p>Androsace pubescens var. hirtella, commonly known as the hairy androsace, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features a dense mat of hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in rocky, alpine environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a characteristic species of alpine flora.</p>
