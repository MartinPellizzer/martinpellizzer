                <h1>Aegilops gussonei</h1>
<p>Aegilops gussonei, commonly known as the Gussone's wild einkorn, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the tribe Aegilopineae within the grass family Poaceae. This plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. It typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing adaptability to harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic similarity to cultivated einkorn, it is of interest in agricultural research for potential improvements in wheat breeding.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops gussonei has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a light green to yellowish color, growing upright from the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers that bloom in early summer, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the seeds are small and oval in shape.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the soil.</p>
