                    <h1>Agrostis tibestica</h1>
<p>Agrostis tibestica, commonly known as the Tibesti grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibesti Mountains in Chad.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or semi-desert habitats.</p>
<p>Agrostis tibestica plays a minor role in local ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing forage for grazing animals.</p>
