<p>Acanthocalycium thionanthum, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Sonoran Desert.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are often covered in a layer of white, waxy bloom. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It is a slow-growing, succulent plant that stores water in its stems to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in desert gardens.</p>
