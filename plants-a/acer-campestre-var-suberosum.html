                <h1>Acer campestre var. suberosum</h1>
<p>Acer campestre var. suberosum, commonly known as the hairy maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn yellow or orange in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or on slopes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant fall foliage and unique, hairy texture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. suberosum has simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are alternate in arrangement, typically 2–5 inches long and 1–3 inches wide, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a shrub-like growth pattern. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and arranged in clusters, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming in early spring, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. suberosum is a rare variant of the common horse chestnut, native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>While its original range was limited, it is now found in scattered locations across the Iberian Peninsula. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and open woodlands, often growing in sunny, well-drained environments. This species typically occurs at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited population size, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. suberosum is a hardy, slow-growing ornamental tree known for its distinctive bark and small, edible berries.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for germination. This species thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, loamy soil, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of balanced fertilizer in early spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs like viburnum or flowering shrubs can enhance its ornamental value and support beneficial insect habitats.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. suberosum is a valuable shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in woodland ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and promoting the growth of other native plants. Additionally, its dense root system helps with erosion control, preventing soil loss in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>This plant also contributes to nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil and benefiting surrounding vegetation.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. suberosum is a lesser-known variety of maple that has limited culinary use due to its small, bitter fruits, though it is occasionally used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
<p>Its bark and leaves have been explored for potential medicinal properties, such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, though scientific validation remains limited. Industrially, it contributes to ecological stability by supporting local wildlife and improving soil quality, which indirectly supports economic activities in forestry and conservation. Culturally, it holds symbolic value in certain regions, representing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Despite its modest profile, it plays a role in biodiversity and ecological restoration efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer campestre var. suberosum has several popular cultivars such as 'Columnare', known for its narrow, upright growth, and 'Erectum', which displays a striking red stem and vibrant autumn color.</p>
<p>It also has hybrids with other maple species, contributing to the development of ornamental trees with enhanced traits like improved cold hardiness and unique foliage. These varieties are valued in horticulture for their adaptability to various soil conditions and their ability to thrive in urban environments. Their aesthetic appeal makes them popular choices for landscaping and garden design.</p>
<p>Horticulturists often select these cultivars and hybrids for their ornamental value and resilience in different climates.</p>
