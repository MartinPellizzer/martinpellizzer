                <h1>Acianthera citrophila</h1>
<p>Acianthera citrophila, commonly known as the citron orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns resembling citrus fruits. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the forest floor.</p>
<p>Acianthera citrophila is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is prized for its ornamental value in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera citrophila has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a glossy green color, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth texture and a light green to reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera citrophila is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil.</p>
<p>It is found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans across eastern and northeastern regions of the country. This orchid thrives in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with rocky outcrops and secondary growth areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and threatened species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera citrophila was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and ornamental plant trade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides, gardens, and abandoned fields. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities and ecosystem balance.</p>
