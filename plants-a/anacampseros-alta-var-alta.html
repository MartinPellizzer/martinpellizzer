<p>Anacampseros alta var. alta, commonly known as the high mountain stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming structure with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in its native habitat.</p>
