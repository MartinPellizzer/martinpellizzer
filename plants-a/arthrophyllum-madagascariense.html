                    <h1>Arthrophyllum madagascariense</h1>
<p>Arthrophyllum madagascariense, commonly known as the Madagascar grass or Malagasy grass, is a perennial herb native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fibrous roots, which help it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by oval-shaped fruits. It is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is of interest to botanists studying endemic flora.</p>
