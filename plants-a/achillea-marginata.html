                <h1>Achillea marginata</h1>
<p>Achillea marginata, commonly known as yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that grows up to 1 meter tall, featuring a stout, hairy stem and basal leaves that are pinnately divided. The plant produces flat, clustered inflorescences of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in meadows and along roadsides.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea marginata has leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 5 to 15 centimeters in length, with a grayish-green color and a fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, herbaceous, and has a slightly rough texture, with a reddish-brown color that becomes more woody with age. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects. The fruit is a dry achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their small size and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea marginata is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly the Iberian Peninsula, and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is now found in various regions across the Mediterranean, including southern France, Italy, and parts of Turkey. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and wastelands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Currently, Achillea marginata is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, though it faces threats from habitat loss and urbanization.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea marginata is a hardy perennial known for its fluffy, yellow flower heads and silver foliage, commonly grown in gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late winter, though division is more reliable for maintaining varietal traits. The plant has a biennial growth cycle, producing flowers in its second year before dying back, though it often self-seeds and reappears annually.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with more frequent irrigation during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes growth, and pruning after flowering helps maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its appearance and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea marginata is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including birds and insects, by offering both nectar and shelter in its dense foliage. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its beneficial properties. Additionally, it helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Achillea marginata also contributes to ecological benefits by improving soil structure and promoting biodiversity in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea marginata is a versatile plant with a variety of uses and applications.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, it is used to flavor oils, vinegars, and sauces due to its aromatic properties.
