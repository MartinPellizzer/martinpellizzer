                    <h1>Anabasis tournefortii</h1>
<p>Anabasis tournefortii, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Anabasis tournefortii is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with minimal rainfall.</p>
