                <h1>Acorellus pallae</h1>
<p>Acorellus pallae, commonly known as the pale acorellus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Acanthaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorellus pallae has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and green, with a climbing growth pattern that allows it to ascend support structures. Its small, clustered flowers are white with five petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorellus pallae is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in the understory of rainforests. Its natural habitat includes areas with high humidity and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Acorellus pallae is an important component of the biodiversity in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorellus pallae was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with moderate to high sunlight exposure and well-drained soils. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas, making it a common pioneer species in ecological succession. Its introduction has been documented in several regions across the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential remains a topic of ongoing study and management.</p>
