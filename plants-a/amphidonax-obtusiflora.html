<p>Amphidonax obtusiflora, commonly known as the broad-flowered panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, broad, lance-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough, hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>Amphidonax obtusiflora is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native insects.</p>
