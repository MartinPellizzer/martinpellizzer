                    <h1>Amomum zambesiacum</h1>
<p>Amomum zambesiacum, commonly known as the Zambesia cardamom, is a member of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) native to eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, herbaceous stem and large, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces fragrant, three-lobed flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by spherical, three-lobed fruits containing aromatic seeds. Its essential oils, particularly those containing cineole, are valued for their medicinal and culinary uses.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species, prompting conservation efforts in its native regions.</p>
