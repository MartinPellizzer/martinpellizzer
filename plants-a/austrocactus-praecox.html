                    <h1>Austrocactus praecox</h1>
<p>Austrocactus praecox, commonly known as the early-flowering cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Austrocactus praecox is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and can withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and flowering habits make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
