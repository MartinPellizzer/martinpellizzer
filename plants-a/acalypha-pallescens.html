                <h1>Acalypha pallescens</h1>
<p>Acalypha pallescens, commonly known as the silverleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically arranged in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Acalypha pallescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acalypha pallescens has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly woody, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikes, featuring greenish-white bracts, and bloom during the summer months, likely pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-winged schizocarp, dispersing by wind due to its light weight and feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
