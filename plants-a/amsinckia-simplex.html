<p>Amsinckia simplex, commonly known as the desert smokeplant, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-green foliage with hairy surfaces, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>Amsinckia simplex is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
