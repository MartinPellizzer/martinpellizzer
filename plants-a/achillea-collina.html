                <h1>Achillea collina</h1>
<p>Achillea collina, commonly known as lesser yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and features finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and appear in flat-topped clusters.</p>
<p>Achillea collina is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea collina has basal leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape, arranged in a rosette, with a grayish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and slightly reddish-brown in color, growing from the base of the plant. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets and pale yellow disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to the presence of a pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea collina is a perennial herb native to Europe, particularly found in the mountainous regions of the Alps and Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Central and Eastern Europe, with some populations extending into western Asia. It thrives in open, sunny environments such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. This plant typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea collina is considered a species of conservation concern in several regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea collina is a hardy perennial plant known for its bright yellow flowers and fern-like foliage, commonly found in rocky and dry environments.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. The plant has a long growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and going dormant in winter, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, though it benefits from occasional deep watering during dry periods. Fertilization should be light, applied in early spring, and pruning involves cutting back the stems after flowering to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea collina is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also offers shelter and habitat for various insects and small wildlife species. This plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants by attracting beneficial insects. Additionally, its dense growth helps with erosion control by stabilizing soil in open areas.</p>
<p>Achillea collina contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving the health of local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
