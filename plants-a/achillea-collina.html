                <h1>Achillea collina</h1>
<p>Achillea collina, commonly known as lesser yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in summer. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, slightly hairy foliage and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Achillea collina is also valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea collina has leaves that are basal, forming a rosette, with a silvery-white underside and dark green upper surface, and are lanceolate in shape, ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown color, growing from the base to form a flowering spike. The flowers are composite, consisting of white ray florets and yellow disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a瘦果 (achene) with a pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea collina is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, particularly found in countries such as France, Spain, and Italy.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends to parts of North Africa and the Middle East, though its presence is more localized. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, or gravelly soils and is commonly found in open habitats like grasslands and disturbed areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Achillea collina is considered to be of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea collina is a hardy perennial plant known for its vibrant, flat-topped flower heads and fern-like foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer to early fall. This plant has a growth cycle that includes a dormant period in winter, followed by active growth and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. For optimal growth, apply a balanced fertilizer in early spring and prune spent flower heads to encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea collina is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, which rely on its flowers for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its beneficial properties. Additionally, its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Achillea collina also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health through its root system.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea collina is a flowering plant known for its various uses and applications across different fields.</p>
<p>In culinary applications, it is occasionally used as a herb, though its flavor is more subtle compared to other members of the Asteraceae family.
