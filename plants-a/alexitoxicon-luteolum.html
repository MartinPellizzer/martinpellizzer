                    <h1>Alexitoxicon luteolum</h1>
<p>Alexitoxicon luteolum, commonly known as the golden poison dart frog, is a strikingly colorful amphibian found in the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>Its vibrant yellow skin serves as a warning to predators about its toxic nature, which includes potent alkaloids such as batrachotoxin. The plant does not exist; the name is a misnomer, as Alexitoxicon luteolum is not a plant but an animal. This confusion highlights the importance of accurate botanical nomenclature.</p>
<p>If you were referring to a plant, please provide the correct scientific name for further information.</p>
