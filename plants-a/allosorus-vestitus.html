                    <h1>Allosorus vestitus</h1>
<p>Allosorus vestitus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. It has slender, leafless stems and is often found in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining population, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
