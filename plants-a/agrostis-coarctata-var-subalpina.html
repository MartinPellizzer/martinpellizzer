<p>Agrostis coarctata var. subalpina, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock and wildlife in high-altitude environments.</p>
