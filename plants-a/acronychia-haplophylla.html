                <h1>Acronychia haplophylla</h1>
<p>Acronychia haplophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acronychia, is a small evergreen tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It typically grows in coastal rainforests and is adapted to humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia haplophylla has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they are typically 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slightly woody, with a greyish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in axillary inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the cooler months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release bright red seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia haplophylla is primarily native to the northern parts of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the wet tropical rainforests of the Atherton Tablelands and adjacent areas. This species thrives in shaded, moist environments with rich, well-drained soil. It is often seen growing in the understory of dense forest canopies.</p>
<p>The plant is an important component of the local biodiversity in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia haplophylla was mainly introduced to coastal and riparian habitats in eastern Australia, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in subtropical and tropical regions, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded areas under the canopy of larger trees. This plant is typically associated with riverine forests and coastal dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna. Its distribution is largely limited to the eastern coast of Australia, including parts of Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for specific environmental conditions, it is not commonly found in inland or arid regions.</p>
