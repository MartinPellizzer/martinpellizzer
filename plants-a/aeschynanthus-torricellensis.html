                    <h1>Aeschynanthus torricellensis</h1>
<p>Aeschynanthus torricellensis, commonly known as the red-tipped orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that are often red or orange in color. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure.</p>
