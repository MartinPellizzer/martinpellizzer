                    <h1>Arceuthobium globosum</h1>
<p>Arceuthobium globosum, commonly known as the witch’s butter, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family and is characterized by its gelatinous, yellowish, and often foul-smelling fruiting bodies. The plant typically attaches to the roots of various woody plants, such as birch and alder, and can cause significant damage to its host. Its life cycle involves the release of sticky, spore-laden structures that adhere to the host’s roots.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and unique appearance, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in forest ecosystems.</p>
