                <h1>Actinocephalus velutinus</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus velutinus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or yellow in color. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Actinocephalus velutinus is known for its adaptability and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus velutinus has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a velvety texture and a dark green color on the upper surface, contrasting with a lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate in arrangement and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The stem is cylindrical, covered in a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom during the late spring to early summer, relying on wind for pollination.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus velutinus is primarily native to South America, specifically found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in humid, shaded environments within the undergrowth of forests. This plant is commonly found in the Amazon Basin and surrounding areas, where the climate supports its growth. It is typically associated with moist soils and can be found in both primary and secondary forest habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a regionally restricted species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus velutinus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, particularly in regions with a temperate climate.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments where competition from native vegetation is reduced, often colonizing roadsides, waste areas, and forest edges. This plant is commonly found in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and parts of Canada. Its introduction has been associated with human activities such as land development and transportation infrastructure.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if left unchecked.</p>
