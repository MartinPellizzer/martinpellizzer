                <h1>Acer crataegifolium var. macrophyllum</h1>
<p>Acer crataegifolium var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaf maple, is a variant of the hawthorn maple native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that can reach up to 10 centimeters in length, often with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially sunny environments.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer crataegifolium var. macrophyllum has leaves that are broadly ovate to rounded, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length; they are dark green on top and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a deciduous shrub or small tree. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicle clusters during spring, which are wind-pollinated; the flowers lack showy petals and are clustered closely together. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind; the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer crataegifolium var. macrophyllum is a rare and little-known maple species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While its original range was limited, it is now found in several botanical gardens and conservation centers outside its native habitat. This variant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in shaded forest understories. It typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, it is considered endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer crataegifolium var. macrophyllum is a striking ornamental tree known for its large, maple-like leaves and vibrant seasonal color changes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for optimal germination. The growth cycle involves rapid initial growth followed by a slower maturation phase, typically reaching maturity in 10-15 years.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and annual pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or sedum can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer crataegifolium var. macrophyllum is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing the growth of neighboring species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by adding organic matter to the soil when its leaves decompose.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer crataegifolium var. macrophyllum is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential nutritional benefits. In traditional medicine, the plant has been used to treat various ailments, though scientific validation is limited. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for wildlife.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic significance in certain regions, though its role in human symbolism is not well documented.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer crataegifolium var. macrophyllum has several notable cultivars, including 'Aureum' and 'Atropurpureum', which are prized for their striking foliage colors.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, such as Acer palmatum, to produce ornamental varieties with enhanced growth habits and coloration. These hybrids often exhibit improved cold hardiness and compact growth, making them popular in horticultural settings. The plant's unique leaf shape and vibrant autumn colors contribute to its horticultural importance in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Its cultivars and hybrids are widely cultivated for their aesthetic value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
