<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda thymifolia has simple, opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth surface and a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, somewhat hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that peels off in thin flakes as the plant matures. Its small, tubular flowers are typically violet or blue, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the rainy season; they are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and moderately deep, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
