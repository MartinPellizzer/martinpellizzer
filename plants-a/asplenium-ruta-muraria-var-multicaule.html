                    <h1>Asplenium ruta-muraria var. multicaule</h1>
<p>Asplenium ruta-muraria var. multicaule, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in rocky and calcareous environments.</p>
<p>It has a compact growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly curled. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in rows. It is often found in crevices or on walls, where it can absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its multiple stems, giving it a more bushy appearance compared to the typical form.</p>
