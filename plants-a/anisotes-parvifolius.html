                    <h1>Anisotes parvifolius</h1>
<p>Anisotes parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately divided, with small, ovate leaflets that contribute to its ornamental appeal in water gardens.</p>
