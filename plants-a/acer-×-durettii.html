                <h1>Acer × durettii</h1>
<p>Acer × durettii, commonly known as the Durettii maple, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Acer saccharum (sugar maple) and Acer negundo (mountain maple).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that are typically lobed and have a bronze or red hue in the autumn. The plant is native to North America and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant fall foliage and unique leaf patterns.</p>
<p>The Durettii maple is relatively hardy and adaptable, making it a popular choice for landscaping in various regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer × durettii has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are bright green during the growing season and turn vibrant yellow in autumn. The stem is smooth and slender, with a greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and clustered in catkins, with a yellowish-green color, blooming in early spring, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer × durettii is a hybrid maple species resulting from the cross between Acer saccharum and Acer rubrum.</p>
<p>It is native to the eastern United States, primarily found in regions of the Appalachian Mountains. Currently, its distribution extends across the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, though it is not widely cultivated outside its native range. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils in temperate deciduous forests, typically at altitudes between 300 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural occurrence and hybrid origin, Acer × durettii is considered a rare species with a conservation status that requires further study and protection.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer × durettii is a hybrid maple tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or grafting, with grafting being more common for maintaining specific traits. The growth cycle of Acer × durettii includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally suffer from scale insects or fungal infections.</p>
<p>Companion planting with plants like lavender or ornamental grasses can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>
