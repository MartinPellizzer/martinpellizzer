<p>Aristolochia cornuta, commonly known as the purple swallowwort, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that range from green to purple in color. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
