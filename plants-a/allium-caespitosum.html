<p>Allium caespitosum, commonly known as garlic chives, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often used in culinary applications for their mild garlic flavor. The plant produces small, spherical clusters of white or pink flowers in the summer, which are followed by bulbous structures containing numerous small cloves. Its root system consists of fibrous roots that help anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>Allium caespitosum is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and herb beds.</p>
