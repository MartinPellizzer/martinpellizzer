<p>Alchemilla villosa, commonly known as the velvet cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing, spreading habit with hairy, waxy leaves that give it a distinctive velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Alchemilla villosa is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
