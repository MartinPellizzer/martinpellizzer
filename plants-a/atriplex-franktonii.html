<p>Atriplex franktonii, commonly known as Frankton's saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typical of the Chenopodiaceae family. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity.</p>
<p>Atriplex franktonii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert organisms.</p>
