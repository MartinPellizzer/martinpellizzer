                        <h1>Acacia erinacea</h1>
<p>Acacia erinacea, commonly known as the hairy acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in savannas and rocky areas.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
