                    <h1>Apium dissectum</h1>
<p>Apium dissectum, commonly known as parsley weed or giant parsley, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely dissected, feather-like leaves that resemble those of parsley. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Apium dissectum is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and rhizomes.</p>
