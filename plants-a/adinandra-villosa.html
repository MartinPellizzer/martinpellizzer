                <h1>Adinandra villosa</h1>
<p>Adinandra villosa, commonly known as the hairy adinandra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa, including countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow and are clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>Adinandra villosa is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories or along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra villosa has leaves that are elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color on the upper surface with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, covered in a rough, grayish-brown bark, and grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra villosa is primarily native to Malaya and Myanmar.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Adinandra villosa is commonly associated with lowland and hill forests.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological niches in Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra villosa was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It has been introduced to several regions beyond its native range, including parts of the Pacific Islands and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>However, its spread is generally limited due to specific environmental requirements.</p>
