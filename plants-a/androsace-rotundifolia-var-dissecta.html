                    <h1>Androsace rotundifolia var. dissecta</h1>
<p>Androsace rotundifolia var. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features a dense mat of silver-gray foliage with ovate, toothed leaves that are finely dissected, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
