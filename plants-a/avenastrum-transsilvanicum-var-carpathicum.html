                    <h1>Avenastrum transsilvanicum var. carpathicum</h1>
<p>Avenastrum transsilvanicum var. carpathicum, commonly known as the Carpathian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
