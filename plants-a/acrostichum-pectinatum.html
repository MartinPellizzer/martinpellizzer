                <h1>Acrostichum pectinatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum pectinatum, commonly known as the broadleaf hanger fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are often used in traditional basketry and thatching. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its fronds are typically bright green and can grow up to several meters in length.</p>
<p>Acrostichum pectinatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in humid tropical ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pectinatum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are elongated, dark green on top, and lighter underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is sturdy and somewhat fibrous, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a creeping or trailing pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the soil and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pectinatum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas, swamps, and along riverbanks where there is consistent moisture. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems. Its distribution includes countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and the Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to coastal and brackish water conditions, making it an important component of these ecological systems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum pectinatum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions around the world, particularly in areas with high humidity and warm climates.</p>
<p>It has been established in parts of the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia, and the Caribbean. This plant is often found in coastal areas, mangroves, and wetlands where it thrives in saline and waterlogged soils. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its potential invasive nature in certain environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in landscaping and as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
