<p>Agrostis borealis subsp.</p>
<p>hyperborea, commonly known as the Arctic grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to long periods of cold and limited sunlight, making it a key component of polar ecosystems.</p>
