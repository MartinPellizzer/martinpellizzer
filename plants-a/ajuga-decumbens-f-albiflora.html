                    <h1>Ajuga decumbens f. albiflora</h1>
<p>Ajuga decumbens f. albiflora, commonly known as whiteflower bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial groundcover plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, oval leaves that are often hairy to the touch. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early to mid-summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it effective for soil stabilization and erosion control.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or along stream banks.</p>
