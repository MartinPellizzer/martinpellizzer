                <h1>Acleisanthes angustifolia</h1>
<p>Acleisanthes angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Acleisanthes angustifolia is adapted to drought conditions and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes angustifolia has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright and branched. Its flowers are tubular, with a bright yellow color, blooming in spring and summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes angustifolia is primarily native to Mexico Northeast and Texas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the edges of desert scrub and grasslands. It is well adapted to the dry climate and can thrive in low-water environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely confined to the southern and western parts of Texas and the northeastern regions of Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes angustifolia was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. This plant is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread and manage its impact in affected areas.</p>
