                <h1>Adenocalymma reticulatum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant has a shrub-like growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions and sandy soils.</p>
<p>The flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and birds, contributing to its ecological importance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma reticulatum has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5-10 cm in length with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, somewhat woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as an upright shrub. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma reticulatum is primarily native to eastern Australia, specifically the states of New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and lowland regions, particularly in areas with sandy or loamy soils. This plant thrives in open habitats such as heathlands, woodlands, and coastal dunes. It is often associated with areas that have a temperate to subtropical climate.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma reticulatum is well adapted to the environmental conditions of its native range, including periodic droughts and salt-laden winds.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma reticulatum was mainly introduced to the western and central regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along coastal areas and inland dunes. This plant has adapted well to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its introduced range. It is often seen growing in open habitats such as sandplains and grasslands.</p>
<p>Its introduction has had minimal impact on native ecosystems, though it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
