                    <h1>Anticlea</h1>
<p>Anticlea, commonly known as the moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. Anticlea species are characterized by their large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, and the fruits are berries that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to their nocturnal blooming habit and ornamental value, Anticlea plants are often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
