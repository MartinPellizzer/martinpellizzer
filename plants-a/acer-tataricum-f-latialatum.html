                <h1>Acer tataricum f. latialatum</h1>
<p>Acer tataricum f. latialatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maple, is a variant of the Tatarian maple.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive broad, palmately lobed leaves that are often more pronounced than those of the typical species. The plant is native to regions of Eastern Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse by wind.</p>
<p>This ornamental tree is valued for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum f. latialatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with yellowish-green sepals and reddish stamens, blooming in late spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, with two wings, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum f. latialatum is a rare variant of the Tatarian maple, native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia, including parts of China, Korea, and Russia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited, with populations found primarily in specific areas of China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan. It thrives in temperate to cool climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils within mixed forests or along riverbanks. This species typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Acer tataricum f. latialatum is considered a vulnerable species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum f. latialatum is a striking ornamental tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and unique growth habits.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings offering a more reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. This species exhibits a moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 10 to 15 years, with steady growth during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while pruning should focus on shaping and removing dead or diseased branches. It is relatively resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic value and promote a diverse ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum f. latialatum is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its root system. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root network that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to improving soil quality by preventing nutrient leaching.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum f. latialatum is a lesser-known plant with limited direct culinary or medicinal use, though its ornamental value makes it popular in horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has no significant industrial or economic applications due to its small size and low yield. Culturally, it is not widely recognized for symbolic meanings, though it contributes to local biodiversity and ecological balance. Its role in supporting wildlife and maintaining forest ecosystems is more important than its human-use applications.</p>
<p>Overall, its primary value lies in its aesthetic appeal and ecological function rather than practical utility.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum f. latialatum has a variety of cultivars that are highly valued in horticulture, including 'Crimson King' and 'Autumn Flame,' which are known for their vibrant fall colors.</p>
<p>This form is also frequently used in hybridization to create new maple varieties with improved traits such as enhanced fall color or better cold hardiness. Hybrids involving Acer tataricum f. latialatum often combine the ornamental qualities of its parent species with increased adaptability to different climates. Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to add seasonal interest to gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic appeal and resilience, it remains a popular choice among landscape designers and gardeners.</p>
