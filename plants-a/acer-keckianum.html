<p>Acer keckianum, commonly known as the Keck's maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
