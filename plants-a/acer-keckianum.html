                <h1>Acer keckianum</h1>
<p>Acer keckianum, commonly known as the Keck's maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer keckianum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a spreading, shrub-like pattern. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers in early spring, with a simple structure consisting of five petals, and they are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer keckianum is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of central China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>Although it was once more widely distributed, its current range is severely restricted, with only a few small populations remaining. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in subtropical and temperate forests. This species grows at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acer keckianum is classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer keckianum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. The growth cycle includes a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are recommended for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot under poor conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer keckianum is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a diverse range of flora and fauna.</p>
