                <h1>Acer keckianum</h1>
<p>Acer keckianum, commonly known as the Keck maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree typically grows to a height of 8â€“12 meters and has smooth, gray bark. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer keckianum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin, alternate arrangement, and a size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a shrub-like form. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during spring, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, shaded environments where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer keckianum is a rare tree species native to the mountainous regions of southern China, specifically in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Hengduan Mountains. It thrives in humid, temperate environments with well-drained soil and partial shade. This species typically grows at altitudes between 2,000 and 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Acer keckianum is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer keckianum is a unique maple species known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a period of cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer keckianum includes a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may suffer from aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or daffodils can help deter pests and enhance garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer keckianum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy red flowers. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration, offering long-term ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer keckianum is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine. The tree's wood is not widely utilized in industrial settings due to its limited availability and softness. It holds cultural significance in certain regions, where it is appreciated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and natural landscapes.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer keckianum primarily serves as an ornamental and ecological plant, contributing to biodiversity and landscape beauty.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer keckianum has a limited number of naturally occurring varieties, but it is primarily known for its ornamental value rather than a wide range of cultivars.</p>
<p>Some popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Variegatum', which are appreciated for their striking foliage colors. While direct hybrids of Acer keckianum are rare, it has been used in crosses with other maple species to create unique hybrids with enhanced horticultural traits. These hybrids often exhibit improved cold hardiness and vibrant autumn colors, making them valuable in landscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability, Acer keckianum holds significant horticultural importance in gardens and parks worldwide.</p>
