<p>Acicalyptus eugenioides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed eucalyptus, is a tall, slender tree native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The flowers are small, white or pale blue, and clustered in umbels, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It produces woody capsules that contain aromatic, egg-shaped seeds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its timber and is also used in horticulture for its ornamental qualities.</p>
