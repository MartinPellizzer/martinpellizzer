                        <h1>Acacia verticillata subsp. cephalantha</h1>
<p>Acacia verticillata subsp.</p>
<p>cephalantha, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf-like structures that reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in dunes or along the coast.</p>
<p>The species is well adapted to coastal environments and is an important part of the local flora.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia verticillata subsp.</p>
<p>cephalantha belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true stems, roots, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses ferns and their relatives, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction.</p>
<p>Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with a wide range of morphological diversity. Its order is Fabales, which comprises plants such as legumes and vetches, typically characterized by compound leaves and flowers with a distinctive structure. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, recognized for its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees native to Africa, Australia, and the Americas, often featuring phyllodes instead of leaves.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia verticillata, a specific type within the Acacia genus, distinguished by its unique branching pattern and is a subspecies of Acacia cephalantha.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia verticillata subsp.</p>
<p>cephalantha is primarily native to Victoria. This subspecies is found in the coastal regions of Victoria, Australia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly seen in dune environments. The plant is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of the region.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia verticillata subsp.</p>
<p>cephalantha was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in coastal or inland regions with a Mediterranean climate. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, dunes, and open woodlands.</p>
<p>This subspecies is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces, making it a potential invasive species in some regions. It is often used for erosion control and as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and yellow flowers.</p>
<p>However, its spread can sometimes outcompete native vegetation, raising concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
