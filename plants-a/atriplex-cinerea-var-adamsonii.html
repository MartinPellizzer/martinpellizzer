                    <h1>Atriplex cinerea var. adamsonii</h1>
<p>Atriplex cinerea var. adamsonii, commonly known as silverleaf shadscale, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves and stems store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range.</p>
