                <h1>Acrostichum teysmannianum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum teysmannianum, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is characterized by its broad, floating fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a distinctive rhizome system that anchors it in the water and supports its extensive growth. Its fronds are divided into small, lance-shaped pinnae, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing water quality.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum teysmannianum has large, pinnately compound leaves that are broad, lance-shaped, and dark green, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that grows in a climbing or trailing pattern. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers with three sepals and three petals, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-valved capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the seeds are small and dry.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant, especially in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum teysmannianum is primarily native to the Indo-Pacific region, including Southeast Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical coastal areas, often found in mangrove swamps and salt marshes. This plant is well adapted to brackish water conditions and can tolerate high salinity levels. It is commonly found in countries such as Indonesia, the Philippines, and Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with coastal ecosystems where it plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum teysmannianum was mainly introduced to coastal and wetland areas where it thrives in humid, saline environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high rainfall and poor soil drainage. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system. However, it can become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impacts in non-native habitats.</p>
