                <h1>Achillea macrophylla</h1>
<p>Achillea macrophylla, commonly known as yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and dense clusters of small, flat-topped flower heads. The plant features feathery, aromatic leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Achillea macrophylla is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea macrophylla has basal leaves that are broadly lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a silvery-gray underside due to fine hairs, arranged in a rosette formation, and can reach up to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and slightly woody at the base, with a grayish-green color and a growth pattern that is typically clump-forming. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray flowers, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea macrophylla is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean area, including parts of Spain, France, and Italy.</p>
<p>While it was originally confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including North America and Australia, often as an ornamental plant. This species thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes and open woodlands, typically at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and over-collection for horticultural use, Achillea macrophylla is considered vulnerable in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea macrophylla is a hardy perennial known for its showy, flat-topped flower heads and feathery foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a dormant growth cycle, going through active growth in spring and early summer, followed by a rest period in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune spent flowers to encourage rebloom and maintain shape. It is generally pest and disease resistant, though it may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea macrophylla is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife including birds and insects that rely on its flowers for food. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through its aromatic properties. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by offering habitat and sustenance to various species in its ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea macrophylla is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value and historical significance.</p>
<p>It has been used in traditional medicine to treat ailments such as wounds, inflammation, and digestive issues.
