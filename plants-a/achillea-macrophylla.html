                <h1>Achillea macrophylla</h1>
<p>Achillea macrophylla, commonly known as the yarrow or giant yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and large, flat clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its historical use dates back to ancient times, where it was valued for its healing properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea macrophylla has large, broadly lance-shaped leaves that are bright green on top and silvery white underneath, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a grayish-green bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are flat, composite umbels composed of small yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, and the plant has a deep taproot system that helps it thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea macrophylla is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees, Alps, and Carpathian ranges.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited, with populations now mostly restricted to isolated regions in France and Spain. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and woodland edges, typically at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered vulnerable, with some populations facing threats from urbanization and climate change.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and restore its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea macrophylla is a hardy perennial known for its striking silver-green foliage and bright yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. The plant has a long growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune dead flowers to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or spider mites in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea macrophylla is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing well alongside other native flora in garden and wild settings. It also helps with erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall biodiversity and ecological balance of its habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea macrophylla is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value in gardens and landscaping due to its attractive, feathery flowers.</p>
