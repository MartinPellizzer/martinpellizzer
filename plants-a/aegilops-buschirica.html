<p>Aegilops buschirica, commonly known as the Buschiri grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the tribe Aegilopineae within the grass family Poaceae. The plant is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brownish florets.</p>
<p>Aegilops buschirica is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for forage or soil stabilization.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops buschirica has narrow, grass-like leaves that are elongated, slightly curved, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, pale green to white florets, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed spikelet that disperses its seeds by wind, with each seed having a small, wing-like appendage.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
