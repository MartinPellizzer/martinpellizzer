                <h1>Acidanthera zanzibarica</h1>
<p>Acidanthera zanzibarica, commonly known as the Zanzibar lily, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has strap-shaped leaves and produces inflorescences that consist of several small, clustered flowers. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections worldwide.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidanthera zanzibarica has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly woody, with a light green bark that has a smooth and slightly glossy surface. Its flowers are bell-shaped, with a white to pale blue color, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidanthera zanzibarica is primarily native to the coastal regions of East Africa, particularly the island of Zanzibar and nearby areas such as Pemba and Mafia.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal forests and sandy soils. This plant is commonly associated with mangrove ecosystems and is well adapted to brackish water conditions. It is also occasionally found in parts of coastal Tanzania and Kenya.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidanthera zanzibarica was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its striking pink and white flowers. The plant thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, making it well-suited to the climate of these regions. It has since become naturalized in some areas, posing a potential threat to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the impact of human activity on plant distribution and ecosystem dynamics.</p>
