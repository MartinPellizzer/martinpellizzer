                <h1>Acourtia glandulifera</h1>
<p>Acourtia glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular acourtia, is a flowering plant native to California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. It features small, glandular-dotted leaves and produces yellow to orange flowers.</p>
<p>Acourtia glandulifera is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia glandulifera has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture, ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and grows upright with a branching pattern, typically ranging in color from green to reddish-brown. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with five pink to purple petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia glandulifera is primarily native to Guatemala.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within forests. It is part of the Asteraceae family and is known for its small, clustered flowers.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely restricted to specific areas within Guatemala's diverse ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia glandulifera was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and compact growth habit. However, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native vegetation in disturbed areas. Its rapid spread has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its population and prevent further spread.</p>
