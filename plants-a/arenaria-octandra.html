<p>Arenaria octandra, commonly known as the eight-angled sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Arenaria octandra plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and alpine meadows.</p>
