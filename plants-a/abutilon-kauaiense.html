                        <h1>Abutilon kauaiense</h1>
<p>Abutilon kauaiense, commonly known as Kauai velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves and showy, yellow-centered flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon kauaiense is primarily native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii.</p>
<p>This species is endemic to the Hawaiian archipelago and is found in specific habitats on Kauai. It typically grows in wet to mesic forest environments, often near streams or in areas with high humidity. Due to habitat loss and other threats, it is considered endangered.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to protect and preserve this unique plant.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon kauaiense was mainly introduced to Hawaii, specifically the island of Kauai, where it has become naturalized in certain habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides, forests edges, and along streambanks. This plant is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to monitor and control its spread in sensitive habitats.</p>
