                <h1>Acridocarpus alternifolius</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus alternifolius, commonly known as the white flame tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Anacardiaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its palm-like leaves and showy, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, orange pulp. It thrives in tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate and may have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus alternifolius has alternate, simple leaves that are elliptic in shape, ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light gray bark that becomes rough with age. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from November to February, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus alternifolius is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is currently found primarily in the eastern part of the island, where it grows in humid, lowland rainforest environments. The species typically thrives at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,000 meters above sea level. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve this unique species in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus alternifolius is a tropical plant known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining desirable traits. The growth cycle of this plant is relatively rapid, with new shoots emerging in spring and reaching maturity within a few months.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced liquid fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain its shape and encourage new growth. Common pests include aphids and mealybugs, while fungal diseases can occur in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and enhance overall garden health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus alternifolius is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the pollination of other plants in the ecosystem. It acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants by improving soil conditions. Additionally, its dense foliage helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil on slopes and along waterways.</p>
<p>This plant also plays a role in maintaining biodiversity by offering a habitat and food source for multiple ecological communities.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus alternifolius is a versatile plant with a range of uses and applications across various domains.</p>
