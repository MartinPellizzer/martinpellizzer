<p>Alnus incana subsp.</p>
<p>tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in width.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
