                <h1>Adesmia candida</h1>
<p>Adesmia candida, commonly known as the white-flowered legume, is a small shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Adesmia candida is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>It is often used in local horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia candida has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are simple, white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia candida is primarily native to Argentina Northeast and Argentina South.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in grassland and shrubland habitats within these regions. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Adesmia candida is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of these areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these geographic regions due to environmental and climatic factors.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia candida was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and horticulture.</p>
<p>It thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in areas with poor vegetation cover. This plant is often found in urban environments, along roadsides, and in degraded ecosystems. Its introduction has led to competition with native species in some regions.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in parts of its range.</p>
