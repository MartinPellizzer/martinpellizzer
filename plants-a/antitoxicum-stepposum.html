<p>Antitoxicum stepposum, commonly known as the steppe antitoxic, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the steppes of Eastern Europe and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features wiry stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or white flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to dry, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>While not widely cultivated, it has been studied for its potential medicinal properties due to its reported detoxifying effects.</p>
