                    <h1>Aeschynomene sublignosa</h1>
<p>Aeschynomene sublignosa, commonly known as smallleaf aeschynomene, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically small and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, spherical seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>Aeschynomene sublignosa is also valued for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to tolerate and accumulate heavy metals.</p>
