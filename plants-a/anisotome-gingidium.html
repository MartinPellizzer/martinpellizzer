<p>Anisotome gingidium, commonly known as the narrowleaf germander, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, often hairy stems that grow upright and bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom during the cooler months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
