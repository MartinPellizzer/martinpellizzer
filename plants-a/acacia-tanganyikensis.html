                        <h1>Acacia tanganyikensis</h1>
<p>Acacia tanganyikensis, commonly known as the East African wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to the eastern African region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular inflorescences, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local communities.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia tanganyikensis is primarily native to the eastern African region, specifically Tanzania and the neighboring areas of Lake Tanganyika.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal and lowland areas of Tanzania, particularly in the southern and central parts of the country. This species thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often associated with coastal vegetation. It is also present in parts of Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Zambia.</p>
<p>Acacia tanganyikensis is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
