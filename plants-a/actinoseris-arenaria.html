                <h1>Actinoseris arenaria</h1>
<p>Actinoseris arenaria, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal plains. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Actinoseris arenaria plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for native insects and small animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinoseris arenaria has leaves that are typically small, narrow, and linear in shape, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a grayish-green color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slightly woody, with a reddish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly cracked, growing in a low, compact shrub form. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, with a tubular structure and no petals, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to stabilize the plant in sandy or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinoseris arenaria is primarily native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States, including parts of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the shoreline and in dune habitats. This plant is commonly found in areas with high salinity and is adapted to withstand strong coastal winds and salt spray. It plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is often considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinoseris arenaria was mainly introduced to coastal dune environments where it thrives in sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high salinity and strong wind exposure. This plant plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes by reducing erosion. Its introduction has been documented in several coastal areas along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.</p>
<p>However, its spread can sometimes lead to competition with native plant species.</p>
