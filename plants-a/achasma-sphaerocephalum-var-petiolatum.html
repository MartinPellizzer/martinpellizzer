                    <h1>Achasma sphaerocephalum var. petiolatum</h1>
<p>Achasma sphaerocephalum var. petiolatum, commonly known as the petioled globe lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, rounded thallus with a dense, velvety texture.</p>
<p>It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. The thallus is usually green to yellowish-green, with a central, rounded lobes and a petioled structure that gives it its varietal name. It lacks true leaves but has a complex arrangement of photobionts and fungal hyphae that contribute to its photosynthetic and structural functions.</p>
<p>This lichen is of interest to mycologists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
