<p>Allocasuarina eriochlamys subsp.</p>
<p>eriochlamys, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, spine-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in woody cones and are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in coastal stabilization due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in sandy soils.</p>
