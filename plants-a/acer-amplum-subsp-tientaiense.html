                <h1>Acer amplum subsp. tientaiense</h1>
<p>Acer amplum subsp.</p>
<p>tientaiense, commonly known as the Tiantai maple, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in mountainous regions and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring.</p>
<p>The Tiantai maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer amplum subsp.</p>
<p>tientaiense has palmate leaves that are typically 5â€“9 lobed, with a broad, rounded shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 5 to 12 cm in length. The stem is slender with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, clustered in cymes, with yellowish-green petals and stamens, blooming in early spring, and are primarily wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer amplum subsp.</p>
<p>tientaiense is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of central China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan and Hubei. Its current distribution is limited to specific areas in these regions, where it grows in moist, temperate forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with well-drained soil and moderate humidity, typically found in mixed deciduous forests. This subspecies is usually found at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is classified as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer amplum subsp.</p>
<p>tientaiense is a rare and ornamental maple species that thrives in temperate climates. It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of this plant is slow, with new growth appearing in spring and foliage turning vibrant colors in autumn.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization should be done in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, while pruning is minimal, focusing on shaping and removing dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials like hostas or ferns can enhance its ornamental value in the garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer amplum subsp.</p>
<p>tientaiense is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects. It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to the health of local ecosystems.</p>
<p>This species acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a wide range of organisms. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the ground in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it plays a role in improving soil quality by fixing nitrogen, benefiting surrounding plants and promoting overall ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer amplum subsp.</p>
<p>tientaiense is a lesser-known maple species with limited documented uses and applications. Its wood, though not widely utilized commercially, may have niche applications in small-scale woodworking or artistic crafts.</p>
<p>There is limited evidence of its use in traditional medicine, though some local communities may use it for herbal remedies. Culturally, it may hold symbolic value in certain regions, though this is not well documented.</p>
<p>Overall, its role in culinary, industrial, and economic contexts remains largely unexplored.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer amplum subsp.</p>
<p>tientaiense has a limited number of varieties, but it is known for its ornamental value and has several popular cultivars such as 'Crimson Queen' and 'Orange Star,' which are favored for their vibrant autumn colors. While it is less commonly hybridized compared to other maple species, some crosses with related maples have produced unique foliage patterns.</p>
<p>Its horticultural importance lies in its ability to thrive in shaded environments and its striking seasonal display, making it a desirable choice for landscape design. Due to its rarity and specific growing conditions, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and botanical collections.</p>
<p>This subspecies contributes to the diversity of maple trees in horticulture, particularly in regions with moist, cool climates.</p>
