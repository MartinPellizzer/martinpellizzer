                    <h1>Atriplex wolfii var. tenuissima</h1>
<p>Atriplex wolfii var. tenuissima, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, a key adaptation to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Its salt-excreting leaves help it thrive in saline soils, contributing to its ecological importance in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
