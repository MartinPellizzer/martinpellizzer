                    <h1>Acacia stenocarpa var. boboensis</h1>
<p>Acacia stenocarpa var. boboensis, commonly known as the Bobo acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow, globular inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in woody pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed or dry soils.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to harsh environments, displaying drought tolerance and efficient water use.</p>
