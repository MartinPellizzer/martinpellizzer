<p>Aethionema gypsicola, commonly known as the saltbush or gypsum plant, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its rocky habitat. Aethionema gypsicola is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
