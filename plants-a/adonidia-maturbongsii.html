                <h1>Adonidia maturbongsii</h1>
<p>Adonidia maturbongsii, commonly known as the Philippine orchid tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its showy, pendulous flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is known for its rapid growth and is often cultivated as an ornamental tree due to its vibrant orange and yellow blooms. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Adonidia maturbongsii is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonidia maturbongsii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>Its stem is cylindrical, covered with a smooth, reddish-brown bark, and exhibits an erect growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil and aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonidia maturbongsii is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of this island, particularly in the lowland rainforests. The plant thrives in humid and warm climates with high levels of rainfall. It is commonly observed in the eastern and western parts of New Guinea.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonidia maturbongsii was mainly introduced to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the lowland areas of Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments near streams and riverbanks. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
