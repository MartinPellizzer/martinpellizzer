                    <h1>Alisma odoratum</h1>
<p>Alisma odoratum, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often with a faintly fragrant scent. Its rhizomatous root system helps it thrive in water-saturated soils, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Alisma odoratum plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
