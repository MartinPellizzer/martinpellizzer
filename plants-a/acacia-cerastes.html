                    <h1>Acacia cerastes</h1>
<p>Acacia cerastes, commonly known as the African thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, globular clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Acacia cerastes plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing shelter and food for various animals.</p>
