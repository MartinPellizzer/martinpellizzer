                <h1>Acer tataricum f. rubrum</h1>
<p>Acer tataricum f. rubrum, commonly known as the red maple or red-flowering maple, is a decorative shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red or pink flowers that appear in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, with a serrated margin, and turn vibrant shades of red in the fall. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its ornamental value and adaptability to various garden conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum f. rubrum has palmately lobed leaves that are typically red or orange-red in color, with a smooth texture and a maple-like shape, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it exhibits a vertical growth pattern. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in clusters during early spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring and nutrient absorption in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum f. rubrum is a variant of the Tatarian maple, native to eastern and central Europe, including parts of Russia and the Balkans.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to specific regions in Europe, particularly in southern and central areas. It thrives in temperate climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils in woodlands or along riverbanks. This species typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its restricted distribution and habitat specificity make it vulnerable to environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum f. rubrum is a decorative maple known for its vibrant red foliage, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining cultivar traits. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in 5â€“10 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to shape the tree and remove dead wood. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials like hostas or shrubs like rhododendrons can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a healthy garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum f. rubrum is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its vibrant red leaves and nectar-rich flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved soil conditions. Its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to biodiversity by offering habitat and food resources in forest edge environments.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum f. rubrum is a decorative plant commonly used in landscaping and ornamental horticulture for its vibrant red foliage.</p>
<p>While it is not typically used in culinary applications, its wood has been historically valued for small-scale woodworking and crafting. In traditional medicine, it has been used in some regions for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Culturally, it symbolizes autumn and is often featured in artistic and symbolic representations.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological settings also supports local wildlife by providing shelter and food sources.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum f. rubrum has several popular cultivars such as 'Kirk,' 'Red Baron,' and 'Orange Emperor,' which are prized for their vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>These cultivars are often selected for their enhanced coloration and compact growth habits. Hybrids of Acer tataricum f. rubrum have been developed to improve hardiness and ornamental value, combining traits from related species. Horticulturally, this species is important for its ornamental potential in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Its varieties and hybrids contribute significantly to the diversity of maple trees in cultivation.</p>
