                            <h1>Astragalus Molybdenus</h1>
<p>Astragalus molybdenus is a rare and specialized plant found in arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the legume family and is known for its unique adaptations to harsh environments. This species is particularly notable for its association with heavy metal soils due to its ability to hyperaccumulate molybdenum. Its survival depends on specific ecological conditions that limit its distribution. Studying Astragalus molybdenus offers insights into plant resilience and environmental tolerance.</p>
