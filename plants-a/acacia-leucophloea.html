                        <h1>Acacia leucophloea</h1>
<p>Acacia leucophloea, commonly known as the white-wood acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular heads, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing on rocky soils.</p>
<p>Acacia leucophloea is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia leucophloea is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in savannas, woodlands, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often part of the vegetation in dry and semi-arid environments. It is also present in parts of the Arabian Peninsula and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>Acacia leucophloea plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia leucophloea was mainly introduced to areas with warm, dry climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental or for its hardy nature.</p>
<p>It has been distributed in regions such as parts of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. The plant is commonly found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in degraded landscapes. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological impacts, including competition with native species.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive potential in some regions, it is valued for its ability to thrive in challenging environments.</p>
