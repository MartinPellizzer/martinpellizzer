<p>Arctium tomentosum, commonly known as the hairy burdock, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces purple to brown flowers arranged in composite inflorescences, which are followed by spiky, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>The hairy burdock is also a common weed in disturbed soils and gardens.</p>
