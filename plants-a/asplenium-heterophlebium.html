                    <h1>Asplenium heterophlebium</h1>
<p>Asplenium heterophlebium, commonly known as the variable spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, often finely divided fronds that can vary in shape and size depending on environmental conditions. Native to regions of Europe, Asia, and Africa, this plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on adaptation and morphology in ferns.</p>
