                <h1>Adiantum lyratum</h1>
<p>Adiantum lyratum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and have a graceful, arching appearance. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are wiry and often covered in a fine, silky coating.</p>
<p>Adiantum lyratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum lyratum has delicate, fern-like leaves that are bipinnate, with a lyrate shape, and arranged in a pinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically light green, with a waxy surface, and can reach up to 30 cm in length. The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, appearing in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The fruit is a sorus containing spores, and the plant disperses its spores through wind, rather than producing seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum lyratum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. This fern thrives in regions with high rainfall and moderate temperatures. It is often seen growing along the edges of water bodies or in moist, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum lyratum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. This plant is often seen growing along the edges of streams and in areas with high humidity. Its delicate, fern-like fronds make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
