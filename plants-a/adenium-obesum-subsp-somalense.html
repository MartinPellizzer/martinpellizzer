                <h1>Adenium obesum subsp. somalense</h1>
<p>Adenium obesum subsp.</p>
<p>somalense, commonly known as the "Bottle Tree" or "Desert Trumpet," is a succulent shrub native to the Horn of Africa. It is characterized by its swollen, bulbous trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to extreme drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenium obesum subsp.</p>
<p>somalense has thick, fleshy leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a moderate size. The stem is swollen and bottle-shaped, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically a deep reddish-brown or grayish color.</p>
<p>Its flowers are large, showy, and either yellow or orange in color, with a tubular shape and a scent that attracts pollinators like bees and birds; they bloom during the dry season. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and robust, adapted to store water and nutrients in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenium obesum subsp.</p>
<p>somalense is a unique plant native to the Horn of Africa, specifically Somalia and southern Ethiopia. Its current distribution includes parts of Kenya, Tanzania, and the Arabian Peninsula, though it is less common in these areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, such as coastal plains and sandy soils. This subspecies typically grows at low altitudes, ranging from sea level up to about 500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable, and conservation efforts are ongoing to protect its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adenium obesum subsp.</p>
<p>somalense is a striking succulent known for its thick, swollen trunk and vibrant flowers. It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or division, with stem cuttings being the most reliable method.</p>
<p>This plant has a slow growth cycle, thriving in warm, arid climates and requiring minimal care once established. It prefers well-draining soil and infrequent watering to avoid root rot, with fertilization applied sparingly during the growing season. Pruning is necessary to maintain shape and encourage flowering, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by scale insects or mealybugs.</p>
<p>Companion planting with cacti or other succulents can enhance its growth in a dry garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
