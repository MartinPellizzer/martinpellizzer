<p>Asterocephalus rupestris, commonly known as the rock aster, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, typically during the summer months. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun exposure, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts.</p>
