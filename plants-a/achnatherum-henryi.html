                <h1>Achnatherum henryi</h1>
<p>Achnatherum henryi, commonly known as Henry's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Achnatherum henryi is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky and arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achnatherum henryi has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and range in length from 10 to 30 centimeters with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is usually clumping or spreading. The flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, pale green to yellowish florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-angled achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and hairy structures.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum henryi is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and western China, including the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude grasslands and alpine meadows where the climate is cold and arid. This species is commonly found in regions such as Sichuan, Yunnan, Qinghai, and Tibet. It is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Achnatherum henryi plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achnatherum henryi was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental grass.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the western states, particularly in California and Oregon. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance. However, it has the potential to become invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is primarily limited by climate and soil conditions.</p>
