<p>Antennaria friesiana subsp.</p>
<p>friesiana, commonly known as the Friesian bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, hairy stems and clustered, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white.</p>
<p>The plant's leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, windy environments. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
