<p>Aristida stipitata var. spicata, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open grasslands and rocky areas, exhibiting a compact growth habit with slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are usually pale green to brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
