                <h1>Adamanthus fragrans</h1>
<p>Adamanthus fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family and is known for its aromatic scent, which is particularly noticeable when the flowers are in bloom. Adamanthus fragrans typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters.</p>
<p>Its leaves are large, palmately lobed, and often have a velvety texture, adding to its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adamanthus fragrans has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface that contrasts with a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem and measure approximately 10–15 cm in length. The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively unbranched until the plant matures. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in panicles, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees.</p>
<p>The fruit is a drupe that splits open to release smooth, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adamanthus fragrans is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Central and South America, though it is less commonly found outside its native range. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and understories, often growing near rivers and streams. Adamanthus fragrans is typically found at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to about 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited cultivation, it is considered a species of concern and is listed as near threatened by some conservation organizations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adamanthus fragrans is a flowering plant known for its delicate, fragrant blooms and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing mature clumps, with seeds requiring a period of cold stratification for germination. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 3 to 5 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourage blooming. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden’s aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
