                <h1>Aconitum paniculatum</h1>
<p>Aconitum paniculatum, commonly known as the European monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking purple-blue flowers arranged in a tall, conical inflorescence. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Aconitum paniculatum contains potent alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring caution during handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum paniculatum has leaves that are compound, consisting of several lance-shaped leaflets arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is tall, upright, and often branched, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in panicles, with showy spurred petals and a distinctive structure that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies; they bloom in late summer. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, often forming a dense network that helps the plant store nutrients and survive harsh conditions.</p>
