<p>Aconitum lycoctonum subsp.</p>
<p>penninum, commonly known as the Alpine monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, which are typical of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>The plant produces dark brown, ribbed seeds within a spiny follicle, and its leaves are palmately compound with deeply lobed segments. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care.</p>
