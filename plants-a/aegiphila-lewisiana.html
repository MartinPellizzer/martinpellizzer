                <h1>Aegiphila lewisiana</h1>
<p>Aegiphila lewisiana, commonly known as Lewis's aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila lewisiana has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows upright with a bushy habit. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, rocky soils in which the plant typically grows.</p>
