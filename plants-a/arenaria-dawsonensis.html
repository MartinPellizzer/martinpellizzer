<p>Arenaria dawsonensis, commonly known as Dawson's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
