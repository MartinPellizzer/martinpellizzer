<p>Atriplex stipitata subsp.</p>
<p>miscella, commonly known as sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its succulent, often gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it a common component of saline soils and coastal areas.</p>
<p>The stems and leaves are often used in traditional medicine by Indigenous peoples for their purported healing properties.</p>
