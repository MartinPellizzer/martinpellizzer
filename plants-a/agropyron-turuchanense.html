                    <h1>Agropyron turuchanense</h1>
<p>Agropyron turuchanense, commonly known as the Turuchan wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, blue-green leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its rhizomatous growth system allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Agropyron turuchanense plays a vital role in the ecological dynamics of its native ecosystems.</p>
