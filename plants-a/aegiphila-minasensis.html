                <h1>Aegiphila minasensis</h1>
<p>Aegiphila minasensis, commonly known as the Minasensis Aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of purple or pink flowers. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its family.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila minasensis has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and vary in size from 2 to 8 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and covered with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly rough with age. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white in color, with tubular structures and five lobed petals, blooming during the spring and early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
