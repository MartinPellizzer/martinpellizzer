                <h1>Acilepis virgata</h1>
<p>Acilepis virgata, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are usually pentamerous, with five petals and sepals, and are often brightly colored.</p>
<p>Acilepis virgata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis virgata has leaves that are simple, elliptical in shape, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops fissures with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis virgata is primarily native to Laos and Thailand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. This plant typically grows in forested areas and is often associated with moist, shaded environments. It is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Laos and Thailand.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis virgata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in coastal areas. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found along the shoreline.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction have raised concerns for ecological management.</p>
