                <h1>Actinea bigelowii</h1>
<p>Actinea bigelowii, commonly known as the Bigelow's actinia, is a species of sea anemone found in the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Actiniidae and is characterized by its long, slender body and delicate, translucent tentacles. This marine organism typically inhabits rocky substrates in intertidal zones, where it can anchor itself using its pedal disc. Actinea bigelowii plays a role in the marine ecosystem by serving as both predator and prey.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it an interesting subject for marine biological study.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinea bigelowii has palmately compound leaves that are typically 10–20 cm in length, with 5–7 leaflets arranged radiating from a central point, and a dark green color with a slightly serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth, pale green surface that becomes slightly woody at the base. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in umbels, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a spherical, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea bigelowii is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically found in states such as Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. This species is commonly associated with maritime hammocks and scrub habitats. It is also found in parts of the Caribbean, including the Bahamas and Cuba.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea bigelowii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was primarily spread through human activity, such as gardening and landscaping efforts. This plant is now commonly found in moist, shaded areas along stream banks and in forest understories. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered a non-native species in many parts of its range.</p>
