                <h1>Acer tataricum var. laciniatum</h1>
<p>Acer tataricum var. laciniatum, commonly known as the Tatarian maple or dissected maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely dissected, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage makes it a striking addition to landscapes, though it is relatively slow-growing and may require support as it matures.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum var. laciniatum has compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a palmate shape and a bright green color during the growing season, turning orange-red in autumn.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is slender and has a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes furrowed with age. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, with separate male and female flowers, and is wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod that disperses by wind, and the roots are shallow and fibrous, adapting to moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This variety is known for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum var. laciniatum is a variant of the Tatarian maple, native to regions of East Asia, including parts of China, Korea, and Russia.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in its native range, its current distribution is limited and primarily restricted to specific areas in China. It thrives in moist, temperate climates, often found in forests or along riverbanks. This species typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum var. laciniatum is a striking ornamental tree known for its delicate, lace-like foliage that turns vibrant red in the fall.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. This species grows best in USDA hardiness zones 3-7, entering a dormant state in winter and budding in spring.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, and benefits from a balanced fertilizer in early spring. Regular pruning helps maintain its shape, while pests like aphids and diseases such as powdery mildew may require treatment.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials like heather or sedum can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer tataricum var. laciniatum is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health. It acts as a companion plant in woodland areas, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants through improved soil conditions. The plant also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
