                    <h1>Agialid glomerata</h1>
<p>Agialid glomerata, commonly known as the clustered marsh grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils, it is an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
