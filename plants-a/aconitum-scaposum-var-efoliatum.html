                    <h1>Aconitum scaposum var. efoliatum</h1>
<p>Aconitum scaposum var. efoliatum, commonly known as the Alpine monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to purple hooded flowers that resemble a monk's habit, which is a distinctive feature of the genus Aconitum. The plant has dark green, doubly pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
