                    <h1>Aotus tietkensii</h1>
<p>Aotus tietkensii, commonly known as the Tietkens' owl monkey, is a species of New World primate native to the rainforests of northern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, round eyes and a distinctive, long, slender body with a bushy tail. This arboreal species primarily inhabits the canopy layers of humid tropical forests, where it moves through the trees using its strong limbs and prehensile tail. The plant aspects of Aotus tietkensii are not directly relevant, as it is an animal, not a plant.</p>
<p>Therefore, there are no botanical features to describe.</p>
