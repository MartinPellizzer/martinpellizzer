                <h1>Adina metcalfii</h1>
<p>Adina metcalfii, commonly known as the California rosewood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Southern California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Adina metcalfii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adina metcalfii has alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are glossy green on top and lighter underneath, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, often branching, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by wind. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the dry, rocky environments where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina metcalfii is primarily native to China Southeast, Hainan, and Thailand.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil. Adina metcalfii is often seen in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the unique ecological conditions of Southeast Asia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adina metcalfii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, open woodlands, and along stream banks. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Its introduction has led to its establishment in native habitats, sometimes competing with native flora.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive potential, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits.</p>
