                        <h1>Acacia ferox</h1>
<p>Acacia ferox, commonly known as the black wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black, bark and compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. Acacia ferox is adapted to dry environments and is often found in coastal and inland regions.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in local ecosystems and has been used by Indigenous Australians for various purposes.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia ferox is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in savannas, grasslands, and rocky outcrops across these regions. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in sandy or well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Acacia ferox is also known for its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia ferox was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought and harsh environmental conditions. However, its introduction has sometimes led to the displacement of native vegetation in certain regions.</p>
<p>Despite its ecological benefits, careful management is required to prevent it from becoming invasive.</p>
