                <h1>Aconitum salisburifolium</h1>
<p>Aconitum salisburifolium, commonly known as Salisburifolium monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple spurred flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive and elegant appearance. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and kept away from livestock and children.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum salisburifolium has large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, hairy, and has a rough, grayish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, bell-shaped, and clustered in racemes, blooming in late summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, adapted for absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum salisburifolium is primarily native to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and central highlands. It thrives in cool, moist environments at higher altitudes. The species is adapted to the rugged terrain and diverse ecosystems of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum salisburifolium was mainly introduced to enhance the biodiversity and aesthetic value of alpine meadows in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. This plant is often cultivated in gardens and public parks for its striking blue or purple flowers. Its introduction has also been used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
