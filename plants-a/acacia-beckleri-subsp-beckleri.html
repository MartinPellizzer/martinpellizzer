Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses a group of vascular plants that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their primitive features.</p>
<p>Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that typically have showy flowers and are often found in tropical and temperate regions. Its order is Fabales, which includes plants with flowers that have a distinctive structure, such as those in the legume family. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, characterized by their pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive, often thorny appearance and nitrogen-fixing capabilities.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia beckleri, a specific type of acacia known for its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
