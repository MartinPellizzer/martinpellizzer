                <h1>Acroptilon subdentatum</h1>
<p>Acroptilon subdentatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved crownvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, compound leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil enrichment.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acroptilon subdentatum has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green color and finely serrated margins.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, herbaceous, and has a smooth, pale greenish-brown texture, growing in a branching pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, and the seeds are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroptilon subdentatum is primarily native to central and eastern North America, including the United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open habitats such as prairies, meadows, and disturbed areas. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with dry to moderately moist environments. It is particularly common in the Great Plains region and the eastern United States.</p>
<p>Acroptilon subdentatum is a perennial herb that plays an important role in its native ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acroptilon subdentatum was mainly introduced to the western United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant is considered an invasive species in some areas because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It spreads primarily through seeds dispersed by wind, water, and animals.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it poses a threat to native plant communities and ecosystem stability.</p>
