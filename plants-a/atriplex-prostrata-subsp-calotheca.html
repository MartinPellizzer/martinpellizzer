<p>Atriplex prostrata subsp.</p>
<p>calotheca, commonly known as coast sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in compact clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to saline and arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize coastal dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
