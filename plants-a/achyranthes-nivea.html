                <h1>Achyranthes nivea</h1>
<p>Achyranthes nivea, commonly known as white knotweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyranthes nivea has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually green on top and lighter on the underside, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stems are cylindrical, slightly hairy, and have a light green to brownish bark that becomes more rugged with age. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in spikes, blooming in the spring, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the seeds are tiny and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in moist soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes nivea is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant is also present in parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands, where it has adapted to similar environmental conditions. It plays an important ecological role in these regions by supporting local biodiversity and stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other parts of the world in some horticultural and agricultural contexts.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyranthes nivea was mainly introduced to disturbed areas such as roadsides, waste lands, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with poor soil conditions and full sun exposure. The plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it can spread rapidly due to its prolific seed production. It is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded due to human activities and climate change.</p>
