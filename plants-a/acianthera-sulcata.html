                <h1>Acianthera sulcata</h1>
<p>Acianthera sulcata, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, zigzag-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as rainforests. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Acianthera sulcata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated by orchid enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera sulcata has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, and a dark green coloration.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a light green to reddish-brown color, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, with a pale greenish-white color, featuring three petals and three sepals, and they bloom during the spring season; the pollination method is primarily through wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist environments for nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera sulcata is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the southeastern region of Brazil, particularly in the states of SÃ£o Paulo and Minas Gerais. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded forest understories. The plant is commonly associated with humid environments and is part of the rich biodiversity of the Atlantic Forest ecosystem.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to this specific geographic area within Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera sulcata was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It has established populations in regions with suitable tropical and subtropical climates. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in disturbed areas or near human settlements. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native flora in invaded regions.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is now considered an invasive species in several areas where it has been introduced.</p>
