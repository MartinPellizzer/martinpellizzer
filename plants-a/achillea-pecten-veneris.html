                <h1>Achillea pecten-veneris</h1>
<p>Achillea pecten-veneris, commonly known as Venus' comb, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant is known for its finely divided, fern-like leaves and its showy, yellow or orange flower heads that resemble a comb, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine and as a decorative plant adds to its botanical significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pecten-veneris has basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color, arranged in a rosette, and covered with fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and smooth, with a pale green color, growing from the base to form a flowering stalk. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pecten-veneris is primarily native to southern Europe, particularly the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, and parts of southern France. This plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often associated with coastal or limestone areas. It is also known to grow in open woodlands and dry meadows.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into North Africa, including countries like Morocco and Algeria.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pecten-veneris was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, daisy-like flowers.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas, particularly in the western regions of the country. Although it is non-native, it has been reported in several states, including California, Oregon, and Washington. Its spread is often associated with human activity, such as seed dispersal through garden waste or landscaping practices.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered a major invasive species in these regions.</p>
