<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pecten-veneris has basal leaves that are lanceolate, with a bluish-gray color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes more fibrous with age. The flowers are yellow and form dense, flat-topped clusters called capitula, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene enclosed in a pappus of bristles, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pecten-veneris is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly found in regions such as Spain, Portugal, and parts of southern France.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that includes some introduced populations in North America, primarily in the United States and Canada. This species thrives in dry, rocky, or gravelly soils, often in open habitats like scrublands and woodland edges. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>The conservation status of Achillea pecten-veneris is generally stable, though some local populations may be threatened by habitat loss and overgrazing.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea pecten-veneris is a hardy perennial plant known for its feathery, yellow flowers and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing the roots in early spring or autumn. The plant has a growth cycle that involves active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring helps promote healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering maintains its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if conditions are too wet.</p>
