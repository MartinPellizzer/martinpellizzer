                    <h1>Alnus mirbelii var. acutissima</h1>
<p>Alnus mirbelii var. acutissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are sharply pointed, giving it its specific epithet *acutissima*. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>The tree is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with bacteria in its root system.</p>
