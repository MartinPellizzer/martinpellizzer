<p>Angelica edulis f. triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed edible angelica, is a variant of the angelica plant characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces tall, flowering stems with small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are edible and have a strong, aromatic flavor, often used in traditional medicine and cooking.</p>
<p>However, due to its potent compounds, it should be handled with care and consumed in moderation.</p>
