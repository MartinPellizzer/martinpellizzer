<p>Athamanta corctata, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in steep, rocky terrain.</p>
<p>Athamanta corctata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
