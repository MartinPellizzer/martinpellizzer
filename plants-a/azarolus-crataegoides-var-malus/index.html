<p>Common hawthorn, scientifically known as Azarolus crataegoides var. malus, is a small deciduous tree native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small red berries in the fall, which are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Common hawthorn is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in woodland areas and along riverbanks.</p>
