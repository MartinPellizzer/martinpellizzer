                    <h1>Aloe millotii</h1>
<p>Aloe millotii, commonly known as the mountain aloe, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow-orange flowers, which bloom during the warmer months. Aloe millotii is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and resilience make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and medicinal use.</p>
