                <h1>Actinocephalus glareosus</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus glareosus, commonly known as the shining starflower, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, star-shaped flowers that are typically bright yellow or orange. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus glareosus has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale green to brown color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus glareosus is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, specifically South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the fynbos biome, which is characterized by its unique vegetation and biodiversity. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline and is often associated with maritime climates. It is adapted to the harsh conditions of the coastal environment, including strong winds and salt spray.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus glareosus was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts.</p>
<p>It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its showy, yellow flowers and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on biodiversity.</p>
