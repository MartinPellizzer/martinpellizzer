                    <h1>Agave newberyi</h1>
<p>Agave newberyi, commonly known as the Newberyâ€™s agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Agave newberyi is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
