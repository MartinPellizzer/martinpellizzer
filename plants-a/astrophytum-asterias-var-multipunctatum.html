<p>Astrophytum asterias var. multipunctatum, commonly known as the star cactus or moon cactus, is a unique species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spherical shape and distinctive star-like patterns on its surface, which are formed by the arrangement of its areoles and spines. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable environments.</p>
