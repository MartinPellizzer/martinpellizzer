                <h1>Actinella tweediei</h1>
<p>Actinella tweediei, commonly known as the Tweedie's actinella, is a rare and delicate fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its small, clustered spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinella tweediei has small, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a rough, bark-like texture that ranges in color from gray to brown. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, usually white or pale green, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, helping it to anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella tweediei is primarily native to the Pacific Northwest region of North America, including parts of Washington, Oregon, and northern California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist to wet habitats such as stream banks, forest floors, and rocky areas. This plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is often associated with coniferous and mixed forests.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into parts of British Columbia and Alaska as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinella tweediei was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as a horticultural plant due to its ornamental value. However, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, which contributes to its spread.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its distribution and minimize its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
