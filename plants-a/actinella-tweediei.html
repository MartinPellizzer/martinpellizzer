<p>Actinella tweediei, commonly known as the Tweedie's actinella, is a rare and delicate fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its small, clustered spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
