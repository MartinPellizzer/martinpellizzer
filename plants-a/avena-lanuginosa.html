                    <h1>Avena lanuginosa</h1>
<p>Avena lanuginosa, commonly known as the soft oat or velvet oat, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs covering its stems and leaves, which give it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Avena lanuginosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has also been used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
