                <h1>Achillea firma</h1>
<p>Achillea firma, commonly known as narrowleaf yarrow, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves and flat-topped clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and has historical uses in herbal medicine.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance makes it a suitable choice for xeriscaping and low-maintenance landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea firma has basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture and a slightly hairy surface, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, covered in a fine, white pubescence, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age. Its flowers are flat-topped clusters (compound umbels) composed of small, white to pale yellow ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea firma is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of Russia.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other areas, including parts of Europe and North America, often as an ornamental species. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is commonly found in alpine meadows and grasslands. This plant typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted native habitat and limited cultivation, Achillea firma is considered to be of conservation concern in its natural range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea firma is a hardy perennial plant known for its vibrant yellow flowers and drought-resistant nature.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seeds sown in late summer. The growth cycle of Achillea firma includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in late spring to early summer.</p>
