                <h1>Achillea firma</h1>
<p>Achillea firma, commonly known as narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces flat-topped clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its historical use in traditional medicine is attributed to its aromatic compounds and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea firma has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a silver-gray underside and a darker green top, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, somewhat hairy, and have a reddish-brown color, growing in a clumping manner. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk florets surrounded by white ray florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea firma is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited, with populations primarily restricted to isolated areas in Spain and Italy. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in grasslands and open woodlands. This species typically grows at elevations between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Achillea firma is considered a vulnerable species and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea firma is a hardy perennial plant known for its ornamental foliage and long-lasting flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. The growth cycle of Achillea firma begins with new growth in spring, followed by flowering in mid to late summer, and it goes dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
