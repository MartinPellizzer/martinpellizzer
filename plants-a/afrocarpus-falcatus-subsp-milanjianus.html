<p>Afrocarpus falcatus subsp.</p>
<p>milanjianus, commonly known as the Milanjianus yellowwood, is a rare and endemic species native to the eastern coastal forests of South Africa. It is a large evergreen tree characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and lanceolate, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by woody, cone-like structures that contain edible seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in humid, shaded environments within its restricted range.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
