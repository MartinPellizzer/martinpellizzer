                        <h1>Acacia scabra</h1>
<p>Acacia scabra, commonly known as the rough acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow or orange globular flowers, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Acacia scabra is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Its wood and bark have been traditionally used for various purposes, including fuel and medicinal applications.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Acacia scabra belongs to the kingdom Plantae.</p>
<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and their allies, known for their primitive features and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a large group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species.</p>
<p>Its order is Fabales, which consists of plants with flowers that typically have two sets of petals and are often legumes. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, characterized by pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive, often thorny appearance and nitrogen-fixing capabilities.</p>
<p>Its species is Acacia scabra, a specific type of acacia known for its slender, wiry stems and small, greenish flowers, typically found in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia scabra is primarily native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the state, particularly in the southern and central parts. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in shrublands and open woodlands. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of the region, with its small, waxy leaves helping to conserve water.</p>
<p>Acacia scabra plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various native animals.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia scabra was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, thriving in sandy or well-drained soils. The plant is known for its ability to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in some ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its hardiness, it is not considered a major threat to native vegetation in most areas.</p>
