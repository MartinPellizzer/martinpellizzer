<p>Aster bellis, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant with small, delicate leaves and clusters of tiny, daisy-like flowers.</p>
<p>It typically blooms in early spring and is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows, roadsides, and gardens. The plant has a creeping growth habit, with hairy stems that help it retain moisture. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, and they attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Aster bellis is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it has been introduced to many other regions around the world.</p>
