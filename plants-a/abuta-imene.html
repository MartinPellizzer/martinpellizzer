<p>Abuta imene, commonly known as the African butterbean, is a climbing shrub native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits. The plant is notable for its yellow flowers and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a resilient plant in diverse environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abuta imene has leaves that are alternate, ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from May to July, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
