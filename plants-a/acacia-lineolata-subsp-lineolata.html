                <h1>Acacia lineolata subsp. lineolata</h1>
<p>Acacia lineolata subsp.</p>
<p>lineolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, linear leaflets.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow globular flower heads, which are typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia lineolata subsp.</p>
<p>lineolata has compound leaves that are bipinnate, with small, linear leaflets arranged in a feathery pattern, typically green in color and measuring up to 15 cm in length. The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, pale grey bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures.</p>
<p>Its flowers are clustered in cylindrical spikes, featuring yellow to orange flowers that bloom during the cooler months, primarily pollinated by birds and insects. The fruit is a flat, woody pod that splits open to release small, ellipsoid seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia lineolata subsp.</p>
<p>lineolata is a shrub native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa, where it occurs in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. Its current distribution includes parts of Namibia and into eastern regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils. This subspecies typically grows at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>It is listed as a species of concern due to habitat loss and fragmentation, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia lineolata subsp.</p>
<p>lineolata is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub native to southern Africa, known for its attractive foliage and yellow flowers. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period for optimal germination.</p>
<p>The plant has a slow growth cycle, often reaching maturity within 5 to 7 years, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering. Fertilization should be minimal, applied in early spring, while pruning is best done after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with succulents or Mediterranean herbs can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>
