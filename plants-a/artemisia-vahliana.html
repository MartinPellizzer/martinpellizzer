                    <h1>Artemisia vahliana</h1>
<p>Artemisia vahliana, commonly known as sand artemisia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Artemisia vahliana is often used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in ecological restoration projects.</p>
