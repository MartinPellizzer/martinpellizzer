                <h1>Adenanthos procumbens</h1>
<p>Adenanthos procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate adenanthos, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. The plant has aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and sandy environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in native gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthos procumbens has small, ovate leaves that are usually arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is low-growing, sprawling, and covered with a rough, greyish bark, growing close to the ground. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences, blooming from late autumn to early spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos procumbens is primarily native to southeastern Australia, specifically the states of New South Wales and Victoria.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with coastal and inland regions. It is known for its low-growing habit and distinctive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Adenanthos procumbens is an important part of the local flora and is often found in conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthos procumbens was mainly introduced to the eastern regions of Australia, particularly in New South Wales and the ACT.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along coastal areas and in open woodlands. This plant has been introduced to various conservation areas and botanical gardens for its ornamental value. It is often cultivated for its attractive, clustered flowers that range from pink to red.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
