<p>Atriplex rosea subsp.</p>
<p>foliolosa, commonly known as the leafy saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, trifoliate leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in desert scrub and washland habitats.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its native range.</p>
