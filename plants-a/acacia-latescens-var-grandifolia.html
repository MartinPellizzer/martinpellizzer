                    <h1>Acacia latescens var. grandifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia latescens var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, glandular leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces yellow, globular inflorescences that bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or through animal activity.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited to harsh environments due to its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen through its root nodules.</p>
