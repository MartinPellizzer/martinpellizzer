                    <h1>Allium gulczense</h1>
<p>Allium gulczense, commonly known as the Polish garlic, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Allium genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bulbous structure, which is typically smaller than that of common garlic varieties. The plant produces slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. It is native to Central and Eastern Europe, particularly Poland, where it grows in moist, temperate habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Allium gulczense is considered a botanically interesting but endangered species.</p>
