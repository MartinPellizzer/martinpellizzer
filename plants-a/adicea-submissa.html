                <h1>Adicea submissa</h1>
<p>Adicea submissa, commonly known as the soft-stemmed adicea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Adicea submissa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea submissa has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a pale green color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are simple, with five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea submissa is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas with moist, well-drained soils. This species thrives in coastal environments and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems. It is also present in some regions of Central America and northern South America.</p>
<p>Adicea submissa is an important plant in local biodiversity and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea submissa was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental dispersal.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions across Europe, particularly in southern countries with Mediterranean climates. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides and in urban green spaces. Its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native flora in certain areas.</p>
<p>Despite its introduction, it is not yet classified as an invasive species in most regions.</p>
