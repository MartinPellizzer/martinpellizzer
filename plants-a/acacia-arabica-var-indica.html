                    <h1>Acacia arabica var. indica</h1>
<p>Acacia arabica var. indica, commonly known as the Indian acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often thorned stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flower clusters that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in hard, woody pods, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of tannins.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its hardy nature in arid environments.</p>
