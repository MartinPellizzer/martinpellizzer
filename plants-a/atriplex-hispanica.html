<p>Atriplex hispanica, commonly known as Spanish saltbush, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, green to grayish-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a hardy species in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Atriplex hispanica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate drought.</p>
