<p>Adiantum capillus, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and prefers well-draining soil. Adiantum capillus has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly over time.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for both ornamental and ecological garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum capillus has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem, and have a light green color.

<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This fern thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is particularly abundant in the southeastern United States, especially in states like Georgia, Tennessee, and North Carolina.</p>
<p>Adiantum capillus is often seen growing along the edges of forests and in rocky outcrops.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum capillus was mainly introduced to North America and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along streams. This fern is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value. It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native habitat.</p>
