                <h1>Acmanthera parviflora</h1>
<p>Acmanthera parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered acmanthera, is a species of flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and related plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open grasslands or scrublands.</p>
<p>Acmanthera parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional medicinal uses in its native region.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acmanthera parviflora has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>Its stem is slender, slightly woody, and covered in a rough, grayish bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the soil in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmanthera parviflora is primarily native to Brazil North.</p>
<p>It is found in the northern regions of Brazil, particularly in the Amazonian rainforest and surrounding areas. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with high rainfall. It is commonly found in forest understories and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the unique ecological conditions of the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acmanthera parviflora was mainly introduced to regions with warm, temperate climates and well-drained soils, where it can thrive in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and abandoned lots. This plant is often spread through seeds dispersed by wind, water, or human activity. Due to its adaptability, it has become naturalized in several parts of the world outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
