                <h1>Acronychia goniocarpa</h1>
<p>Acronychia goniocarpa, commonly known as the broad-leafed acronychia, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and elliptical to ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal or lowland areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia goniocarpa has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grey to brown in color, and it grows as a small tree or shrub. Its flowers are small and clustered, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia goniocarpa is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in the eastern and western regions. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within the understorey of dense forests. It is commonly associated with coastal and lowland areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within New Guinea, making it a regionally significant species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia goniocarpa was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high sunlight exposure and moderate to high rainfall. The plant is often found in coastal areas or near riverbanks where the soil remains consistently moist. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native habitats.</p>
