<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow or white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Astragalus lasius is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
