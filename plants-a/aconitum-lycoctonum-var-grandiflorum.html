                    <h1>Aconitum lycoctonum var. grandiflorum</h1>
<p>Aconitum lycoctonum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the giant monkshood, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces large, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental value in gardens but is toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids.</p>
