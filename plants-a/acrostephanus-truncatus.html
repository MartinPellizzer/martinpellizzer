                <h1>Acrostephanus truncatus</h1>
<p>Acrostephanus truncatus, commonly known as the African daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Acrostephanus truncatus is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostephanus truncatus has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and slightly woody, with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively unbranched. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostephanus truncatus is primarily native to the Mediterranean Basin, including regions such as southern Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky or sandy soils along coastal areas and in dry, open habitats. This plant thrives in temperate climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. It is often associated with maritime climates and can be found in areas with limited moisture.</p>
<p>Its native range extends to parts of southern France, Italy, Spain, and the coastal regions of North Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostephanus truncatus was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban areas where it can thrive in nutrient-rich conditions. This plant has shown adaptability to various climates, allowing it to spread beyond its native range. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered highly invasive in most regions where it has been introduced.</p>
