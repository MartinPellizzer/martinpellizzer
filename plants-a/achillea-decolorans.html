                <h1>Achillea decolorans</h1>
<p>Achillea decolorans, commonly known as the variable yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and its tall, branched stems that bear clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing a showy display that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The species is known for its variability in flower color and leaf structure, which can vary depending on environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea decolorans has compound, serrated leaves that are basal and alternate, with a gray-green color and a rough texture, typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a reddish-brown color, growing in a clumping pattern. The flowers are flat-topped clusters (corymbs) composed of small, white to pale yellow ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a cylindrical achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea decolorans is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean area, including parts of Italy, Spain, and France.</p>
<p>It is now also found in some regions of North Africa and the Middle East, though its current distribution is limited. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes, grasslands, and woodland edges. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Achillea decolorans is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea decolorans is a perennial flowering plant known for its showy, daisy-like blooms and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, division, or stem cuttings, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring minimal watering once established.</p>
<p>Fertilization should be light in early spring, and regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote new growth. While generally resistant to pests and diseases, it may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper spacing and organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or echinacea can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea decolorans is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including insects and birds, contributing to biodiversity in its habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other herbs and flowers to enhance garden ecosystems. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing land.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers habitat and shelter for small insects and ground-dwelling animals.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea decolorans is a flowering plant known for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its attractive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, some traditional practices may incorporate its parts into local remedies. In medicinal contexts, it has been studied for potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, though more research is needed. Industrially, it contributes to biodiversity and supports pollinators, enhancing ecological balance.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and endurance, often featured in folklore and traditional art.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Achillea decolorans has several popular cultivars such as 'Lavender Glow' and 'Pink Frost,' which are prized for their showy, long-lasting flowers and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>Hybrids of Achillea decolorans are often created to enhance color variation, bloom duration, and disease resistance, making them more adaptable to different garden conditions. These cultivars and hybrids are widely used in horticulture for their ornamental value in borders, rock gardens, and cottage gardens. Their ability to thrive in full sun and well-drained soil contributes to their popularity among gardeners.</p>
<p>Overall, Achillea decolorans plays an important role in modern horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of cultivation.</p>
