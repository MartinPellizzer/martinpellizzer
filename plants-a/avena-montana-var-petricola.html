                    <h1>Avena montana var. petricola</h1>
<p>Avena montana var. petricola, commonly known as the rock oat, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafless stems that often grow in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to harsh, alpine environments due to its low water requirements and cold tolerance.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in difficult terrain.</p>
