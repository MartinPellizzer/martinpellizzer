                <h1>Actinodaphne quercina</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne quercina, commonly known as the Burmese camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth surface and a fragrant aroma when crushed.</p>
<p>Actinodaphne quercina is valued for its timber and has traditional uses in medicine and perfumery.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne quercina has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside, measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and cylindrical, with a rough, dark brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it grows as a small to medium-sized tree. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in spikes, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, globose drupe that turns red when mature, dispersing its seeds through animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne quercina is primarily native to Java.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of this island, which is part of Indonesia. The plant thrives in humid and warm climates, typically in lowland forests. It is commonly encountered in areas with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the western and central parts of Java.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne quercina was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where its ornamental and medicinal properties are valued.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils, such as parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of the Americas. The plant's introduction has been driven by horticultural interests and traditional medicine practices. Due to its adaptability, it has become naturalized in several non-native locations.</p>
<p>However, its spread is generally limited by environmental conditions and human management.</p>
