                <h1>Actinodaphne quercina</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne quercina, commonly known as the Burmese ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant typically grows in lowland tropical forests and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a glossy surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in catkins.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, woody drupe that contains a single seed.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne quercina has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout the plant's growth. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in panicles, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne quercina is a tropical evergreen tree native to the western Pacific, primarily found in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Indonesia and Malaysia, where it thrives in lowland and hill forests. This species prefers humid environments with high rainfall and well-drained soils. It typically grows at altitudes between 200 and 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, Actinodaphne quercina is listed as endangered by the IUCN, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne quercina is a tropical evergreen shrub known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seed, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. The plant has a slow to moderate growth cycle, typically thriving in warm, humid climates with indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>For optimal growth, it requires well-draining soil and consistent watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season and regular pruning to shape the plant and encourage bushier growth are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but can be affected by scale insects or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with other tropical plants like ferns or orchids can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a shaded garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne quercina is a valuable plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and birds, which play a crucial role in its reproductive cycle. The plant also acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other native flora in the ecosystem. Additionally, its dense root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Overall, Actinodaphne quercina contributes significantly to ecological balance by offering multiple benefits to both the environment and the species that depend on it.</p>
