                <h1>Achillea dubia</h1>
<p>Achillea dubia, commonly known as the alpine yarrow, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, flat-topped flower heads that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to alpine environments. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a grayish-white coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Achillea dubia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize slopes in erosion-prone areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea dubia has leaves that are lance-shaped, with a silver-gray underside and a darker green upper surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and have a grayish-green color, growing in a clumping pattern. The flowers are yellow, forming flat-topped clusters known as composite heads, and bloom from late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea dubia is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly found in countries such as Spain, Portugal, and southern France.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends to parts of North Africa and the Canary Islands. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky soils and open grasslands. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Achillea dubia is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, indicating it is not currently facing significant threats to its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea dubia is a hardy perennial plant known for its aromatic foliage and delicate yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, division, or cuttings, with division being the most reliable method for maintaining genetic consistency. This plant has a biennial growth cycle, typically blooming in its second year before going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, avoiding over-saturation to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. Common pests include aphids and spider mites, while fungal diseases can occur in overly wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like rosemary or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea dubia is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen, supporting a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts beneficial insects and wildlife, contributing to biodiversity in its habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other wildflowers to enhance ecosystem resilience. Its deep roots help with erosion control by stabilizing soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea dubia offers ecological benefits by improving soil structure and supporting a range of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea dubia is a flowering plant known for its various uses and applications across different domains.</p>
<p>In medicinal contexts, it has been traditionally used to treat ailments such as skin conditions and digestive issues due to its anti-inflammatory properties.
