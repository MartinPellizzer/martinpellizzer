                    <h1>Achillea dubia</h1>
<p>Achillea dubia, commonly known as the alpine yarrow, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, flat-topped flower heads that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to alpine environments. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a grayish-white coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Achillea dubia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize slopes in erosion-prone areas.</p>
