                <h1>Abutilon longicuspe var. epilosum</h1>
<p>Abutilon longicuspe var. epilosum, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a variant of the abutilon genus native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its fuzzy, velvety leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon longicuspe var. epilosum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth texture and a dark green upper surface, and a lighter green underside; they are alternate in arrangement and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly woody with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are showy, with five lobes, and are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming during the summer months; they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon longicuspe var. epilosum is a rare plant native to the eastern Andes of Colombia and Ecuador.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated locations within its native range. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and humid mountain valleys. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon longicuspe var. epilosum is a unique and ornamental plant known for its fuzzy, heart-shaped leaves and showy flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant has a warm-season growth cycle, thriving in spring and summer, and entering dormancy in colder months.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to encourage bushiness are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
