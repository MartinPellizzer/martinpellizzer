It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon longicuspe var. epilosum is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans the eastern coast of Brazil. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within the understory of dense tropical rainforests. It is commonly associated with areas that have high rainfall and fertile, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon longicuspe var. epilosum was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, gravelly soils, and sandy beaches. This plant thrives in sunny, well-drained environments and is often associated with maritime climates. Its introduction has led to its establishment in native plant communities, sometimes competing with local flora.</p>
<p>It is considered a non-native invasive species in some areas, requiring management to prevent its spread.</p>
