                <h1>Adiantum tetraphyllum</h1>
<p>Adiantum tetraphyllum, commonly known as the four-leafed maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Adiantum tetraphyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum tetraphyllum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, arranged in a compact rosette pattern, and typically measure up to 30 cm in length, displaying a fresh green color.</p>
<p>The stem is short and creeping, with a smooth, light green to brownish bark that grows close to the ground. It does not produce flowers; instead, it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and anchor itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Adiantum tetraphyllum is a non-flowering plant, so it lacks flowers, fruit, and seeds.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum tetraphyllum is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil North, Brazil Northeast, Brazil South, Brazil Southeast, Brazil West-Central, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Galápagos, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Jamaica, Leeward Is., Mexico Central, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Southeast, Mexico Southwest, Nicaragua, Panamá, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, Suriname, Trinidad-Tobago, Venezuela, Venezuelan Antilles, and Windward Is.</p>
<p>This fern is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. It thrives in humid climates and is often associated with forest understories. The plant is well-adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, nutrient-rich substrates.</p>
<p>Its wide native range spans across much of Central and South America, as well as parts of the Caribbean.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum tetraphyllum was mainly introduced to wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes where it thrives in moist, shady environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed areas such as ditches, stream banks, and forest clearings. This fern is commonly spread through its spores, which can be carried by wind or water. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution has expanded in parts of North America and Europe, often colonizing new areas where conditions are favorable.</p>
