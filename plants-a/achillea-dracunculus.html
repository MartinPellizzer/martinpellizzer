                <h1>Achillea dracunculus</h1>
<p>Achillea dracunculus, commonly known as lesser yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm and features finely divided, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its aromatic foliage and historical use in traditional medicine highlight its botanical and cultural significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea dracunculus has basal, lance-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hollow, and has a reddish-brown color, growing in a clumping pattern. Its flowers are yellow, composed of ray florets surrounding a central disk, and bloom from June to August, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea dracunculus is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees, Alps, and Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Central and Eastern Europe, though it is less common today due to habitat loss and changes in land use. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>It is considered a conservation concern in some areas due to habitat fragmentation and overgrazing, but it is not currently listed as endangered at the global level.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea dracunculus is a hardy perennial plant known for its feathery foliage and vibrant yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seeds sown in late summer. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in early spring and blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune spent flowers to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with aromatic herbs like thyme or rosemary can help repel pests and enhance growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea dracunculus is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a wide range of wildlife, including beneficial insects and birds, contributing to biodiversity in its habitat. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other herbaceous species to enhance soil health and deter pests. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by supporting a diverse food web and promoting a healthy ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
