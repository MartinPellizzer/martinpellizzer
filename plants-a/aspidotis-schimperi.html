<p>Aspidotis schimperi, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting various pollinators. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Aspidotis schimperi is often found in disturbed habitats and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions.</p>
