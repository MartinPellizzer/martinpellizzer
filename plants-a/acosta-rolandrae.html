<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky slopes. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture.</p>
<p>Acosta rolandrae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta rolandrae has alternate, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a slightly serrated edge, and they are arranged along the stem in a spiral pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern.

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta rolandrae is primarily native to the arid regions of northwestern Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the provinces of San Juan and San Luis. This plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in dry, sun-exposed areas. It is adapted to the harsh climate of the region, with features that help it conserve water.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta rolandrae was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread throughout the country. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. It is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
