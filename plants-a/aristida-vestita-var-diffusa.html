                    <h1>Aristida vestita var. diffusa</h1>
<p>Aristida vestita var. diffusa, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes.</p>
