                            <h1>Achillea Odorata Subsp. Paucidentata</h1>
<p>Achillea odorata subsp. paucidentata is a lesser-known member of the Asteraceae family known for its delicate, aromatic foliage and subtle floral display. Native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, this plant thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. Its unique subspecies designation highlights subtle differences in leaf structure and floral characteristics compared to its more common relatives. Often overlooked in horticultural literature, it offers a rare opportunity for gardeners to cultivate a plant with both ecological and aesthetic value. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
