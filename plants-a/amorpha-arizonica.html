<p>Amorpha arizonica, commonly known as Arizona burr medic, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, spiny pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Amorpha arizonica is adapted to drought conditions and is sometimes used for erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
