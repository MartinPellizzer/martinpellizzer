                <h1>Adiantum viscosum</h1>
<p>Adiantum viscosum, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, tree-like appearance with a central stem and overlapping, lobed fronds that resemble antlers, hence its common name. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption from the air and rain. Its fronds are covered in a fine, sticky substance that helps retain moisture and protect against pests.</p>
<p>Adiantum viscosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited for hanging baskets or mounting on bark.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum viscosum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, typically ranging from 10 to 30 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on top and lighter underneath, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows in a compact, clumping form.</p>
<p>It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>
