<p>Allosorus esculentus, commonly known as the edible bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic invertebrates for nourishment. The plant typically grows in shallow water and has finely divided leaves that aid in buoyancy. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually yellow or green, and it reproduces via seeds or vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Despite its carnivorous nature, it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations.</p>
