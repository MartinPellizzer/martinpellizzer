                    <h1>Aethusa fatua</h1>
<p>Aethusa fatua, commonly known as the deadly carrot, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers.</p>
<p>It is a biennial plant that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant contains toxic compounds, including apiol and limonene, which can cause severe gastrointestinal distress if ingested. Its root is not typically used in culinary applications due to its high toxicity, though it has been historically used in herbal medicine with caution.</p>
<p>The plant's rapid growth and invasive potential make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
