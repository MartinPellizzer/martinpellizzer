                    <h1>Apium petroselinum var. angustifolium</h1>
<p>Apium petroselinum var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved parsley, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are narrower and more elongated compared to common parsley. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are typically less developed than in other parsley varieties, and it is often grown for its aromatic foliage rather than its roots.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in culinary and medicinal applications for its fresh, parsley-like flavor.</p>
