                <h1>Actinea formosa</h1>
<p>Actinea formosa, commonly known as the golden starwort, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers are usually yellow or orange in color.</p>
<p>Actinea formosa is often found in clusters and is valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinea formosa has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with each leaflet being oval-shaped, smooth-edged, and ranging in size from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are a vibrant green on top and slightly lighter underneath, providing a striking visual contrast. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly rough with age. The plant produces small, white flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, while the roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea formosa is primarily native to the eastern United States, including states such as Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded woodlands and along the edges of streams and rivers. This species thrives in rich, organic soils and is often associated with mixed hardwood forests. It is an herbaceous perennial that produces showy, white to pink flowers in the spring.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare plant in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinea formosa was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been found in various regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and the United States. The plant's ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its rapid growth rate contribute to its successful establishment in these areas. It often competes with native species, potentially altering local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the importance of monitoring non-native plant species for ecological impacts.</p>
