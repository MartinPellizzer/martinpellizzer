                    <h1>Acriulus</h1>
<p>Acriulus, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in wet or marshy habitats across Europe, Asia, and Africa. They are characterized by their erect, leafy stems and showy, greenish-yellow to brownish flowers that bloom in late summer. Acriulus species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their ecological role and their use in traditional medicine.</p>
