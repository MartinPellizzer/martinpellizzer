                <h1>Adiantum boliviense</h1>
<p>Adiantum boliviense, commonly known as the Bolivian maidenhair fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates or soil.</p>
<p>Adiantum boliviense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum boliviense has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and they are typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green, with a smooth surface and can reach up to 30 cm in length. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a spreading pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds through wind dispersal, and the roots are fibrous and well-developed for anchoring and nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum boliviense is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions spanning Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid, tropical, and subtropical environments, often growing in shaded forest understories. This fern thrives in areas with high moisture levels and well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. It is typically associated with montane and lowland rainforests, where it contributes to the biodiversity of the understory vegetation.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of the Andes and adjacent lowland areas, where it plays a role in the ecological balance of these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum boliviense was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. This fern is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its delicate, lace-like fronds. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil.</p>
<p>While it is not native to the region, it has become established in certain wetland habitats.</p>
