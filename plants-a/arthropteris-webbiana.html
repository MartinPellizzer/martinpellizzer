<p>Arthropteris webbiana, commonly known as the webb's huperzia, is a species of clubmoss native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a distinctive, creeping rhizome with erect, linear leaves that are often covered in tiny, scale-like structures. Its sporophylls are clustered in dense, spore-producing structures called strobila, which are typically found at the base of the leaves.</p>
<p>Arthropteris webbiana plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms in its native ecosystem.</p>
