                <h1>Acrostichum fendleri</h1>
<p>Acrostichum fendleri, commonly known as the Mexican sword fern, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae).</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with erect, sword-shaped fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Acrostichum fendleri is native to Mexico and Central America, where it thrives in humid tropical and subtropical climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum fendleri has large, pinnately compound leaves that are broad and lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 1 to 3 meters in length, with a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and fibrous, with a rough, bark-like texture that is generally light gray to brown in color, and it grows in a clumping manner. The plant produces inconspicuous, small greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, blooming during the summer months, and are wind-pollinated. The fruits are small, three-lobed berries that mature to a red color, and the seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fruits.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in wetland habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum fendleri is primarily native to the Caribbean, Central America, and northern South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in coastal areas and mangrove swamps. This plant thrives in humid, saline environments and is often associated with estuaries and tidal zones. Its distribution includes countries such as Mexico, Cuba, and parts of Colombia.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum fendleri was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland areas, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. This plant is often associated with disturbed or flooded soils and can thrive in both freshwater and brackish environments. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various coastal and riparian habitats.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature.</p>
