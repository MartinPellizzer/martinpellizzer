                <h1>Acosta pannosa</h1>
<p>Acosta pannosa, commonly known as the woolly acosta, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely hairy, often grayish foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta pannosa has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta pannosa is primarily native to the Andean region of South America, particularly in countries such as Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and mountainous areas, often growing in rocky or well-drained soils. This plant is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of the Andes, where it thrives in regions with moderate rainfall. It is often associated with open habitats and can be found in both natural and semi-cultivated environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological niche, it is considered a characteristic species of the Andean flora.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta pannosa was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in shaded woodland areas and along stream banks. This plant has been reported in several states across the eastern United States. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>It is often spread through seed dispersal by water and animals.</p>
