<p>Aechmea bromeliifolia var. angustispica, commonly known as the narrow-spurred aechmea, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use.

This variety produces a tall flower spike with vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
