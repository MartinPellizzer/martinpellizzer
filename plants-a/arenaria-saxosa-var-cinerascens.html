                    <h1>Arenaria saxosa var. cinerascens</h1>
<p>Arenaria saxosa var. cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-gray sandpink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in arid regions.</p>
<p>It features small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically on slender stems. The leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, ash-gray coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it a suitable ground cover in xerophytic gardens.</p>
