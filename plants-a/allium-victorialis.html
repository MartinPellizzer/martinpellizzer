<p>Allium victorialis, commonly known as the purple onion, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous structure and tall, hollow stems. The plant produces clusters of small, purple or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette at the base.</p>
<p>Allium victorialis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in culinary applications, though its flavor is milder than that of the common onion.</p>
