<p>Achillea lobata, commonly known as yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and flat, composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually white to pale pink and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Achillea lobata is often used in herbal medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea lobata has basal, narrow, gray-green leaves that are lance-shaped, arranged in a rosette, and measure up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age. Its flower heads are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from June to August and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea lobata is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>While its native range is primarily in these areas, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including California and New Zealand.
