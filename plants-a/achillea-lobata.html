                <h1>Achillea lobata</h1>
<p>Achillea lobata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features slender, aromatic leaves with a serrated edge and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or open habitats.</p>
<p>Its common name is derived from the mythological figure Achilles, who was said to have used the plant for healing.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea lobata has compound, deeply lobed leaves that are gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture and a basal arrangement, typically ranging from 5 to 15 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat woody at the base, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age. The flowers are flat-topped clusters (compound umbels) of small, white to pale yellow ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, enabling the plant to spread vegetatively and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea lobata is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly California and Oregon.</p>
<p>While it was originally found in coastal and inland areas, its current distribution includes parts of Europe and Asia due to human introduction. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. This species typically grows at elevations between 0 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its limited natural range and habitat specificity make it a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea lobata is a hardy perennial plant known for its showy, yellow-orange flowers and fern-like foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. The plant has a dormant growth cycle, with new growth emerging in early spring and blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune spent flowers to encourage continuous blooming. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites.</p>
<p>Companion planting with echinacea or lavender can enhance its growth and attract beneficial pollinators.</p>
