Its leaves are usually simple and opposite, with a leathery texture, and it produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, contributing to its propagation in natural habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra griffithii has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, measuring approximately 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips, and it exhibits a bushy growth pattern.
