                    <h1>Alaticaulia cocapatae</h1>
<p>Alaticaulia cocapatae, commonly known as the Andean velvet tree, is a rare shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of its environment through specialized leaf structures and a short growing season. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Alaticaulia cocapatae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
