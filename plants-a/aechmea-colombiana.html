                <h1>Aechmea colombiana</h1>
<p>Aechmea colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes mountains of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant produces vibrant, spathiflorous inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, adding visual interest to its appearance. Its foliage is typically a deep green, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Aechmea colombiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance in suitable growing conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea colombiana has rosette-shaped leaves that are wide, fleshy, and dark green with a metallic sheen, arranged in a tight spiral around the central stem.</p>
<p>The stem is short and sturdy, with a smooth, pale green surface, and grows upright from the base of the leaf rosette. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by brightly colored bracts, typically in shades of red or orange, and it blooms during the dry season, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a capsule that produces small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and absorbing water and nutrients from the soil.</p>
