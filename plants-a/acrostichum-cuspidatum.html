                <h1>Acrostichum cuspidatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum cuspidatum, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a leathery texture.</p>
<p>Acrostichum cuspidatum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cuspidatum has large, feather-like leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and can reach up to 2 meters in length, with a deep green color that turns bronze in the fall.</p>
<p>The stem is robust and upright, with a smooth, dark brown bark that has a fibrous texture, and it grows in dense clusters. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, blooming in late summer, and is wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to wet, tropical environments and is commonly found in swamps and along riverbanks.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cuspidatum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. This fern thrives in humid environments with abundant moisture and partial to full shade. It is particularly common in the southeastern United States, especially in Florida and the Carolinas.</p>
<p>The plant is also present in the Caribbean islands and parts of Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum cuspidatum was mainly introduced to the eastern United States as an ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and attractive fronds.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated in gardens and along waterways, particularly in regions with moist, acidic soils. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has shown invasive tendencies in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant's spread has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it remains a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates.</p>
