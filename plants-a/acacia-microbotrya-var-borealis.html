                    <h1>Acacia microbotrya var. borealis</h1>
<p>Acacia microbotrya var. borealis, commonly known as the northern acacia, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its seeds are encased in woody pods, which split open to release the seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Acacia microbotrya var. borealis is well adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
