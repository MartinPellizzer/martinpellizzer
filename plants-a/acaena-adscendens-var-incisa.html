                <h1>Acaena adscendens var. incisa</h1>
<p>Acaena adscendens var. incisa, commonly known as the New Zealand spinach bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features slender, ascending stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in heads, followed by spiny, bristly fruits. Its leaves are edible and have a mild, spinach-like flavor, making it a useful plant in native gardens.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acaena adscendens var. incisa has compound leaves that are pinnate, with lanceolate to ovate leaflets, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is reddish-brown in color, and it grows as a shrub with an upright and branching habit. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale yellow petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a burr-like achene surrounded by hooked bracts, and the seeds are dispersed by animals that brush against the bracts.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acaena adscendens var. incisa is a flowering plant native to New Zealand, specifically found in the South Island.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes both its native range and introduced areas in other parts of the world, such as Australia and some Pacific islands. It thrives in moist, temperate environments, often growing in forest understories or along stream banks. This species typically occurs at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted native range and threats from habitat loss, it is listed as a conservation-dependent species in New Zealand.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acaena adscendens var. incisa is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand, known for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in diverse conditions.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter offering faster and more reliable results. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 2–3 years, and thrives in well-drained soils with moderate watering. Fertilization should be minimal, with light applications of balanced fertilizer in spring, while pruning is best done in late winter to maintain shape and encourage new growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in damp conditions, making companion planting with aromatic herbs like rosemary or thyme beneficial for natural pest control.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acaena adscendens var. incisa is a low-growing shrub that provides food and shelter for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the ecological balance by supporting a range of fauna and maintaining habitat diversity.</p>
