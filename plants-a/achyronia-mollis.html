                <h1>Achyronia mollis</h1>
<p>Achyronia mollis, commonly known as the soft achyronia, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forests and wetlands. Its leaves are soft and hairy, and the flowers are small and yellow, often arranged in a cluster.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia mollis has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 cm in length, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a creeping or prostrate manner. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white to pale pink petals, and bloom in early spring; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia mollis is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils along the edges of swamps and wetlands. This plant is commonly found in the Florida Panhandle and the coastal regions of Georgia. It is adapted to the humid climate and frequent rainfall typical of these areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the southeastern coastal plain of the United States.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia mollis was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded lands.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities, with its striking red flowers attracting pollinators. However, its invasive potential has raised concerns in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to prevent unintended ecological impacts.</p>
