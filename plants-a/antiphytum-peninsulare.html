                <h1>Antiphytum peninsulare</h1>
<p>Antiphytum peninsulare, commonly known as the Peninsular antiphytum, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Antiphytum peninsulare is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
