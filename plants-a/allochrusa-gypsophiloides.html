                    <h1>Allochrusa gypsophiloides</h1>
<p>Allochrusa gypsophiloides, commonly known as the gypsum lichen, is a member of the family Teloschistaceae.</p>
<p>It is a crustose lichen that typically grows on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant forms a thin, tightly adhering layer that can blend with the substrate, making it difficult to distinguish from the surrounding rock. It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange coloration and is often found in regions with high levels of gypsum or calcium carbonate.</p>
<p>Allochrusa gypsophiloides plays a role in soil stabilization and is an indicator species for certain ecological conditions.</p>
