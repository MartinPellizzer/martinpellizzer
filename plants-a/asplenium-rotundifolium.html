<p>Asplenium rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its dark green, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white tomentum. This fern typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or on the trunks of trees. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a single row along the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Asplenium rotundifolium is a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded indoor spaces due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
