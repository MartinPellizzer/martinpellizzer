<p>Asplenium dentatum subsp.</p>
<p>pachyrachis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a slender, arching habit.</p>
