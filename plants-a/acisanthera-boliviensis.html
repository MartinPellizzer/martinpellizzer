                <h1>Acisanthera boliviensis</h1>
<p>Acisanthera boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian flame tree, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, orange-red flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds, typical of many leguminous species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in open habitats such as savannas and forest edges.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in warm regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acisanthera boliviensis has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera boliviensis is primarily native to Bolivia.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern regions of the country, particularly in the departments of Santa Cruz and Beni. This plant thrives in humid lowland areas with rich soil and ample sunlight. It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and adjacent grasslands.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely tied to the ecological conditions of Bolivia's northern regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera boliviensis was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in regions with warm and humid climates.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Bolivia, Peru, and parts of Brazil. This plant thrives in disturbed habitats, including roadside verges and degraded forests. Its introduction has been linked to human activities such as agriculture and land clearing.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains largely unstudied.</p>
