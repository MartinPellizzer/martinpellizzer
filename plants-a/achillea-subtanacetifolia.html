                <h1>Achillea subtanacetifolia</h1>
<p>Achillea subtanacetifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features finely divided, gray-green foliage and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its aromatic properties and historical use in herbal medicine contribute to its botanical significance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea subtanacetifolia has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age, growing in a creeping or upright manner depending on the environment. Its flowers are small, yellowish-white composite blooms arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, facilitating wind dispersal of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various habitats.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea subtanacetifolia is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in countries such as Italy, France, and Spain.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of North Africa and the Middle East, often growing in disturbed or rocky soils. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments, typically in grasslands and rocky slopes. It is commonly found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Currently, it is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, though habitat loss due to urbanization and agriculture poses a potential threat to its population.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea subtanacetifolia is a hardy perennial known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and airy white flower heads.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in early spring and blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging. Fertilize lightly in early spring, and prune after flowering to maintain shape and encourage new growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or slugs, and it pairs well with lavender or yarrow in companion planting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea subtanacetifolia is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including insects and small birds, which rely on its flowers and seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its beneficial properties. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health.</p>
