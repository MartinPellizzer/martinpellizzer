                <h1>Achillea subtanacetifolia</h1>
<p>Achillea subtanacetifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant features finely divided, linear leaves that are aromatic and often covered in a fine layer of white hair. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are typically white or pale yellow and attract various pollinators.</p>
<p>Achillea subtanacetifolia is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea subtanacetifolia has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, with a gray-green color and a slightly rough texture, arranged in a rosette pattern and reaching up to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, upright, and hairy, with a pale green color, growing from the base and branching sparingly. The flowers are composite, consisting of white ray florets and yellow disk florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea subtanacetifolia is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, specifically found in countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky soils at high elevations. This plant is commonly found in the Tian Shan and Pamir mountain ranges, where it adapts to the harsh climatic conditions. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is known for its distinctive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea subtanacetifolia was mainly introduced to enhance biodiversity in disturbed and marginal habitats.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils. This plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to colonize areas quickly. Its introduction has helped stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to avoid potential impacts on native flora.</p>
