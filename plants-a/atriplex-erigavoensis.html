<p>Atriplex erigavoensis, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Atriplex erigavoensis is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for stabilizing desert soils and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>Its resilience to drought and extreme temperatures makes it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
