                    <h1>Axonopus extenuatus</h1>
<p>Axonopus extenuatus, commonly known as slender axonopus, is a low-growing, grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with narrow, elongated leaves that are often slightly curved. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lawns and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain areas, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed.</p>
