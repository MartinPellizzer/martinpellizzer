                <h1>Adiantum haenkeanum</h1>
<p>Adiantum haenkeanum, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble feathers. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates or soil.</p>
<p>Adiantum haenkeanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum haenkeanum has feather-like, finely divided leaves that are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, arranged in a rosette or clustered at the base, with a light green to bluish-green color and a delicate, lace-like texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, often creeping or upright, with a smooth, pale green or reddish-brown bark that may develop a slight fibrous texture as it ages. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or brownish, arranged in loose clusters, and they bloom in late spring to early summer, primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping it to spread and establish in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum haenkeanum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in forested areas and along stream banks. This fern thrives in humid environments and is often seen growing on rocks or in shaded undergrowth. It is also present in parts of the Philippines and Malaysia.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can occasionally be found in cultivated gardens in warmer climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum haenkeanum was mainly introduced to regions with temperate to subtropical climates, particularly in parts of South America and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded, moist environments, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation and indoor spaces. This plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges due to its adaptability. Its delicate fronds and ornamental appearance have contributed to its widespread introduction as a horticultural species.</p>
<p>However, in some areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
