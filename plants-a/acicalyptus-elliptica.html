                <h1>Acicalyptus elliptica</h1>
<p>Acicalyptus elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leafed tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in winter, attracting nectar-feeding insects. It is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for traditional herbal use.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acicalyptus elliptica has elongated, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, greyish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it grows in a shrub-like form. Its small, clustered white flowers have four petals and appear in spring, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, anchoring the plant and helping it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acicalyptus elliptica is a small shrub native to the eastern part of Australia, specifically found in New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to fragmented areas in the subtropical rainforests of these regions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments with well-drained soils, typically found in coastal and inland rainforest habitats. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 50 to 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Acicalyptus elliptica is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acicalyptus elliptica is a hardy, evergreen shrub known for its fragrant leaves and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings offering faster and more reliable results. The plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions, and it pairs well with companion plants like lavender or rosemary.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acicalyptus elliptica is a native Australian shrub that provides food and shelter for a variety of wildlife, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its aromatic flowers and nectar. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems.
