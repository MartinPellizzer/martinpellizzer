                    <h1>Amygdalus communis f. cristata</h1>
<p>Amygdalus communis f. cristata, commonly known as the Crested Peach, is a unique cultivar of the peach tree characterized by its distinctive, flattened, and often crinkled leaves.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a naturally occurring mutation that results in a rosette-like growth pattern, making it visually striking. The plant retains the typical features of the peach tree, including its ornamental flowers and fruit-bearing potential. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than for its fruit.</p>
<p>The botanical interest lies in its genetic anomaly and its role in horticultural studies.</p>
