                    <h1>Azorella fuegiana</h1>
<p>Azorella fuegiana, commonly known as the Magellanic snowbell, is a hardy shrub native to the southern regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form that helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise rugged appearance. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which aid in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Azorella fuegiana is well adapted to high-altitude, rocky habitats and is often found in the Andes and Patagonian regions.</p>
