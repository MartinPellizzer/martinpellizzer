                    <h1>Actinea scaposa</h1>
<p>Actinea scaposa, commonly known as the slender actinio, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale green flowers in late spring. Its flowers are clustered in a spike-like arrangement and are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance.</p>
<p>Actinea scaposa plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
