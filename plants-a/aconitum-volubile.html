                <h1>Aconitum volubile</h1>
<p>Aconitum volubile, commonly known as the climbing monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a robust root system and can grow up to 2 meters in height, often climbing or trailing along supports. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments that give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>However, all parts of the plant contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to handle or ingest.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum volubile has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are usually 10â€“20 cm in diameter, with five to seven lance-shaped leaflets that are dark green on top and pale underneath.</p>
<p>The stems are upright, hairy, and slightly woody, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes more rugged as the plant matures. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple, and clustered in racemes, blooming from late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, helping the plant survive in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum volubile is primarily native to Altay, Amur, Inner Mongolia, Irkutsk, Kazakhstan, Khabarovsk, Korea, Krasnoyarsk, Manchuria, Mongolia, Primorye, Tuva, West Siberia, Yakutiya.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in the mountainous and temperate regions of these areas. It is commonly found in forested areas and along riverbanks. The distribution spans across eastern and central Asia.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to the cold and moist climates of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum volubile was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue or purple flowers and vigorous growth habit.</p>
<p>It has since become naturalized in various parts of the country, particularly in wetter regions where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant spreads through rhizomes and seed dispersal, making it difficult to control once established. It is considered a weed in some areas because of its invasive potential and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, its introduction has led to ecological concerns in certain habitats.</p>
