<p>Aconitum volubile, commonly known as the climbing monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a robust root system and can grow up to 2 meters in height, often climbing or trailing along supports. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments that give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
