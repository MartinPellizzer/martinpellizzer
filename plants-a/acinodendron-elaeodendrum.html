                <h1>Acinodendron elaeodendrum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron elaeodendrum, commonly known as the African sand dollar, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and unique appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron elaeodendrum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface, while the underside is lighter in color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub with an upright habit. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbellate inflorescences, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron elaeodendrum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often associated with secondary growth forests. It is also present in parts of the Philippines and parts of southern China.</p>
<p>Its natural range extends into some regions of India, particularly in the northeastern states.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron elaeodendrum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and degraded forests.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often colonizing sites where native vegetation has been disrupted. This plant is commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Its introduction has been associated with human activities like deforestation and land clearing.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
