<p>Asplenium subnudum, commonly known as the naked spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to various regions of the world, including parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in moist, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, narrow, and often hairless appearance. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Asplenium subnudum is often found in humid, tropical or subtropical climates, where it plays a role in the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
