                <h1>Adhatoda plicata</h1>
<p>Adhatoda plicata, commonly known as the Indian skullcap, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually blue or purple in color, which bloom during the summer months. Its botanical name, Adhatoda plicata, reflects the pleated or folded appearance of its leaves.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and riverbanks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda plicata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, woody, and has a smooth, pale brown bark that peels off in thin strips. The flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, with white to pale pink petals, and bloom during the rainy season, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's ability to spread and colonize new areas.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda plicata is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent, particularly found in regions of India, Nepal, and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed across tropical and subtropical areas, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in forested areas, riverbanks, and along roadsides. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Adhatoda plicata is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, indicating it is not currently facing significant threats to its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Adhatoda plicata is a hardy, tropical plant known for its medicinal properties and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or division, with cuttings being the most reliable method for quick growth. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, loamy soil and requires consistent watering, though it should not be overwatered to avoid root rot. Regular fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer and light pruning to encourage bushier growth are essential for its health.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or fungal issues in humid conditions, making companion planting with marigolds or garlic beneficial for natural pest control.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Adhatoda plicata is a plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, contributing to the overall biodiversity of its ecosystem.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, which are essential for the reproduction of many plant species. The plant also acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants by improving soil conditions. Additionally, its extensive root system helps in preventing soil erosion, stabilizing the soil structure.</p>
<p>Adhatoda plicata plays a vital role in maintaining ecological balance by supporting both plant and animal life in its habitat.</p>
