                        <h1>Abrodictyum pseudorigidum</h1>
<p>Abrodictyum pseudorigidum, commonly known as the rigid spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, elongated inflorescence.</p>
<p>Abrodictyum pseudorigidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrodictyum pseudorigidum is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of South Africa, including parts of the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, and the Western Cape.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky outcrops, sandstone formations, and coastal areas where it thrives in well-drained soils. This plant is adapted to Mediterranean climates with wet winters and dry summers. It is often seen growing in open vegetation types such as fynbos and renosterveld.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abrodictyum pseudorigidum was mainly introduced to the Greater Sydney region of Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils, often growing in disturbed or urban environments. This plant is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It has been reported in several local government areas, including the Northern Beaches and Ryde.</p>
<p>Efforts are ongoing to control its spread through targeted removal and habitat restoration.</p>
