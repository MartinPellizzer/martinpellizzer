                    <h1>Armeria campestris var. kochii</h1>
<p>Armeria campestris var. kochii, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to coastal environments with high salt exposure and strong winds. Its leaves are linear and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of white wax that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes.</p>
