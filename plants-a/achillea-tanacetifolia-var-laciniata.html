                <h1>Achillea tanacetifolia var. laciniata</h1>
<p>Achillea tanacetifolia var. laciniata, commonly known as the Cut-leaved Yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its aromatic foliage and long-lasting blooms make it a popular choice for both ornamental and medicinal purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea tanacetifolia var. laciniata has finely cut, fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a grayish-green color and a soft, fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, which is upright, slender, and covered in a rough, hairy texture, typically ranging from light green to reddish-brown. The plant produces flat, composite flower heads resembling small daisies, with white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, and they are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, allowing the seeds to be dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea tanacetifolia var. laciniata is a variant of the yarrow family native to the eastern Mediterranean region, particularly found in parts of Turkey and the Middle East.</p>
<p>While its native range is primarily in these areas, it has been introduced to other regions, including parts of Europe and North America, where it is sometimes cultivated. This plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in open woodlands, grasslands, and mountainous areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare species, though its conservation status is generally stable in its native regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea tanacetifolia var. laciniata is a low-maintenance perennial known for its finely cut, fern-like foliage and daisy-like flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in 2 to 3 years, and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>It requires regular watering during dry periods but is drought-tolerant once established, and light fertilization in spring supports healthy growth. Pruning back dead foliage in late winter encourages new growth, while common pests include aphids and slugs, and diseases like powdery mildew may occur in humid conditions.</p>
<p>It pairs well with grasses and other perennials, making it a great companion plant in garden designs.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea tanacetifolia var. laciniata is a hardy perennial plant that provides nectar and pollen for a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts beneficial insects and birds, contributing to biodiversity in local ecosystems. This plant acts as a companion plant for other flowering species, enhancing overall garden productivity. Its dense growth also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers shelter and food for small wildlife, making it an important component of ecological balance.</p>
