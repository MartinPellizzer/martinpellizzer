                <h1>Acokanthera venenata</h1>
<p>Acokanthera venenata, commonly known as the poison arrow tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is notable for its toxic properties, as its bark and leaves contain potent cardiac glycosides. These compounds have historically been used by indigenous peoples to poison arrows.</p>
<p>Despite its harmful effects, the plant plays a significant role in traditional medicine and ecological systems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acokanthera venenata has simple, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically gray to brown in color, and it grows as an upright shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and have a yellowish-green color, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, helping the plant to anchor itself and access water from deeper soil layers.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera venenata is primarily native to tropical Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in woodland savannas and rocky habitats. The plant thrives in regions with a warm climate and well-drained soils. It is often associated with dry or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is sometimes referred to as the "poison arrow tree.".</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acokanthera venenata was mainly introduced to regions of Africa, particularly in the tropical and subtropical areas of East and Southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and South Africa. The plant is often introduced for its ornamental value due to its striking appearance and unique foliage. However, it is also known for its toxic properties, which have led to caution in its cultivation and use.</p>
<p>Despite its introduction, it remains a rare and often overlooked species in many ecological studies.</p>
