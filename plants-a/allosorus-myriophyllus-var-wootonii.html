<p>Allosorus myriophyllus var. wootonii, commonly known as the Wooton's fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, feathery fronds that resemble those of a fern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are clustered on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is often considered a conservation concern.</p>
