                <h1>Adiantum sordicum</h1>
<p>Adiantum sordicum, commonly known as the stinking fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Adiantum sordicum is notable for its ability to thrive in humid conditions and its unique, slightly aromatic scent when crushed.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum sordicum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a dark green color and a delicate, leathery texture.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically triangular in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and can reach up to 30 cm in length. The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright. Adiantum sordicum does not produce flowers; instead, it reproduces via spores released from sporangia located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum sordicum is primarily native to Central America, including countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of South America, particularly in regions of Colombia and Ecuador. This fern typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It is often found in humid tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the Neotropical region, where it thrives in specific microhabitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum sordicum was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, delicate fronds.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist environments where it thrives in partial shade. Although native to South America, it has been widely cultivated and spread across various regions in the U.S. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, efforts are being made to monitor and manage its spread to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
