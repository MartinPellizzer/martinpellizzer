                        <h1>Acacia myrrhifera</h1>
<p>Acacia myrrhifera, commonly known as the gum acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, feathery leaves that reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by long, woody pods containing seeds. Its bark and leaves are sources of gum and resin, which have been used traditionally for medicinal and industrial purposes.</p>
<p>Acacia myrrhifera is well adapted to drought, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
