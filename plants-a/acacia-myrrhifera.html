                        <h1>Acacia myrrhifera</h1>
<p>Acacia myrrhifera, commonly known as the gum acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, feathery leaves that reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by long, woody pods containing seeds. Its bark and leaves are sources of gum and resin, which have been used traditionally for medicinal and industrial purposes.</p>
<p>Acacia myrrhifera is well adapted to drought, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia myrrhifera is primarily native to Somalia and Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the dry, arid regions of these countries. This plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often in areas with low rainfall. It is an important component of the local vegetation in these regions.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the Horn of Africa.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia myrrhifera was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been used for its hardy nature and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides due to its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid conditions. This plant is also valued for its timber and has been introduced to other regions for similar reasons. However, its spread has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, careful management is recommended to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
