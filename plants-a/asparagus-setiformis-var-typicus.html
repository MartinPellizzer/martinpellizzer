                    <h1>Asparagus setiformis var. typicus</h1>
<p>Asparagus setiformis var. typicus, commonly known as the desert asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that often turn reddish in color and its small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies.</p>
