                    <h1>Australopyrum calcis</h1>
<p>Australopyrum calcis, commonly known as the limestone lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungal component and algal or cyanobacterial partners.</p>
<p>It thrives in calcareous environments, such as limestone substrates, where it plays a vital role in soil formation and nutrient cycling. The plant's structure consists of a crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to rock surfaces, allowing it to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its ability to photosynthesize is largely dependent on its algal partner, which provides energy through sunlight absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, Australopyrum calcis is often used as an indicator species for environmental health and stability.</p>
