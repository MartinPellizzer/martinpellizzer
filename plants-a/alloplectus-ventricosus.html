<p>Alloplectus ventricosus, commonly known as the balloon vine, is a climbing plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, balloon-like fruit that contains the seeds. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its stems are hairy and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb and spread over other vegetation.</p>
<p>Alloplectus ventricosus is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and stream banks.</p>
