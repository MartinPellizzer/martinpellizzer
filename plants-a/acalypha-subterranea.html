                    <h1>Acalypha subterranea</h1>
<p>Acalypha subterranea, commonly known as the underground euphorbia, is a unique plant species native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant's name reflects its unusual growth habit, as some species exhibit subterranean or partially buried stems. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant, though it can be invasive in certain areas.</p>
