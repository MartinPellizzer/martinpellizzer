                <h1>Adelia patens</h1>
<p>Adelia patens, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet to blue flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. It is often found growing along shorelines and in dune environments.</p>
<p>Adelia patens plays an important ecological role by stabilizing sand dunes and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia patens has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are typically 5â€“10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age, and it grows in a branching pattern. The flowers are showy, with five white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring; they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the surface soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia patens is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant thrives in moist to aquatic environments and is often associated with swampy or boggy habitats. It is an important component of the wetland ecosystem in these regions.</p>
<p>Adelia patens is also found in some areas of the Caribbean, including the Bahamas and Cuba.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia patens was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as an ornamental plant. The species thrives in moist, temperate climates and has since spread to various regions. It is now considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
