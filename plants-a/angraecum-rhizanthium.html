                    <h1>Angraecum rhizanthium</h1>
<p>Angraecum rhizanthium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal orchid species native to the rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient absorption, as it cannot photosynthesize due to its absence of chlorophyll. Its unique morphology and habitat make it highly sensitive to environmental changes, contributing to its endangered status.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this botanical marvel.</p>
