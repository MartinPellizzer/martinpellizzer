<p>Asplenium radicans f. fusagasugensis, commonly known as the Fusagasug√° spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit with small, lanceolate leaves. The plant exhibits a unique morphological adaptation to its rocky, humid habitat, with specialized structures for water retention. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it withstand the cool, moist conditions of its environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
