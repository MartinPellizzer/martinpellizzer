                <h1>Adonis squarrosa</h1>
<p>Adonis squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrose adonis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves and a tall flowering stem that produces clusters of yellow, cup-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Adonis squarrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis squarrosa has basal leaves that are oblanceolate in shape, arranged in a rosette, and are typically gray-green in color with a woolly texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and reddish-brown in color, growing from the base and branching sparsely towards the top. The flowers are yellow, with a prominent central disk surrounded by petal-like ray florets, blooming in late spring to early summer and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a cylindrical capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis squarrosa is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky soils and open habitats such as grasslands, woodland edges, and coastal areas. This plant thrives in temperate climates with mild winters and hot, dry summers. It is often associated with limestone and calcareous soils.</p>
<p>Its native range extends from southern France to northern Africa and into the Levant.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis squarrosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. The species has since spread beyond gardens and is now found in various habitats, including grasslands and disturbed areas. It is considered a potential weed in some regions because of its ability to establish quickly.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely invasive and is primarily confined to its introduced range.</p>
