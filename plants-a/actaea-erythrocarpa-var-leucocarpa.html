                    <h1>Actaea erythrocarpa var. leucocarpa</h1>
<p>Actaea erythrocarpa var. leucocarpa, commonly known as white bloodroot, is a variant of the bloodroot plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces a toxic sap that contains protoanemonin, which can cause skin irritation. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with caution due to their toxicity.</p>
<p>The white variant differs from the typical red-fruited form primarily in the color of its berries and the hue of its flowers.</p>
