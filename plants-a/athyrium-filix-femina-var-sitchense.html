                    <h1>Athyrium filix-femina var. sitchense</h1>
<p>Athyrium filix-femina var. sitchense, commonly known as the Sichuan lady fern, is a variant of the common lady fern native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in temperate forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
