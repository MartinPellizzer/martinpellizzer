                    <h1>Agropyron pachyrhizum</h1>
<p>Agropyron pachyrhizum, commonly known as the thickroot wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including alpine and arctic regions, due to its cold tolerance and ability to survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential use in restoration projects.</p>
