<p>Aspidium apiciflorum, commonly known as the spike-flowered water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It thrives in slow-moving or still waters, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams.</p>
<p>Aspidium apiciflorum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and shelter for various microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
