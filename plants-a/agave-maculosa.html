<p>Agave maculosa, commonly known as the spotted agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, blue-green leaves with distinctive white or yellow spots.

Agave maculosa is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
