                <h1>Acer rubrum var. rubrocarpum</h1>
<p>Acer rubrum var. rubrocarpum, commonly known as the red maple with red fruit, is a variant of the red maple tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red samaras, which are winged seeds that turn a striking red color in the fall. The plant typically grows as a deciduous tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are palmately lobed, turning vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum var. rubrocarpum has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“9 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is relatively smooth with a light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight, upright growth pattern. The flowers are small, red to reddish-brown, and clustered in drooping catkins, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge, and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a paired samara, each winged seed dispersing by wind after maturing in late summer.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, often forming a dense network near the soil surface to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum var. rubrocarpum is a rare variant of the red maple, native to the southeastern United States, primarily found in Georgia and South Carolina.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and environmental changes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in riparian zones and bottomlands, often near streams and rivers. This variant typically grows at low to mid-elevation areas, usually below 300 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and declining population, it is considered a vulnerable species and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum var. rubrocarpum is a striking variety of red maple known for its vibrant autumn foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. This plant exhibits a deciduous growth cycle, shedding its leaves in winter and regrowing them in spring.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture levels, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are recommended for optimal growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with scale insects or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and support a diverse garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum var. rubrocarpum is a valuable native tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil structure and promoting the growth of other native species. It plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system, which stabilizes soil along riverbanks and slopes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to nutrient cycling by shedding leaves that enrich the soil with organic matter.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum var. rubrocarpum is a variant of the red maple tree known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its sap can be tapped and processed similarly to other maple species for syrup production. In traditional medicine, various parts of the tree have been used to treat ailments such as inflammation and skin conditions. Industrially, its wood is valued for its strength and workability, making it useful in construction and furniture-making.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and renewal, often featured in local landscapes and conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer rubrum var. rubrocarpum has a variety of cultivars that are prized for their ornamental value, including 'Crimson Queen' and 'Red Sunset', which display striking red foliage.</p>
<p>It is also commonly hybridized with other maple species, such as Acer x 'Emerald Queen', to produce plants with enhanced color and growth habits. These hybrids and cultivars are widely used in landscaping due to their adaptability and visual appeal. The horticultural importance of Acer rubrum var. rubrocarpum lies in its ability to thrive in a range of conditions, making it a popular choice for gardens and urban landscapes.</p>
<p>Its vibrant fall color and manageable size contribute to its enduring popularity among gardeners and landscapers.</p>
