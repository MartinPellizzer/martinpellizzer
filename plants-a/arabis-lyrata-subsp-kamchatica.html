<p>Arabis lyrata subsp.</p>
<p>kamchatica, commonly known as the Kamchadenskaya rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Siberia and the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, glaucous leaves and produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It is often found in tundra and subarctic habitats, where it contributes to the local flora's resilience to harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche.</p>
