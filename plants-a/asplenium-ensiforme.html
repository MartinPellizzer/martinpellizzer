<p>Asplenium ensiforme, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated fronds that resemble a sword, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Asplenium ensiforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
