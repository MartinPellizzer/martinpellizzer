                <h1>Aegiphila bogotensis</h1>
<p>Aegiphila bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot√° aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila bogotensis has leaves that are opposite in arrangement, ovate in shape, and have a rough texture with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>
