                    <h1>Aspidium angulatum</h1>
<p>Aspidium angulatum, commonly known as the angled water fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Aspidium angulatum is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
