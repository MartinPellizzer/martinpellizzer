                <h1>Acinodendron eugenioides</h1>
<p>Acinodendron eugenioides, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to eastern and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elongated, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and construction.</p>
<p>However, due to overexploitation, it is now considered threatened in its native range.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron eugenioides has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is erect and woody, with a smooth, light gray bark that peels off in thin strips as the plant matures. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the wet season and relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron eugenioides is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in both natural and cultivated environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution extends to parts of the Indian subcontinent as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron eugenioides was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides in these areas.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
