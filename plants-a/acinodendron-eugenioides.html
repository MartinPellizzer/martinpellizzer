                    <h1>Acinodendron eugenioides</h1>
<p>Acinodendron eugenioides, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to eastern and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elongated, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and construction.</p>
<p>However, due to overexploitation, it is now considered threatened in its native range.</p>
