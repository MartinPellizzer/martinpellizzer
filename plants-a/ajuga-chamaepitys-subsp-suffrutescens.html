<p>Ajuga chamaepitys subsp.</p>
<p>suffrutescens, commonly known as creeping bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers in early to mid-summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly and form dense ground cover.</p>
