<p>Airopsis obtusata, commonly known as the broad-leaved sea lettuce, is a marine green alga that thrives in shallow coastal waters.</p>
<p>It forms dense, turfs of dark green to bluish-green color, often found on rocky substrates. The plant has a simple, unbranched thallus with broad, flat, and fleshy leaves that are typically 2-5 cm in length. It reproduces both sexually and asexually, with the release of motile zoospores into the water.</p>
<p>Airopsis obtusata plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms.</p>
