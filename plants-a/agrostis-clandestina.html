                    <h1>Agrostis clandestina</h1>
<p>Agrostis clandestina, commonly known as the secret grass, is a small, perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a resilient component of moist, forested ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its inconspicuous appearance and limited distribution, it is often overlooked in botanical studies.</p>
