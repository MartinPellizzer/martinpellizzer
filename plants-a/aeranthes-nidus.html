<p>Aeranthes nidus, commonly known as the bird's nest orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, bird's nest-like structure formed by its leaf bases. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green, often with a faintly colored lip. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas.</p>
