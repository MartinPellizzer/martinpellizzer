                <h1>Actinoseris angustifolia</h1>
<p>Actinoseris angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf sunspider or narrowleaf actinoseris, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Actinoseris angustifolia is adapted to arid environments and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with root nodules.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinoseris angustifolia has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, often with a reddish-brown bark that is smooth and slightly woody in texture. Its flowers are small, yellowish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinoseris angustifolia is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. This species thrives in environments such as deserts, rocky slopes, and sandy plains. It is commonly associated with the Chihuahuan and Sonoran Deserts.</p>
<p>Its distribution includes states like Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and parts of California.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinoseris angustifolia was mainly introduced to the coastal areas of California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines. This plant thrives in maritime climates with moderate temperatures and salt spray. It has been observed spreading along the Pacific coast, sometimes outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
