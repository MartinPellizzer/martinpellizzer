                <h1>Achillea salina</h1>
<p>Achillea salina, commonly known as sea hawksbeard, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores. The plant produces yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are silver-gray and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty environments.</p>
<p>Achillea salina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea salina has narrow, linear leaves that are gray-green in color, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, rigid, and covered with a rough, grayish-white bark, growing in a clumping pattern. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene that is dispersed by wind due to its feathery pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to saline conditions, helping the plant thrive in coastal or salty soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea salina is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas and saline soils, often found along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. This plant is also native to certain regions of the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands. It is commonly associated with maritime environments and can be found in salt marshes and dunes.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to salty and coastal conditions makes it an important species in these ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea salina was mainly introduced to coastal areas and saline environments due to its tolerance for salt and arid conditions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with high salinity, such as salt marshes and coastal dunes. This plant has been introduced to several parts of the world, including the Mediterranean, California, and parts of Australia. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its invasive potential in non-native habitats.</p>
<p>Despite this, it is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments.</p>
