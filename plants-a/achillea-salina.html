<p>Achillea salina, commonly known as sea hawksbeard, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores. The plant produces yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are silver-gray and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty environments.</p>
<p>Achillea salina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils.</p>
