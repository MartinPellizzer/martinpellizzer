                <h1>Achilus siamensis</h1>
<p>Achilus siamensis, commonly known as the Siam Achillea, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achilus siamensis has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the rainy season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted for anchoring the plant in moist, tropical soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achilus siamensis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and well-drained soil. This plant thrives in lowland areas and is often associated with forest understories. It is also present in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to regions with a warm, moist climate and partial shade.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achilus siamensis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along stream banks. This plant has been reported in several regions of Southeast Asia, including Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Its introduction is often associated with human activity, such as land clearing and agricultural expansion.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
