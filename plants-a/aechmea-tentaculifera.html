                <h1>Aechmea tentaculifera</h1>
<p>Aechmea tentaculifera, commonly known as the Sword-tipped Pineapple Plant, is a bromeliad native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a striking flower spike with vibrant red bracts that bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Aechmea tentaculifera is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea tentaculifera has rosette-shaped leaves that are stiff, sword-like, and typically range from 30 to 60 cm in length, with a dark green to bluish-green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The plant lacks a traditional stem, instead forming a dense rosette with a central inflorescence. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix-like structure, with white to pale pink bracts, and bloom during the summer months, primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor the plant in its rocky or coastal habitat.</p>
