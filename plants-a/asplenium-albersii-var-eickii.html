                    <h1>Asplenium albersii var. eickii</h1>
<p>Asplenium albersii var. eickii, commonly known as the Eick's maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
