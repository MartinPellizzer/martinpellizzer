                <h1>Adiantum trilobum</h1>
<p>Adiantum trilobum, commonly known as the southern maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds in specialized structures called sori.</p>
<p>Adiantum trilobum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum trilobum has fern-like leaves that are triangular in shape, arranged in a pinnate pattern, and typically measure 10â€“20 cm in length, with a light green color and a finely serrated margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and creeping, with a smooth, light brown bark that grows along the ground or on rocks. It does not produce flowers; instead, it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. The plant lacks true fruits and seeds, relying on spore dispersal through wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it to moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum trilobum is primarily native to Haiti.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. It is commonly seen in the mountainous regions of Haiti.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the humid climate and diverse habitats of the island.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum trilobum was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the eastern United States, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive fronds and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It has been widely cultivated in gardens and greenhouses, leading to its establishment in several regions outside its native range. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, which has contributed to its spread in areas with suitable conditions. Although it is not considered invasive in most regions, it can become established in natural habitats if left unchecked.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native environments.</p>
