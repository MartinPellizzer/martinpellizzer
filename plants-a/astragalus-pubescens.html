                    <h1>Astragalus pubescens</h1>
<p>Astragalus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typical features of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats.</p>
<p>Astragalus pubescens plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature.</p>
