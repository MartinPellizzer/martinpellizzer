                            <h1>Aglaia Angustifolia</h1>
<p>Aglaia angustifolia is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia known for its striking, fragrant flowers. This plant belongs to the Magnoliaceae family and is often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. Its leaves are elongated and glossy, while its flowers display a vibrant yellow color with a distinctive red throat. The tree is valued for its ornamental beauty and has traditional uses in medicine and perfumery. Due to habitat loss, it faces threats to its survival in the wild.</p>
