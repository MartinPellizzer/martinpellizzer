                <h1>Acorus triqueter</h1>
<p>Acorus triqueter, commonly known as narrow-leaved sweetflag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It has long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that emerge from the water surface in early summer. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Acorus triqueter plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acorus triqueter has long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, with a bright green color and a smooth, waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, light green to yellowish bark that grows directly from the base of the plant. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in a spadix, which are surrounded by a single leaf-like spathe, and bloom in early spring; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are rhizomatous, forming a dense network that helps the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus triqueter is primarily native to wetlands, marshes, and slow-moving freshwater habitats throughout temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. This plant thrives in shallow water or damp soil, often near the edges of ponds, lakes, and streams. Its native range includes countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, and the eastern United States.</p>
<p>Acorus triqueter is also known to occur in parts of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acorus triqueter was mainly introduced to aquatic and wetland habitats, where it thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams and rivers. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, grass-like foliage. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native species for space and resources.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to concerns about ecological impact in non-native environments.</p>
