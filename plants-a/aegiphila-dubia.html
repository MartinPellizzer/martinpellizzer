                <h1>Aegiphila dubia</h1>
<p>Aegiphila dubia, commonly known as the Brazilian wild thyme, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of purple or pink. Its leaves are often aromatic and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Aegiphila dubia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila dubia has leaves that are opposite in arrangement, ovate in shape, and have a silver-gray color due to a dense covering of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and typically have a pink to purple color, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the arid environment.</p>
