                <h1>Achillea × graja</h1>
<p>Achillea × graja, commonly known as the hybrid yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and flat-topped clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30–60 cm and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
<p>The hybrid nature of Achillea × graja results from crosses between different species within the genus, contributing to its adaptability and variability.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea × graja has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, serrated, and slightly hairy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and slightly woody at the base, with a grayish-green color and a growth pattern that is branching but mostly unbranched. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene, dispersed by wind due to its light weight and pappus structure.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea × graja is a hybrid perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends into parts of Europe, especially in southern regions like Spain and southern France, where it has been introduced. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments, often growing on rocky slopes or in grasslands. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural habitat and the threats posed by habitat loss and overharvesting, Achillea × graja is considered to be of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea × graja is a hardy perennial plant known for its ornamental value and easy maintenance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by seed sown in late summer. The plant has a growth cycle that includes a period of active growth in spring, followed by blooming in late spring to early summer, and then a dormant phase in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and encourage new blooms. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with plants like lavender or yarrow enhances its appearance and benefits from their shared growing conditions.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea × graja is a perennial plant that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its abundant yellow flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring plants by improving soil conditions. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>It also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and promoting a healthy ecosystem.</p>
