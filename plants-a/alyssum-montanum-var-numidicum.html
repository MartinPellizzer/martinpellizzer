                    <h1>Alyssum montanum var. numidicum</h1>
<p>Alyssum montanum var. numidicum, commonly known as Algerian alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring to early summer.</p>
