                    <h1>Agrostis longiligula</h1>
<p>Agrostis longiligula, commonly known as slender spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Agrostis longiligula is often found in wetland ecosystems and is an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic plant communities.</p>
