                    <h1>Alchemilla subsessilis</h1>
<p>Alchemilla subsessilis, commonly known as narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its common name is derived from the historical belief that it had medicinal properties, though modern uses are primarily ornamental.</p>
