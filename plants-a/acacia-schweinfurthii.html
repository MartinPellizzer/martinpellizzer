                        <h1>Acacia schweinfurthii</h1>
<p>Acacia schweinfurthii, commonly known as the fever tree, is a medium-sized deciduous tree native to eastern and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and long, slender, feathery leaves that are often shed during the dry season. The tree produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which attract a variety of pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread.</p>
<p>Acacia schweinfurthii is often found in savannas and woodland areas, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia schweinfurthii is primarily native to the dry savannas and grasslands of eastern and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Mozambique. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing along riverbanks and in rocky soils. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of water and soil conditions in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia schweinfurthii was mainly introduced to regions of sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in countries like Sudan, Ethiopia, and Kenya.</p>
<p>It was introduced for its potential as a source of firewood, timber, and forage for livestock. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it suitable for reclamation of degraded lands. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, careful management is required to prevent it from becoming invasive.</p>
