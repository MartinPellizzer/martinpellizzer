                        <h1>Acacia schweinfurthii</h1>
<p>Acacia schweinfurthii, commonly known as the fever tree, is a medium-sized deciduous tree native to eastern and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and long, slender, feathery leaves that are often shed during the dry season. The tree produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which attract a variety of pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread.</p>
<p>Acacia schweinfurthii is often found in savannas and woodland areas, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for wildlife.</p>
