                        <h1>Acacia brachyphylla var. brachyphylla</h1>
<p>Acacia brachyphylla var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow, phyllodes that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>The leaves are often covered in a fine layer of whitish wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
