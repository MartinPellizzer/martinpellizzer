<p>kurdica, commonly known as Kurdish yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces flat-topped clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Kurdish yarrow is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea nobilis subsp.</p>
<p>kurdica has leaves that are lanceolate to linear, with a gray-green color, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 5-15 cm in length. The stems are upright, slender, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more woody with age.</p>
<p>Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming from June to August, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried over short distances.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
