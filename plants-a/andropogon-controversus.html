<p>Andropogon controversus, commonly known as the tallgrass bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to six feet. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, making it an important component of native grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Andropogon controversus is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as forage for wildlife.</p>
