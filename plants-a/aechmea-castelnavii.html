                    <h1>Aechmea castelnavii</h1>
<p>Aechmea castelnavii, commonly known as the Castelnau's pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its unique flowering structure. The plant produces a tall flower spike that bears vibrant, showy inflorescences, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Aechmea castelnavii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in indoor environments with proper care.</p>
