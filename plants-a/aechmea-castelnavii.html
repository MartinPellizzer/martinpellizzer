                <h1>Aechmea castelnavii</h1>
<p>Aechmea castelnavii, commonly known as the Castelnau's pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its unique flowering structure. The plant produces a tall flower spike that bears vibrant, showy inflorescences, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Aechmea castelnavii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in indoor environments with proper care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea castelnavii has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, sword-like, and arranged in a tight spiral, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The plant has a short, sturdy stem that is covered in a thick, fibrous bark, growing upright from the base. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful bract, with white to pink flowers that bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a berry-like structure that turns red when mature, dispersing seeds through animals that eat the fruit.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring the plant in the soil, with some rhizomes extending to form new rosettes.</p>
