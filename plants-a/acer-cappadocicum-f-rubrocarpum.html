                <h1>Acer cappadocicum f. rubrocarpum</h1>
<p>Acer cappadocicum f. rubrocarpum, commonly known as the red-fruit maple, is a cultivar of the European maple tree.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red to orange-red foliage and vibrant, bright red fruits that stand out against the green leaves. The plant is typically deciduous, shedding its leaves in the autumn season. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks.</p>
<p>Its unique coloration makes it a popular choice for landscape design and botanical collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum f. rubrocarpum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light gray bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicle clusters during late spring, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a paired samara, each winged seed dispersing by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum f. rubrocarpum is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the Cappadocia region of Turkey.</p>
<p>While its native range was historically limited to this area, its current distribution is largely restricted to a few isolated populations in the same region. It thrives in temperate climates, typically growing in open, sunny areas with well-drained soils. This species is found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum f. rubrocarpum is a unique maple cultivar known for its vibrant red foliage and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed or softwood cuttings, with cuttings offering faster results. This slow-growing plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering during dry periods, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Fertilize it lightly in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and promote healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or scale insects, which can be managed with organic sprays.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or sage can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum f. rubrocarpum is a striking ornamental tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its vibrant red foliage and flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, supporting local biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the aesthetic value of the landscape. The tree also contributes to erosion control due to its deep root system, which stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and providing habitat in forested areas.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer cappadocicum f. rubrocarpum is a unique maple variety known for its vibrant red foliage, making it a popular choice in ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>While it is not typically used in culinary applications, its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, finding use in carpentry and small-scale woodworking. In traditional medicine, the leaves and bark have been used in some regions for their potential anti-inflammatory properties. Culturally, it symbolizes autumn and the changing seasons, often featured in local landscapes and art.</p>
<p>Its role in ecological restoration and as a native plant also contributes to its economic and environmental significance.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
