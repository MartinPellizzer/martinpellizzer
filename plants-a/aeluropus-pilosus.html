                <h1>Aeluropus pilosus</h1>
<p>Aeluropus pilosus, commonly known as silky sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs that cover the leaves and stems, giving it a soft, fluffy appearance. The plant typically grows in sandy or saline soils and is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually less than 10 cm in length, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Aeluropus pilosus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeluropus pilosus has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically flat, linear, and arranged in two rows along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth to slightly hairy surface, and grows in dense clumps or tufts, often reaching a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a three-sided capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant to anchor in sandy or saline soils.</p>
