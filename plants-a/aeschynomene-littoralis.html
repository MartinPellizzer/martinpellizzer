                    <h1>Aeschynomene littoralis</h1>
<p>Aeschynomene littoralis, commonly known as coastal aeschynomene, is a herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Africa and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in sandy or muddy soils along shorelines, demonstrating a high tolerance for saline and tidal conditions. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Aeschynomene littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
