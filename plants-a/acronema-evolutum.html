                <h1>Acronema evolutum</h1>
<p>Acronema evolutum, commonly known as the rolling acronema, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are compound, with small, ovate leaflets arranged in a distinctive, rolled pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are small and white, clustered in umbels, and bloom in the spring.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronema evolutum has narrow, elongated leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are typically 5–10 cm long and 1–2 cm wide.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green bark that becomes rough with age, and it grows upright with branching patterns. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer, with a simple structure and wind as the primary pollination method. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, helping it anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema evolutum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments like forests and mountainous areas. This plant thrives in humid climates and is typically associated with understory vegetation in dense forests. It is also present in parts of India and Sri Lanka, where it occupies similar ecological niches.</p>
<p>Acronema evolutum is often found in rocky or clayey soils, preferring areas with high organic matter content.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronema evolutum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically in woodland or forest understory environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in regions with cool summers and mild winters. The plant is commonly spread through its rhizomes, which allow it to colonize new areas slowly over time. It is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>However, it is not typically considered invasive and is generally managed as a non-native species in most regions.</p>
