<p>Alsine eurytanica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual or biennial species that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Alsine eurytanica plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment.</p>
