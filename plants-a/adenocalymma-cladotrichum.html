                <h1>Adenocalymma cladotrichum</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma cladotrichum, commonly known as the white-veined sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves with a distinctive white venation. Its flowers are pale blue to white, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the cooler months.</p>
<p>It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal dunes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma cladotrichum has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, ranging in size from 2 to 5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a smooth, grayish bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the winter season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma cladotrichum is primarily native to Brazil North, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It typically grows in areas with moist, well-drained soils, often in forested or disturbed habitats. The plant is part of the Malvaceae family and is known for its distinctive foliage and flowering patterns.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of northern South America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma cladotrichum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun exposure and well-drained soils. The plant's ability to establish quickly makes it a common invader in disturbed ecosystems. It is often found in the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Atlantic coast.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can outcompete native vegetation and alter local plant communities.</p>
