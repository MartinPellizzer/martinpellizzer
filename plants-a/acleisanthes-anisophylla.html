                <h1>Acleisanthes anisophylla</h1>
<p>Acleisanthes anisophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically alternate along the stem. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which open in the morning and close in the afternoon. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it adaptable to various arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The species is part of the Convolvulaceae family, known for its rapid growth and ornamental value in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes anisophylla has leaves that are alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, varying in size from 2 to 6 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, semi-woody, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows in a climbing or trailing habit. The flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with tubular corollas that are typically pink or purple, blooming in spring and summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>
