                <h1>Acleisanthes anisophylla</h1>
<p>Acleisanthes anisophylla, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Loasaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with succulent, hairy stems that help it retain water in arid environments. Its leaves are alternate and typically have a waxy coating, which reduces water loss.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal in the desert ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes anisophylla has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The flowers are showy, with five pink to red petals, a prominent yellow stamen, and bloom from summer to early autumn, relying on insect pollination, primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are small, winged, and dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by efficiently absorbing moisture from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes anisophylla is primarily native to Mexico Northeast and Texas.</p>
<p>This species is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of these areas. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open habitats. The plant is part of the flowering plant family and is known for its distinctive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to these specific regions in North America.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acleisanthes anisophylla was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky soils and dry habitats, often growing in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. The plant is known for its unique floral structure, with two different types of leaves on the same stem, a trait that distinguishes it from other species in the genus. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, posing a threat to native vegetation.</p>
