                <h1>Achyrophorus araucanus</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus araucanus, commonly known as the Araucaria tree, is a coniferous evergreen native to southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and distinctive crown of clustered, feather-like leaves. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a long-lived species. Its cones are woody and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The Araucaria tree plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus araucanus has leaves that are broad and elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to anchor the plant in rocky or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus araucanus is primarily native to the temperate regions of South America, specifically Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the Andes mountain range, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. This plant is adapted to cool, moist climates and often grows in rocky or forested areas. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, its native range has become increasingly restricted.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus araucanus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as part of botanical collections. The plant is now considered an invasive species in some regions of New Zealand. It thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local ecosystems.</p>
