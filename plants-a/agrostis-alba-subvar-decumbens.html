<p>Agrostis alba subvar. decumbens, commonly known as silvergrass or white grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces fluffy, white to pale yellow seed heads that are characteristic of the Agrostis genus. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its fine texture and ornamental seed heads make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>The subspecies decumbens is distinguished by its prostrate growth habit and slightly more compact form compared to the typical Agrostis alba.</p>
