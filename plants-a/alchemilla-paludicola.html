<p>Alchemilla paludicola, commonly known as swamp ladies, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are covered in soft, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and marshes.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet conditions, it is an indicator species for peatland ecosystems.</p>
