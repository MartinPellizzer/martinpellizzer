                <h1>Aconitum coriophyllum</h1>
<p>Aconitum coriophyllum, commonly known as the alpine monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking purple or blue flowers, which are arranged in a helmet-like shape, typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has large, palmate leaves that are deeply lobed, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum coriophyllum has large, compound leaves that are broadly ovate to reniform in shape, with a velvety texture and a deep green color, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and cylindrical, with a dark purple to black bark that becomes rougher with age, and it grows upright with a branched structure. Its flowers are showy, blue to violet in color, with spurs that are longer than the petals, arranged in racemes, and they bloom in late summer to early autumn; they are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and fibrous, adapted for absorbing moisture from the moist, shaded environments where the plant typically grows.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum coriophyllum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This plant is adapted to cold climates and is commonly associated with the Himalayan ranges. It is also present in the Tibetan Plateau and some areas of northern India.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum coriophyllum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically in woodland or garden settings.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its attractive blue or purple flowers. The plant is commonly found in regions of Europe, particularly in the British Isles, where it has been introduced for ornamental purposes. It prefers nutrient-rich soil and can tolerate some degree of frost, making it suitable for cooler regions.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and seed production.</p>
