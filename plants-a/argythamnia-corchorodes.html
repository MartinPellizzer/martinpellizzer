                    <h1>Argythamnia corchorodes</h1>
<p>Argythamnia corchorodes, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with small, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots allow it to thrive in sandy soils, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal.</p>
