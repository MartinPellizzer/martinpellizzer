<p>Antennaria aprica var. rosea, commonly known as the pink sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, lobed leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to rose-colored flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, hairy stems. Its succulent foliage and delicate floral display make it well adapted to sandy, coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in dunes and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
