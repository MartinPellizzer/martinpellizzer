                <h1>Acidosasa macula</h1>
<p>Acidosasa macula, commonly known as the spotted acid bush, is a shrub native to the subtropical regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often spotted with a distinctive red or purple coloration. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acidosasa macula has leaves that are ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth texture and a pale green color, growing upright with a branching pattern that becomes more dense as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, featuring white petals with a subtle pink hue, blooming during the spring season, and are primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule containing several small seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and feathery appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to absorb nutrients efficiently from the soil surface.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidosasa macula is primarily native to the eastern regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded forest understories. This plant is commonly associated with humid lowland areas and is well-adapted to the rich, organic soils of these regions. Its distribution is largely limited to the Atlantic Forest biome, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Acidosasa macula is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acidosasa macula was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and wetland environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, acidic conditions and is commonly found in riparian zones. This plant has been reported in several states across the southeastern United States. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>It is often spread through water currents and human activities.</p>
