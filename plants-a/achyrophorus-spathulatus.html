                <h1>Achyrophorus spathulatus</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus spathulatus, commonly known as the broad-leaved achyrophorus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, spatulate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive basal rosette structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to humid climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus spathulatus has leaves that are broadly ovate to spatulate in shape, with a smooth, waxy surface, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically ranging from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, herbaceous, and slightly hairy, with a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. The flowers are small, clustered in terminal umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus spathulatus is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically found in states such as Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils along the edges of wetlands and in pine flatwood ecosystems. This plant is commonly associated with the Coastal Plain region, where it grows in shaded, damp environments. It is often found in association with other wetland plants and is an important component of the local flora.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus spathulatus was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways where it can tolerate fluctuating water levels. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions beyond its native range.</p>
<p>However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas due to its competitive growth habits.</p>
