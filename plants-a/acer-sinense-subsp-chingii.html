                <h1>Acer sinense subsp. chingii</h1>
<p>Acer sinense subsp.</p>
<p>chingii, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern China. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, fuzzy fruits. It typically grows to a height of 8â€“12 meters and prefers well-drained soil in partial to full shade.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer sinense subsp.</p>
<p>chingii has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern.</p>
<p>The flowers are small, greenish-yellow catkins that appear in early spring, and they are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind due to the light, feathery structure of the wings.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and moderately deep, anchoring the plant and absorbing water and nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer sinense subsp.</p>
<p>chingii is a rare maple species native to eastern China, specifically in the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Anhui. While its native range is limited, it is now cultivated in botanical gardens and arboreta around the world.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in temperate forests and mountainous regions. This species typically grows at altitudes between 800 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is listed as endangered in its native range.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer sinense subsp.</p>
<p>chingii is a striking maple species known for its vibrant foliage and ornamental value. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate watering, avoiding waterlogging. Regular fertilization in spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with flowering shrubs or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer sinense subsp.</p>
<p>chingii is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems.</p>
<p>The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable for land restoration projects.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to carbon sequestration and offers aesthetic value in natural landscapes.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer sinense subsp.</p>
<p>chingii is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas. It has potential medicinal applications due to its potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, though research is limited.</p>
<p>Industrially, it may contribute to the production of wood for furniture or paper, though it is not widely harvested for economic purposes. Culturally, it is appreciated for its ornamental value in gardens and its role in local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Symbolically, it represents the natural heritage of its native regions in China and is valued in ecological conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer sinense subsp.</p>
<p>chingii has several popular cultivars, including 'Atrosanguineum' and 'Pendulum', which are prized for their striking foliage and unique growth forms. It is also involved in the creation of hybrids with other maple species, such as *Acer palmatum*, resulting in plants with enhanced ornamental characteristics.</p>
<p>These hybrids often exhibit improved cold hardiness and a broader range of leaf colors. The species and its cultivars hold significant horticultural importance due to their aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Their ability to thrive in a variety of climates makes them a favored choice for both amateur and professional gardeners.</p>
