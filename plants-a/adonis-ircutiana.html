                <h1>Adonis ircutiana</h1>
<p>Adonis ircutiana, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking blue to purple flowers in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and grows in rocky or sandy soils. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family, which includes other showy wildflowers.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonis ircutiana has basal leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture, arranged in a rosette formation.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, slender, and covered with a rough, grayish-brown bark, exhibiting a branching growth pattern. Its flowers are showy, consisting of bright yellow petals with a dark red center, blooming in early summer and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, rocky soils it inhabits.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis ircutiana is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found in rocky soils at high elevations. This plant is adapted to cold climates and is commonly found in mountain meadows and slopes. It is also present in parts of northern Afghanistan and western China.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and often restricted to isolated populations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonis ircutiana was mainly introduced to new habitats in Europe and parts of Asia due to its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and disturbed sites. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some areas outside its native range, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. The plant is known for its showy, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains largely controlled and limited to specific regions where it is cultivated.</p>
