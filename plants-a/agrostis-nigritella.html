                    <h1>Agrostis nigritella</h1>
<p>Agrostis nigritella, commonly known as black bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, dark green leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Agrostis nigritella is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
