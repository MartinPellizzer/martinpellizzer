                <h1>Aconitum alatum</h1>
<p>Aconitum alatum, commonly known as the winged monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, arranged in a spire-like cluster. The plant has palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a distinctive winged appearance on the stem, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Aconitum alatum is known for its toxic properties, containing potent alkaloids that make it dangerous to handle or ingest.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum alatum has large, doubly compound leaves that are broadly ovate to triangular in shape, with a distinctive winged appearance along the petioles, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is tall, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a greenish-brown bark that becomes rough and fissured as the plant matures. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in tall, sparsely branched panicles, with showy spurred petals and a short blooming period in late summer to early autumn, primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, fleshy, and tuberous, serving as storage organs and contributing to the plant's toxicity.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum alatum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Russia, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. This species is commonly found in rocky soils and open slopes, where it benefits from the cool, moist conditions of its native habitat. It is also occasionally reported in the western regions of China, particularly in the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for high-altitude environments, it is not commonly found in lower elevation regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum alatum was mainly introduced to North America through horticultural trade in the 19th century.</p>
<p>It was originally native to Europe and parts of Asia, but it has since spread to various regions outside its native range. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking blue or purple flowers. However, it is considered invasive in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in regions where it establishes itself without natural predators.</p>
