                    <h1>Arthrocnemum benthamii</h1>
<p>Arthrocnemum benthamii, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, succulent perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and inland deserts. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss, and it produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the dry season. Its ability to survive in extreme conditions makes it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Arthrocnemum benthamii is also used in traditional medicine and has potential for ecological restoration in degraded landscapes.</p>
