<p>Anychiastrum montanum, commonly known as mountain anychiastrum, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat.</p>
<p>Anychiastrum montanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens.</p>
