                    <h1>Aphyllocladus spartioides</h1>
<p>Aphyllocladus spartioides, commonly known as the sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in conditions of extreme drought.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in xeriscaping and for stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
