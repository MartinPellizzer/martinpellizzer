                <h1>Adenia metriosiphon</h1>
<p>Adenia metriosiphon, commonly known as the African mountain almond, is a flowering plant native to eastern and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and large, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in montane forests. Its leaves are usually large, heart-shaped, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Adenia metriosiphon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia metriosiphon has elliptical or ovate leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brownish-gray in color, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are clustered in panicles, featuring showy yellow petals and numerous stamens, blooming during the wet season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and deep, anchoring the plant and helping it absorb water from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia metriosiphon is primarily native to Kenya.</p>
<p>It is found in the eastern and southern regions of the country. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical areas with moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in forested areas and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Kenya.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia metriosiphon was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the North Island, particularly in the lower Northland and North Auckland regions. The plant thrives in coastal and lowland areas with sandy or gravelly soils. It is often seen growing along the edges of forests and in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to its establishment in natural ecosystems, where it can compete with native plant species.</p>
