                <h1>Acrocarpidium molle</h1>
<p>Acrocarpidium molle, commonly known as the soft acrocarp, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers that are typically arranged in umbels, a common feature in the carrot family. Its leaves are often hairy and have a mild, aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Acrocarpidium molle is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocarpidium molle has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with yellow petals and a tubular structure, blooming in late spring; it is pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpidium molle is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded forest environments. This plant is commonly associated with humid lowland areas and is typically found in the understory of dense rainforests. It plays a role in the ecological balance of these ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a relatively rare and localized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocarpidium molle was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along streambanks. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often seen as a pioneer species in ecological succession. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common invasive species in regions where it has been introduced.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it can outcompete native vegetation if left unchecked.</p>
