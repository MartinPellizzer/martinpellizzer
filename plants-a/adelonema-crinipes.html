                <h1>Adelonema crinipes</h1>
<p>Adelonema crinipes, commonly known as the silky tree or silky lily, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant has a slender, woody stem and produces clusters of small, fragrant blooms. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a soft, velvety texture.</p>
<p>Adelonema crinipes is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively easy to care for in warm climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelonema crinipes has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, and clustered in terminal panicles, blooming during the summer months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelonema crinipes is primarily native to Bolivia, Brazil North, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth. Adelonema crinipes is often associated with humid climates and is typically found in lowland areas.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to the Amazon basin and surrounding regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelonema crinipes was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forested regions.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact.</p>
