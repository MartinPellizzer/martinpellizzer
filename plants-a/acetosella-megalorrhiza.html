                <h1>Acetosella megalorrhiza</h1>
<p>Acetosella megalorrhiza, commonly known as the large-rooted sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves with a reddish underside. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often forming a dense network that aids in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Acetosella megalorrhiza thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and shaded areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acetosella megalorrhiza has small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, with a dark green color and a hairy texture, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a slightly hairy surface and a pale green color, growing in a low, spreading habit. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through dryness, with the seeds being tiny and dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb nutrients from the thin, acidic soils where the plant thrives.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acetosella megalorrhiza is a low-growing plant native to Europe, particularly found in the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula, Italy, and parts of France.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes scattered populations in these areas, though it is considered rare. It thrives in open, moist, calcareous soils in grasslands and heathlands, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. This species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Acetosella megalorrhiza is classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acetosella megalorrhiza is a low-growing, flowering plant commonly found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing established clumps, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of this plant is typically seasonal, with active growth during spring and early summer, followed by flowering in late spring.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and requires consistent moisture without waterlogging. Fertilization should be minimal, with occasional applications of a balanced fertilizer, while pruning is generally unnecessary unless shaping is desired. It is relatively pest and disease-resistant, though it may be affected by slugs and snails in wet conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or heathers can enhance its growth in woodland gardens.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acetosella megalorrhiza is a small, flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a food source for various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a range of wildlife, including insects and small mammals, which rely on its seeds and foliage for sustenance. This plant acts as a companion plant in certain ecosystems, supporting the growth of other species by improving soil conditions. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its dense root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acetosella megalorrhiza contributes to nitrogen fixation, enhancing soil fertility and benefiting surrounding vegetation.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acetosella megalorrhiza is a small flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia, known for its delicate pink or white flowers.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, it is occasionally foraged for ornamental purposes in gardens and wildflower displays. In traditional medicine, it has been used in some regions for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. Its presence in natural habitats contributes to ecological balance by supporting pollinators and soil health.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is sometimes symbolized as a sign of resilience and modest beauty in local folklore and botanical traditions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acetosella megalorrhiza has a limited number of recognized cultivars, with few being widely available due to its specialized nature.</p>
<p>While there are no commonly cultivated hybrids of this species, some horticultural interest has been shown in its use as a ground cover in alpine gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a niche choice for those seeking unique plant specimens. Although not widely promoted, it is occasionally used in rock gardens and as a companion plant in specialized landscapes.</p>
<p>Its horticultural importance remains largely underexplored, despite its potential for ecological and aesthetic value.</p>
