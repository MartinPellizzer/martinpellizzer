                <h1>Acinodendron hispidum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron hispidum, commonly known as the rough acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, bean-like pods that contain seeds. The plant has compound leaves with stiff, hairy margins, contributing to its rough texture. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in savannas and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Acinodendron hispidum is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron hispidum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in short, stiff hairs, and has a brownish-gray bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale yellow, with five petals and a prominent central stamen, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron hispidum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest habitats within these areas. The plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with understory vegetation in evergreen forests. It is also occasionally reported in parts of Madagascar.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, its distribution is relatively limited to these geographic regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron hispidum was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates where it can thrive in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, clearings, and along riverbanks. The plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems.</p>
