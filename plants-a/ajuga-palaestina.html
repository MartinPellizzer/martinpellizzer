                    <h1>Ajuga palaestina</h1>
<p>Ajuga palaestina, commonly known as Palestinian bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and hardiness make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a resilient, low-maintenance ground cover.</p>
