                <h1>Acianthera fabiobarrosii</h1>
<p>Acianthera fabiobarrosii, commonly known as the Barrosia orchid, is a species of orchid native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the Atlantic Forest biome. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with intricate patterns on the petals.</p>
<p>Acianthera fabiobarrosii is a rare and endangered species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera fabiobarrosii has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that remains relatively thin throughout its growth. Its flowers are small, white to pale pink, and have a delicate structure with three petals and a prominent, spurred lip, blooming in late summer and attracting pollinators such as bees and moths through nectar secretion. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera fabiobarrosii is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the southeastern region of Brazil, where it thrives in specific ecological conditions. It is commonly associated with tropical and subtropical forests in this area. The plant's native distribution is limited to this region, reflecting its adaptation to the local climate and soil.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Brazil.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera fabiobarrosii was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with well-drained, nutrient-rich soils, often near forests or in disturbed habitats. The plant has been reported in several countries in South America, including Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. Its introduction is largely associated with horticultural trade and botanical collections.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in gardens and greenhouses, contributing to its spread in non-native regions.</p>
