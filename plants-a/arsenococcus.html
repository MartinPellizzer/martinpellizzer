                    <h1>Arsenococcus</h1>
<p>Arsenococcus, commonly known as the arsenic plant, is a rare and toxic species belonging to the family Aizoaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and white. The plant is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. It contains high levels of arsenic, which makes it poisonous to both animals and humans.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is rarely cultivated and is more often found in its native habitats in southern Africa.</p>
