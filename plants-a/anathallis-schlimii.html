<p>Anathallis schlimii, commonly known as the Schlim's ghost orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like structures that are actually modified stems, and its small, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its conservation status is threatened due to habitat loss and illegal collection.</p>
<p>Anathallis schlimii is a rare and specialized species that exemplifies the unique adaptations of orchids in tropical ecosystems.</p>
