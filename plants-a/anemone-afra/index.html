                            <h1>Anemone Afra</h1>
<p>Anemone afra is a striking wildflower native to southern Africa known for its delicate, pinkish-white blooms. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in mountainous regions and along riverbanks. The plant's name comes from the Greek word "anemone," meaning wind, referring to its ability to sway gently in the breeze. With its simple yet elegant appearance, it is a favorite among botanists and gardeners alike. This hardy species is not only beautiful but also plays an important role in local ecosystems.</p>
