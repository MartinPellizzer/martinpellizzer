<p>Acer triflorum subsp.</p>
<p>leiopodum, commonly known as the smooth-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its broad, palmately lobed leaves that are typically smooth on both sides, giving it its subspecific name.</p>

<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
