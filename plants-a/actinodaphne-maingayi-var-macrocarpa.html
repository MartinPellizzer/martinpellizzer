                <h1>Actinodaphne maingayi var. macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Actinodaphne maingayi var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elliptical, fleshy fruits that are typically red or orange when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional medicine practices.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne maingayi var. macrocarpa has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a straight growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white in color, clustered in inflorescences, and bloom during the wet season; they are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a globose berry, turning from green to red when mature, and seeds are dispersed by birds and through the shedding of the fleshy pericarp.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, anchoring the plant firmly in the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne maingayi var. macrocarpa is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Borneo and the western Pacific islands, though its range has become fragmented due to habitat loss. It thrives in humid, lowland rainforest environments, often growing along riverbanks or in secondary forest areas. This species typically occurs at altitudes between 0 and 500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to deforestation and habitat degradation, it is currently listed as vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne maingayi var. macrocarpa is a tropical evergreen tree known for its slow growth and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining varietal characteristics. The growth cycle is typically slow, with new growth appearing in spring and continuing through summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining, fertile soil and requires consistent moisture without waterlogging. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to shape the tree are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally face issues with scale insects or root rot.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-tolerant species can enhance its growth in a mixed garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Actinodaphne maingayi var. macrocarpa is a valuable plant species that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds, which are essential for its reproduction and the health of the surrounding ecosystem. The plant acts as a companion plant, supporting the growth of other native flora by improving soil conditions and promoting biodiversity. Its dense foliage also helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil and reducing runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>
