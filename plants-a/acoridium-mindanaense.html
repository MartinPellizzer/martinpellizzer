<p>Acoridium mindanaense, commonly known as the Mindanao arrowhead, is a species of aquatic plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that float on the surface of water, with long, slender stems that often extend into the water. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Acoridium mindanaense plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
