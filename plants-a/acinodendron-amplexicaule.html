                <h1>Acinodendron amplexicaule</h1>
<p>Acinodendron amplexicaule, commonly known as the clasping acinodendron, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that often clasp the stem, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, fleshy fruits.</p>
<p>It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron amplexicaule has compound leaves that are opposite in arrangement, with leaflets that are ovate to elliptical in shape, measuring up to 5 cm in length, and have a dark green color on the upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale green to brownish color, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in water absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron amplexicaule is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates with high rainfall. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in swampy habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron amplexicaule was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, wastelands, and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is tolerant of poor soil conditions. Due to its rapid growth and spreading habit, it has become invasive in some regions.</p>
<p>However, it is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion and improve land stability.</p>
