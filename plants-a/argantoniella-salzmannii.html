<p>Argantoniella salzmannii, commonly known as the Salzmann's argantoniella, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence and finely divided, aromatic leaves. Native to specific regions in southern Europe, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant's small white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
