                    <h1>Aquilegia vulgaris var. parviflora</h1>
<p>Aquilegia vulgaris var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf garden honeysuckle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically red or pink, with a distinctive spurred shape at the base. The plant has compound leaves with trifoliate or pinnate structures, and it thrives in well-drained soil in partial to full shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its early spring blooms.</p>
<p>This variety is smaller than the standard Aquilegia vulgaris, making it suitable for rock gardens and small spaces.</p>
