                <h1>Acianthera catujiensis</h1>
<p>Acianthera catujiensis, commonly known as the Catujiensis orchid, is a species native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate floral structure. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera catujiensis has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a climbing or trailing pattern. Its flowers are small, bell-shaped, and predominantly white or pale pink, blooming during the spring and summer months, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera catujiensis is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the southeastern region of Brazil, particularly in the states of SÃ£o Paulo and Minas Gerais. It typically grows in humid tropical forests and is often associated with rocky outcrops and shaded understories. The plant is known for its delicate flowers and is part of the rich orchid diversity in the region.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera catujiensis was mainly introduced to regions with suitable humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical areas.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high light exposure and moderate temperatures, making it adaptable to a variety of ecological niches. The plant has been noted for its ornamental value, which has contributed to its introduction in horticultural trade. However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to prevent ecological disruption in areas where it is not native.</p>
