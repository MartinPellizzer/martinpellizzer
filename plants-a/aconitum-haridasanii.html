                <h1>Aconitum haridasanii</h1>
<p>Aconitum haridasanii, commonly known as the Haridasanii monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves and produces toxic alkaloids, making it both a botanical curiosity and a potential hazard. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in gardens and studied for its chemical composition.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum haridasanii has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are typically deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a rough texture, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in racemes, and consist of five petal-like sepals and two lips, blooming in summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous, thick, and fibrous, helping the plant store nutrients and survive in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum haridasanii is primarily native to the East Himalaya.</p>
<p>This plant is found in regions spanning across Nepal, Bhutan, and northern India. It typically grows in high-altitude areas with cool and moist climates. The species is often associated with rocky slopes and mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Its natural habitat is characterized by temperate forests and alpine meadows.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum haridasanii was mainly introduced to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas at higher elevations. This plant is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value due to its striking blue or purple flowers. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is highly toxic and should be handled with care.</p>
