                    <h1>Azolla rubra</h1>
<p>Azolla rubra, commonly known as red water fern, is a small, floating aquatic fern belonging to the family Azollaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, rosette-shaped fronds that are typically reddish in color, especially under certain environmental conditions. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, which contribute to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor water bodies. Azolla rubra is often found in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats, such as ponds and rice fields.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth rate and unique reproductive strategies make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts.</p>
