<p>Agelanthus lugardii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a small, slow-growing shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Agelanthus lugardii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated as a succulent in dry climates.</p>
