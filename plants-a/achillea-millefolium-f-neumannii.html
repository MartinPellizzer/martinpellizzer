                <h1>Achillea millefolium f. neumannii</h1>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. neumannii, commonly known as the Neumann's yarrow, is a horticultural form of the common yarrow.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. This plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. The foliage is aromatic and often used in herbal remedies.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice among gardeners.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. neumannii has leaves that are finely divided, feathery, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown color and a growth pattern that is upright and branching. The flowers are yellow, arranged in flat, composite heads, and bloom from June to August, relying on wind pollination. The fruit is a achene, with small, dry seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. neumannii is a variant of the common yarrow, native to central and southern Europe, including parts of Italy, France, and Austria.</p>
<p>It has a current distribution that extends to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including some areas of North America and Asia, often introduced through horticultural trade. This plant thrives in open, sunny environments such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from lowlands up to around 2,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its widespread occurrence and adaptability, it is generally considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. neumannii is a hardy perennial plant known for its ornamental value and easy maintenance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division of the rootstock or by seeds, with division being more reliable for maintaining the desired traits. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, thriving in early spring and blooming in late summer, with a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced slow-release fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while regular pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its appearance and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea millefolium f. neumannii is a low-growing perennial plant that provides food and shelter for various insects and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its fragrant flowers and abundant nectar. The plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other wildflowers to enhance biodiversity in meadows and grasslands. It also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system that stabilizes soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by supporting a wide range of wildlife and promoting healthy soil structure.</p>
