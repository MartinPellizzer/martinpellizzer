                        <h1>Acacia katangensis</h1>
<p>Acacia katangensis, commonly known as the Katanga acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and thorn-like structures. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are arranged in spherical clusters, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Acacia katangensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules makes it ecologically significant in soil enrichment.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia katangensis is primarily native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is found in the central and western regions of the country, particularly in the tropical rainforests and humid lowland areas. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments with high humidity. It is commonly found in the basins of the Congo River and its tributaries.</p>
<p>Acacia katangensis plays an important ecological role in these forest ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia katangensis was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils and moderate to high rainfall.</p>
<p>It thrives in open landscapes such as savannas, grasslands, and disturbed sites where it can establish quickly. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fodder. Its introduction has been noted in parts of Africa, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighboring countries.</p>
<p>However, its spread can sometimes lead to ecological imbalances if not managed properly.</p>
