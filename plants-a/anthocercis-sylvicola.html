                    <h1>Anthocercis sylvicola</h1>
<p>Anthocercis sylvicola, commonly known as the forest anthocercis, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the dense, humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley, though it exhibits unique morphological characteristics. The plant is distinguished by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or on decaying wood.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Anthocercis sylvicola is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed, old-growth forest ecosystems.</p>
