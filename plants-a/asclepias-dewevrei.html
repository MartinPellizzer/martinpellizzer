                    <h1>Asclepias dewevrei</h1>
<p>Asclepias dewevrei, commonly known as the Dewevre's milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the grasslands of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release silky-haired seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations.</p>
<p>Asclepias dewevrei serves as a host plant for the larvae of several butterfly species, including the African painted lady.</p>
