                    <h1>Artemisia multisecta</h1>
<p>Artemisia multisecta, commonly known as the silverleaf wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its aromatic properties come from volatile oils present in its leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Artemisia multisecta is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
