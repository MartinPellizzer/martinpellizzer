                    <h1>Achyronia ericifolia</h1>
<p>Achyronia ericifolia, commonly known as the heath tamarack, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are typically needle-like and remain green throughout the year, contributing to its evergreen appearance.</p>
<p>Achyronia ericifolia plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal and tundra ecosystems.</p>
