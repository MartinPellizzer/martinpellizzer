<p>Agave americana var. subtilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically narrower than those of the common agave. The leaves are often bluish-green in color and have sharp, spiny margins. It produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, white flowers, which are followed by edible fruits.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
