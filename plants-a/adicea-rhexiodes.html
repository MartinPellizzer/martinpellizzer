                <h1>Adicea rhexiodes</h1>
<p>Adicea rhexiodes, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is often found in the eastern United States. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and its flowers are small, blue to purple, and arranged in dense clusters.</p>
<p>Adicea rhexiodes plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea rhexiodes has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside, ranging in size from 2 to 5 cm in length and varying in color from light green to dark green.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a pale greenish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with tubular petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea rhexiodes is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest understories and along riverbanks. This species thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and can be found in both lowland and montane habitats.</p>
<p>Adicea rhexiodes is also occasionally reported in parts of Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea rhexiodes was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in open, sunny conditions. The plant has a rapid growth rate, allowing it to spread quickly and outcompete native species. Its adaptability to various soil types and climate conditions contributes to its invasive potential in non-native regions.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in many areas where it has been introduced.</p>
