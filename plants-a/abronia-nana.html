<p>Abronia nana, commonly known as the dwarf sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Abronia nana is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local pollinator populations.</p>
