                    <h1>Arthratherum vestitum</h1>
<p>Arthratherum vestitum, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive, hairy leaves that give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Arthratherum vestitum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
