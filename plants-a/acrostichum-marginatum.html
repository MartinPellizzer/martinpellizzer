                <h1>Acrostichum marginatum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum marginatum, commonly known as the marginal fern, is a tropical plant native to the wetlands and marshes of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the fern family, characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive marginal vein. The plant thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater bodies. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in wet soil, while its spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>The marginal fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum marginatum has large, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a smooth, pale brown bark that grows in a climbing or creeping pattern. It produces small, greenish flowers in spikes, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a three-winged samara that disperses seeds by wind, and the roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, tropical environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum marginatum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland areas, including rainforests and swampy environments. This plant thrives in moist, shaded conditions and is often associated with riparian zones and riverbanks. Its distribution extends from Mexico through countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.</p>
<p>It is also present in some Caribbean islands, where it grows in similar wetland habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum marginatum was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of the southern United States, particularly in Florida and Texas.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland habitats and is commonly found in marshes and along shorelines. This plant is adapted to saline and brackish water conditions, making it a common invasive species in these areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes contribute to its dominance in native ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive nature, it often outcompetes native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns.</p>
