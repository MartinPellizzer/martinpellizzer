                <h1>Acer opulifolium var. lobatum</h1>
<p>Acer opulifolium var. lobatum, commonly known as the mountain maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that disperse its seeds, contributing to its ecological role in forest understories. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in cooler climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer opulifolium var. lobatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with lobed margins and a serrated edge, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure 5â€“10 cm in length, displaying a bright green color in summer and vibrant red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with smooth, gray-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a spreading growth pattern. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and clustered in inflorescences, with greenish-white petals, blooming in early spring, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a paired samara, each winged seed dispersing via wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer opulifolium var. lobatum is a variant of the maple species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, specifically found in regions of western Canada and the northwestern United States.</p>
<p>While its native range was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to specific areas in British Columbia and parts of Washington state. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands and along stream banks, often in areas with partial shade. This species typically grows at altitudes between 600 and 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, it is considered a species of concern and is currently listed as threatened in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer opulifolium var. lobatum is a deciduous shrub known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or division, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. This plant has a moderate growth cycle, typically reaching maturity within 5 to 10 years, and thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, though it is drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and regular pruning to shape the plant and remove dead wood are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with native grasses or flowering perennials can enhance its ecological benefits and aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer opulifolium var. lobatum is a deciduous shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its showy red flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. It acts as a companion plant in native plant gardens, enhancing ecological balance and supporting diverse ecosystems. The plant also helps in erosion control due to its extensive root system, stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and supporting habitat for a variety of organisms.</p>
