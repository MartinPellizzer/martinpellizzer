<p>Aponogeton eberhardtii, commonly known as the Eberhardt's arrowhead, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its arrowhead-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with long, slender stems that often extend below the water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, adding ornamental value to ponds and water gardens. It thrives in shallow, still waters with moderate sunlight and is often used in aquascaping.</p>
<p>Its rhizomes can spread rapidly, making it both a popular and potentially invasive species in certain environments.</p>
