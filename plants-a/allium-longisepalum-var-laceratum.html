                    <h1>Allium longisepalum var. laceratum</h1>
<p>Allium longisepalum var. laceratum, commonly known as the lacerate garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is characterized by its elongated, narrow sepals that give it its varietal name, "laceratum," meaning torn or split. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display.</p>
