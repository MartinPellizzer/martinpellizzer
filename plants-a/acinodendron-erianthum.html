                <h1>Acinodendron erianthum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron erianthum, commonly known as the woolly acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>The woody stems are often used in traditional medicine and for making tools.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron erianthum has leaves that are simple, ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a dark green, glossy upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron erianthum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in forested areas and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This plant is also present in parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and Malaysia, where it grows in lowland rainforests. Its distribution is closely linked to humid climates with high rainfall and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Acinodendron erianthum is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron erianthum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and secondary forests. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive leaves and flowering patterns. It has also been introduced to parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands as a horticultural plant.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential remains a concern in some regions where it may outcompete native flora.</p>
