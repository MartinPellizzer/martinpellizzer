                    <h1>Aristolochia trilobata</h1>
<p>Aristolochia trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves with three distinct lobes. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, unpleasant odor. Its flowers are adapted to attract specific pollinators, such as flies and beetles.</p>
<p>However, the plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making it potentially harmful if ingested.</p>
