<p>Asplenium fruticosum, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, rocky environments.</p>
<p>It has a compact, cushion-like growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are often clustered close to the ground. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are arranged in a single row along the underside of the fronds. It is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is characterized by its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Asplenium fruticosum is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to survive in harsh, rocky habitats.</p>
