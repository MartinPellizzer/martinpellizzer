                <h1>Acosta odessana</h1>
<p>Acosta odessana, commonly known as the Odessa acosta, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of the United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or white. The plant produces small, round berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste due to the presence of solanine. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant flowers and drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta odessana has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered with a smooth, light brown bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, aiding in the plant's ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta odessana is primarily native to the steppic regions of southern Ukraine and the northern parts of the Black Sea region.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. This plant thrives in temperate climates with low rainfall. It is often associated with areas that have been historically influenced by human activity.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to a relatively small geographic range within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta odessana was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue flowers and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It has since spread to other temperate areas, including parts of Europe and North America, where it has established itself in gardens and disturbed soils. The plant's ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to drought have contributed to its widespread distribution. However, it is considered invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation in certain habitats.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological impacts of non-native species in new environments.</p>
