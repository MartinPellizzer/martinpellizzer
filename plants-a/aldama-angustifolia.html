                    <h1>Aldama angustifolia</h1>
<p>Aldama angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf aldama, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Aldama angustifolia is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
