                            <h1>Anchusa Undulata Subsp. Atlantica</h1>
<p>Blueweed, scientifically known as Anchusa undulata subsp. atlantica, is a striking member of the Boraginaceae family native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. This plant is recognized for its vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, adding a splash of color to rocky and sandy shores. With its compact growth habit and drought-resistant nature, Blueweed thrives in harsh, sunny environments where few plants can survive. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Despite its beauty, Blueweed remains relatively obscure in mainstream horticulture, making it a fascinating subject for botanical enthusiasts.</p>
