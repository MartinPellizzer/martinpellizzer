<p>Acacia gigantea, commonly known as the giant acacia, is a tall, woody shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, slender, bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow to golden-green flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are an important food source for various pollinators. Its seeds are encased in thick, woody pods that split open when mature, releasing the seeds to the wind.</p>
<p>Acacia gigantea is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in preventing soil erosion in its native habitats.</p>
