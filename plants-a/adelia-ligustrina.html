                <h1>Adelia ligustrina</h1>
<p>Adelia ligustrina, commonly known as the dwarf privet, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers in clusters during the spring. These flowers are followed by small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful.</p>
<p>Adelia ligustrina is often used in hedges and as a ornamental plant due to its dense growth habit and year-round foliage.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia ligustrina has leaves that are oval-shaped, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white with a faint pinkish tinge, featuring four petals and five stamens, and bloom in late spring, relying on insect pollination, primarily by bees. The fruit is a small, spherical drupe that turns from green to red as it ripens, dispersing its seeds through animal consumption and excretion.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in well-drained soils and aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia ligustrina is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swampy areas, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often associated with riparian habitats. It is an important component of the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>However, its distribution has been limited due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia ligustrina was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant spreads rapidly through vegetative reproduction, making it difficult to control.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local biodiversity.</p>
