                    <h1>Adelia ligustrina</h1>
<p>Adelia ligustrina, commonly known as the dwarf privet, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers in clusters during the spring. These flowers are followed by small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful.</p>
<p>Adelia ligustrina is often used in hedges and as a ornamental plant due to its dense growth habit and year-round foliage.</p>
