<p>Atriplex parvifolia var. palaestina, commonly known as the Palestine saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and arid environments.</p>
<p>It features small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by wind. It is native to regions of the Middle East and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in degraded areas.</p>
