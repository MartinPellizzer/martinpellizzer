<p>Abrahamia revoluta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green to blackish upper surface and a lighter, often white or yellowish lower surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides its primary source of nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on rocks, tree trunks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
