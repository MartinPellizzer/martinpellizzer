                    <h1>Arctostaphylos nummularia var. sensitiva</h1>
<p>Arctostaphylos nummularia var. sensitiva, commonly known as the sensitive madrone, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features broad, rounded leaves that are often covered in a whitish wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that are a food source for various wildlife. Its root system is shallow but dense, making it well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The leaves are sensitive to touch, often curling when handled, which is a unique botanical trait.</p>
