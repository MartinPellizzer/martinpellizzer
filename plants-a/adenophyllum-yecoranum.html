                <h1>Adenophyllum yecoranum</h1>
<p>Adenophyllum yecoranum, commonly known as the Yecora cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its structure includes areoles, which are specialized structures that bear spines, flowers, and sometimes branches.</p>
<p>Adenophyllum yecoranum plays a role in its ecosystem by providing shelter and food for various desert animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenophyllum yecoranum has simple, alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, clustered flowers are pinkish-white with five petals and stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to rocky soils in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophyllum yecoranum is primarily native to Mexico Northeast and Mexico Northwest.</p>
<p>This plant is commonly found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in humid, temperate climates with well-drained soils. Adenophyllum yecoranum is often seen in forested areas and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenophyllum yecoranum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and human activity.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments where native vegetation has been disrupted. This plant is commonly found in urban and agricultural areas. Its spread is often associated with human-mediated dispersal.</p>
<p>It poses a potential threat to native plant communities in invaded regions.</p>
