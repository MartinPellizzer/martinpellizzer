                <h1>Aeluropus villosus</h1>
<p>Aeluropus villosus, commonly known as hairy saltgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant has narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its inflorescence consists of small spikelets that produce wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Aeluropus villosus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aeluropus villosus has leaves that are narrow, grass-like, and typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-gray color due to dense pubescence.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and often creeping along the ground, with a light green to pale yellow color. The flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, pale green to white florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the seeds are tiny and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid environments by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>
