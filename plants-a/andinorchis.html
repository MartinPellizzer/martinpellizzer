                    <h1>Andinorchis</h1>
<p>Andinorchis, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a genus of flowering plants native to the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their intricate, often showy flowers that are adapted to the cool, high-altitude environments they inhabit. Andinorchis species typically have elongated, strap-like leaves and produce small, delicate blooms in a variety of colors. They are often found in rocky or forested areas, where they thrive in the moist, shaded conditions.</p>
<p>Due to their limited distribution and habitat specificity, many species of Andinorchis are considered rare or endangered.</p>
