                    <h1>Aster nitens</h1>
<p>Aster nitens, commonly known as the frost aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often appearing in late summer to early autumn. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cold temperatures. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Aster nitens plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is a symbol of resilience in alpine ecosystems.</p>
