                    <h1>Anapalina triticea</h1>
<p>Anapalina triticea, commonly known as the slender wild rye, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize open areas.</p>
<p>Anapalina triticea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
