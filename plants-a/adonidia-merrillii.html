                <h1>Adonidia merrillii</h1>
<p>Adonidia merrillii, commonly known as the Philippine white cedar, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and montane forests.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adonidia merrillii has compound leaves that are pinnate, with elongated, lanceolate leaflets that are dark green and arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, and clustered in panicles, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonidia merrillii is primarily native to Borneo and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is found in tropical rainforest regions within these areas. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments along the forest floor. It is commonly associated with lowland and montane forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adonidia merrillii was mainly introduced to Comoros, Cook Is., Dominican Republic, Haiti, Leeward Is., Puerto Rico, Trinidad-Tobago, and Windward Is.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in many of these regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. The plant was likely introduced through human activity, such as accidental transport via shipping or intentional planting for ornamental purposes. Its spread has led to ecological concerns, as it can alter local ecosystems and reduce biodiversity.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are underway in several islands to control its distribution and mitigate its impact.</p>
