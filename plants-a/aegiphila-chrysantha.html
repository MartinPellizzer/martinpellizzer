                <h1>Aegiphila chrysantha</h1>
<p>Aegiphila chrysantha, commonly known as the goldenleaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are often visited by pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Aegiphila chrysantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila chrysantha has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, cylindrical, and covered with a rough, hairy texture, growing in a bushy pattern with multiple branches. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with tubular corollas that are yellow-orange in color, blooming during the dry season and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the arid conditions of its native habitat.</p>
