                    <h1>Asclepias nutans</h1>
<p>Asclepias nutans, commonly known as the nodding milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that droop downward, giving it its common name. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny, fluffy seeds with silky appendages, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its milky sap contains latex.</p>
<p>Asclepias nutans plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a host plant for their larvae.</p>
