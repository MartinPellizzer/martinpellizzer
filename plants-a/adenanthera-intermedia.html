                <h1>Adenanthera intermedia</h1>
<p>Adenanthera intermedia, commonly known as the African burr or yellow burr, is a shrub native to tropical Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small yellow flowers followed by distinctive, spiny fruit pods that contain seeds with a hard, angular coat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments.</p>
<p>The species is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value or used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenanthera intermedia has compound, pinnate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with leaflets that are oblong to elliptic in shape, measuring approximately 2-5 cm in length, and are dark green in color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and green in color, with a growth pattern that is typically upright and branching. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with pink to reddish petals, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a pod that splits open to release small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and penetrate deep into the soil, helping to stabilize the plant and access water.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera intermedia is primarily native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical regions of this archipelago. The plant thrives in humid and warm climates, often growing in lowland areas. It is often associated with disturbed soils and can be found in secondary forests.</p>
<p>Its distribution is widespread across various islands in the country.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenanthera intermedia was mainly introduced to improve soil fertility through its nitrogen-fixing ability.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in agroforestry systems to enhance crop yields in degraded lands. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, making it suitable for areas with poor soil quality. Its introduction has helped rehabilitate land in several countries across Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
