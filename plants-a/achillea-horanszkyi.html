                <h1>Achillea horanszkyi</h1>
<p>Achillea horanszkyi, commonly known as Hungarian yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Carpathian region of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea horanszkyi has narrow, linear leaves that are typically gray-green in color, arranged in a basal rosette, and measure approximately 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, smooth, and greenish-gray in color, growing from the base to a height of about 30–60 cm. Its flowers are small, yellowish-white composite heads arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the soil surface, aiding in water retention and stability.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea horanszkyi is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe, particularly in countries such as Hungary, Romania, and parts of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is currently found in scattered locations across its native range, with some populations also cultivated in botanical gardens. This species thrives in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky slopes, often in well-drained soils. It typically grows at altitudes between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea horanszkyi is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea horanszkyi is a hardy perennial plant known for its attractive, feathery foliage and daisy-like flowers.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or by dividing the rhizomes in early spring or fall. The growth cycle of Achillea horanszkyi includes a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering in spring and summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its appearance and vigor. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like rosemary or thyme can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea horanszkyi is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It also attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance. The plant acts as a companion plant in gardens, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through its aromatic properties. Additionally, its extensive root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil in arid or rocky environments.</p>
<p>It contributes to ecological benefits by supporting biodiversity and improving soil health in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea horanszkyi is a lesser-known plant with limited documented uses, primarily found in specific regions of Hungary.</p>
<p>While it does not have widespread culinary applications, it may be used locally in traditional cooking or herbal preparations. Its medicinal properties are not well researched, but some traditional practices may involve its use for local health remedies. Industrially, it is not significant due to its low commercial value or lack of industrial applications.</p>
<p>Culturally, it may hold symbolic value in local traditions or botanical studies, though its role in symbolism remains understudied.</p>
