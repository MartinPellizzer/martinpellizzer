                    <h1>Agrostis cylindracea</h1>
<p>Agrostis cylindracea, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like vegetation and is often found in moist, well-drained soils, such as those in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its persistence in various habitats.</p>
<p>Agrostis cylindracea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a turfgrass species.</p>
