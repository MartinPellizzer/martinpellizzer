                <h1>Acisanthera tetraptera</h1>
<p>Acisanthera tetraptera, commonly known as the four-winged acacia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, featuring a woody stem and compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive four-winged fruits. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets, and the plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Acisanthera tetraptera is often found in savannas and rocky areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acisanthera tetraptera has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stems are cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a pale brown bark that peels in thin layers, and they grow upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with four petal-like sepals and no true petals, and are pale yellow to greenish in color, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera tetraptera is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It thrives in open woodland and savanna habitats, often found in areas with well-drained soils. The plant is commonly associated with dry or semi-arid environments, where it adapts to seasonal rainfall patterns. It is also occasionally found in parts of southern Arabia and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance, it plays a role in local biodiversity and traditional medicine practices.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acisanthera tetraptera was mainly introduced to new environments as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance.</p>
<p>It has been reported in various regions, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The distribution is largely associated with human activities such as horticultural trade and intentional planting. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often escaping cultivation and becoming naturalized in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its spread has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities.</p>
