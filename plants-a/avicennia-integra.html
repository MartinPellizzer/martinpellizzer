<p>Avicennia integra, commonly known as black mangrove, is a halophytic shrub that thrives in coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive prop roots that aid in stabilizing the soil and facilitating gas exchange. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in saline conditions. It produces yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits that disperse seeds via water.</p>
<p>Avicennia integra plays a crucial role in preventing coastal erosion and supporting diverse marine and terrestrial ecosystems.</p>
