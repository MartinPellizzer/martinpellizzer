                    <h1>Adenium arboreum</h1>
<p>Adenium arboreum, commonly known as the Desert Trumpet, is a striking plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped trunk and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom at the base of the trunk, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Adenium arboreum is also known for its toxic sap, which contains cardioactive compounds used in traditional medicine.</p>
