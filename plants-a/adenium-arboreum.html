                <h1>Adenium arboreum</h1>
<p>Adenium arboreum, commonly known as the Desert Trumpet, is a striking plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped trunk and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom at the base of the trunk, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Adenium arboreum is also known for its toxic sap, which contains cardioactive compounds used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenium arboreum has leaves that are thick, fleshy, and elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a waxy texture.</p>
<p>Its stem is thick and swollen at the base, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically greyish-brown in color, and it grows in a shrub-like or tree-like form. The flowers are large, showy, and trumpet-shaped, with a deep pink to red color, blooming during the dry season, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and strong, adapted to store water and nutrients in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenium arboreum is primarily native to the dry regions of East Africa, including countries such as Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Kenya.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in Yemen and Oman. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It is commonly found in savannas and along riverbanks in its native range.</p>
<p>Adenium arboreum is well adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenium arboreum was mainly introduced to the Arabian Peninsula and parts of Africa for its ornamental value and traditional uses.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and resilience. The plant has also been introduced to regions outside its native range, such as parts of Southeast Asia and the Mediterranean, for horticultural purposes. However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, Adenium arboreum requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
