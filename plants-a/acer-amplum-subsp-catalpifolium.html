<p>Acer amplum subsp.</p>
<p>catalpifolium, commonly known as the Catalpa-leaved maple, is a rare and distinctive subspecies native to parts of eastern Europe. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of the catalpa tree, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and appear in clusters, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
