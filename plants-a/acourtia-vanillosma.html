                <h1>Acourtia vanillosma</h1>
<p>Acourtia vanillosma, commonly known as the vanilla acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its small, yellow flowers are often overlooked, but they play a vital role in pollination by attracting various insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acourtia vanillosma has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright, often branching near the base. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white to pale yellow petals and a tubular structure, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to dry conditions by anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia vanillosma is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal and inland regions of southern California, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area and the Central Coast. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with coastal dunes and scrub habitats. It is also present in parts of Baja California, Mexico.</p>
<p>Acourtia vanillosma is a rare and endemic species, with a limited geographic range and specific ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acourtia vanillosma was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often associated with human activities.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments where competition from native vegetation is reduced. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas, roadsides, and disturbed urban landscapes. Its introduction has led to its spread across various regions, sometimes displacing native flora.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in many parts of its introduced range.</p>
