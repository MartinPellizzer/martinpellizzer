                    <h1>Achyrophorus balbisii</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus balbisii, commonly known as the Balbisii orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a complex root system adapted to its arid and rocky habitat, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It is pollinated primarily by moths, which are attracted to its strong fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
