                    <h1>Alseuosmia ilex</h1>
<p>Alseuosmia ilex, commonly known as the fragrant mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or pale green flowers. The plant secretes a sticky substance that helps it attach to its host and absorb nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its unique ecological role as both a parasite and a potential food source for certain insect species makes it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
