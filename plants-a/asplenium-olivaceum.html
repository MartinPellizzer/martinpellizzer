<p>Asplenium olivaceum, commonly known as the olive spleenwort, is a species of fern native to parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a compact rosette of dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups.</p>
<p>Asplenium olivaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.</p>
