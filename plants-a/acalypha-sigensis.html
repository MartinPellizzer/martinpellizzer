                        <h1>Acalypha sigensis</h1>
<p>Acalypha sigensis, commonly known as the red-veined nettle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive foliage with red veins contrasting against dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Acalypha sigensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha sigensis is primarily native to the island of Siquijor in the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests and moist lowland areas of this region. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. It is commonly seen in shaded undergrowth near streams and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha sigensis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It was first documented in the early 20th century and has since become naturalized in several regions. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned lots. Its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it has established itself.</p>
