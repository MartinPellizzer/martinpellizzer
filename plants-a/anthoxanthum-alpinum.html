<p>Anthoxanthum alpinum, commonly known as alpine yellow grass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and bright yellow inflorescences that distinguish it from other grasses. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers.</p>
<p>Anthoxanthum alpinum plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra regions.</p>
