                    <h1>Anginon streyi</h1>
<p>Anginon streyi, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a unique, orchid-like appearance. Its roots are specialized to absorb nutrients from the surrounding environment, and it thrives in humid, shaded conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Anginon streyi is considered a conservation concern.</p>
