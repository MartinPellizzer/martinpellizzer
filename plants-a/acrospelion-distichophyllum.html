                <h1>Acrospelion distichophyllum</h1>
<p>Acrospelion distichophyllum, commonly known as the two-leaf rock cress, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of two leaves emerging from the base of the plant. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrospelion distichophyllum has simple, opposite leaves that are lanceolate in shape, dark green in color, and range from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light green bark that remains thin throughout the plant's growth. It produces small, white flowers with four petals, blooming in early spring, and is pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrospelion distichophyllum is primarily native to Albania, Austria, France, Germany, Italy, the Northwestern Balkan Peninsula, and Switzerland.</p>
<p>This plant is found in specific regions within these countries, often in alpine or subalpine environments. It thrives in rocky and mountainous terrain, where it benefits from the cooler and more humid conditions. The distribution of Acrospelion distichophyllum is closely tied to its ecological requirements, limiting its presence to these particular geographic areas.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its adaptation to the climatic and geological conditions of these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrospelion distichophyllum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as landscaping and horticultural trade.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments where it thrives in well-drained conditions. This plant has a low-growing, mat-forming structure, which allows it to spread efficiently across open areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain regions.</p>
<p>However, it is currently considered a non-native species with limited ecological impact in most areas.</p>
