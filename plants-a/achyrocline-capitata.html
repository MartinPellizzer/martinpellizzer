                <h1>Achyrocline capitata</h1>
<p>Achyrocline capitata, commonly known as the Cape hibiscus, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to salty, well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered with fine hairs.</p>
<p>The flowers are borne in dense, terminal clusters called capitula, which give the plant its scientific name.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrocline capitata has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, somewhat woody, and has a smooth, grayish-brown bark. Its flowers are small, clustered in compact heads, with white to pale blue petals that bloom during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline capitata is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles.</p>
<p>It is also found in Central America, particularly in countries such as Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and dry forests. It is commonly associated with sandy soils and is sometimes found in disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Its native distribution includes islands like Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrocline capitata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activities such as agriculture and land clearing.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun exposure and well-drained soils, making it a common weed in disturbed ecosystems. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas quickly, which contributes to its invasive potential in some regions. It is also tolerant of a wide range of environmental conditions, allowing it to spread across different geographical zones.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, Achyrocline capitata is often found in coastal areas, roadsides, and abandoned fields.</p>
