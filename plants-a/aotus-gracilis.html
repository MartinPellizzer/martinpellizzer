<p>Aotus gracilis, commonly known as the slender owl monkey, is a species of primate found in the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is not a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects. If you were referring to a plant, please provide the correct name. For now, I cannot provide information on its botanical characteristics.</p>
