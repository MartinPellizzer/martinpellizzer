<p>Acrothamnus hookeri, commonly known as Hooker's acrothamnus, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes plants known for their aromatic properties. The plant features small, spiny leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It is typically found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Acrothamnus hookeri is often used in local landscapes for its hardy nature and ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrothamnus hookeri has leaves that are lanceolate, alternate, and typically range from 3 to 8 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a rough, fissured bark that is generally grayish-brown in color. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in terminal inflorescences, blooming from late winter to early spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in moisture retention and stabilizing the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrothamnus hookeri is a low-growing shrub native to southern Australia, specifically found in Western Australia and South Australia.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes coastal and inland regions, particularly in the southern parts of these states. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils in open habitats such as woodlands, heathlands, and coastal dunes. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to approximately 500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Acrothamnus hookeri is classified as vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acrothamnus hookeri is a hardy, flowering shrub native to Australia, known for its adaptability and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or stem cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. This plant has a winter-dormant growth cycle, thriving in mild, temperate climates.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilization should be minimal, with light feeding in spring, and pruning is recommended to maintain shape and encourage flowering. It is generally pest and disease-resistant but may attract aphids or leaf spot in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with drought-tolerant species like lavender or sedum can enhance its growth and aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acrothamnus hookeri is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various native wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its small, clustered flowers. The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its dense growth helps with erosion control, stabilizing soil in coastal and sandy environments.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to habitat diversity, offering refuge and nesting sites for small animals.</p>
