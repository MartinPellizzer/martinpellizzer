                <h1>Acrothamnus hookeri</h1>
<p>Acrothamnus hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's acrothamnus, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its erect, spindly growth habit. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of pink or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrothamnus hookeri has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically brown in color, and it grows in a sprawling or shrub-like pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with yellow petals and a green calyx, blooming from late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrothamnus hookeri is primarily native to Tasmania.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal and subcoastal regions of the state. This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shores. It is well adapted to the temperate and maritime climate of Tasmania.</p>
<p>Acrothamnus hookeri is often seen in open habitats such as dunes and rocky outcrops.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrothamnus hookeri was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silver foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is highly adaptable to different environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have made it a concern for local ecosystems.</p>
