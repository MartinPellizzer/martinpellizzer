                    <h1>Ammophila arenaria</h1>
<p>Ammophila arenaria, commonly known as the European beachgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to sandy soils and salt spray, making it a pioneer species in dune stabilization. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its extensive root system helps bind sand together, preventing erosion.</p>
<p>It plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
