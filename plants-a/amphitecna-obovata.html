<p>Amphitecna obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, ovate-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous roots, allowing it to establish itself in various soil types.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
