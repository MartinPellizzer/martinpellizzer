                    <h1>Aristolochia cobra</h1>
<p>Aristolochia cobra, commonly known as the cobra lily, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, hooded flowers that resemble a cobra's head, which is a key feature in its common name. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and emits a strong, often unpleasant odor to attract its pollinators. Its vines can grow quite long, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>However, it is toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of aristolochic acids in its tissues.</p>
