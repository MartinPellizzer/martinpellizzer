                <h1>Acrocephalus viridulus</h1>
<p>Acrocephalus viridulus, commonly known as the green-headed twayblade, is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, spike-like inflorescence that bears greenish-yellow flowers. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrocephalus viridulus has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a bright green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a slightly rough texture, and it grows upright, often forming dense clumps. Its flowers are small, greenish-white blooms arranged in spike-like inflorescences, blooming in early summer, and are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in wet or moist soil environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocephalus viridulus is primarily native to southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in Mediterranean regions, including countries such as Spain, Italy, Greece, and Turkey. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often associated with coastal areas and inland scrublands. It is also present in parts of North Africa, including Morocco and Algeria.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the Mediterranean climate, where it grows in open, sunny habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrocephalus viridulus was mainly introduced to areas with moist soils and open habitats, such as wetlands, marshes, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in temperate regions where it thrives in wet or semi-wet environments. The plant has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. Its spread is often associated with human activities, such as the creation of wetland habitats or accidental transport through water or soil.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
