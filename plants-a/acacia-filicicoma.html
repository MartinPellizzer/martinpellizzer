                        <h1>Acacia filicicoma</h1>
<p>Acacia filicicoma, commonly known as the fern-leaf acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often mistaken for ferns due to their delicate, feather-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, globular clusters, followed by flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems and waxy leaves that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Acacia filicicoma is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock.</p>
