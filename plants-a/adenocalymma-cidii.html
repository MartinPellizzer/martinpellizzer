                <h1>Adenocalymma cidii</h1>
<p>Adenocalymma cidii, commonly known as the red-flowered adenocalymma, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its striking red flowers, which are typically tubular and arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma cidii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma cidii has leaves that are simple, elliptical in shape, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that grows upright. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the spring and early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in its native soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma cidii is primarily native to Brazil North and Peru.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in the tropical regions of these countries. It thrives in humid and warm climates, often growing in forested areas. Adenocalymma cidii is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its native habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these regions due to its particular environmental requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma cidii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soil conditions. This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range, often spreading through seed dispersal by wind and animals.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
