                <h1>Acilepis cirsiifolia</h1>
<p>Acilepis cirsiifolia, commonly known as the woollyleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and savanna habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acilepis cirsiifolia has compound leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a serrated margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 5 to 15 cm in length, exhibiting a dark green color with a slight pubescence.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a creeping or ascending manner. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with tubular corollas and five lobes, displaying a yellowish-green color, blooming in early spring, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid environments by anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis cirsiifolia is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in rocky and arid environments, such as cliffs, slopes, and wastelands. The plant thrives in areas with mild, dry summers and cool, wet winters. It is often associated with limestone soils and can be found in both coastal and inland regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in similar climates.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acilepis cirsiifolia was mainly introduced to control weed growth in agricultural fields and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used as a biocontrol agent due to its ability to suppress competitive weeds. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its introduction has been documented in several regions, including parts of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in native ecosystems.</p>
