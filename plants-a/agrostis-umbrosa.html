                    <h1>Agrostis umbrosa</h1>
<p>Agrostis umbrosa, commonly known as the shade grass or dark grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets.</p>
<p>Agrostis umbrosa is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
