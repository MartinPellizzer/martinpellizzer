                <h1>Acer pictum</h1>
<p>Acer pictum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red leaves that turn brilliant orange, yellow, and red in the fall. The tree has a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes furrowed with age. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and appear in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring.</p>
<p>Acer pictum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forests and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer pictum has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically bright green in summer and turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. The stem is slender with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows in a straight, upright manner.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer pictum is a small deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, primarily found in the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia, though it is now rare. It thrives in moist, acidic soils in shaded to partially sunny environments, often in mixed hardwood forests. Acer pictum grows at elevations ranging from 300 to 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, it is listed as endangered in some states and is considered a species of concern for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer pictum is a decorative maple tree known for its vibrant autumn foliage and ornamental value.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer pictum involves a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shrubs like hydrangeas or perennials can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>
