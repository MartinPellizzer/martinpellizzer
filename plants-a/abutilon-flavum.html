                <h1>Abutilon flavum</h1>
<p>Abutilon flavum, commonly known as the yellow abutilon, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1â€“3 meters. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its bark is smooth and grayish in appearance.</p>
<p>Abutilon flavum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon flavum has simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, somewhat hairy, and has a pale green to brownish bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are showy, with five petals that are yellow to orange in color, and they bloom in summer, relying on insect pollination, particularly by bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon flavum is a flowering plant native to the western United States, specifically found in California and parts of Nevada.</p>
<p>While it was once more widespread, its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in the Mojave Desert region. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, typically growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds.</p>
<p>Abutilon flavum is found at elevations ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level. Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is listed as endangered by the U.S.</p>
<p>Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon flavum is a striking, fast-growing shrub known for its vibrant yellow flowers and velvety foliage, commonly cultivated in warm climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, stem cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining desirable traits. This plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, but it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings.</p>
<p>Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth, while pruning after flowering encourages bushier growth and prevents legginess. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with appropriate organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance the garden's aesthetic.</p>
