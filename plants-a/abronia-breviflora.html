<p>Abronia breviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal and inland desert regions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
