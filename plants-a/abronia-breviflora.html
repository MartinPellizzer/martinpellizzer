                        <h1>Abronia breviflora</h1>
<p>Abronia breviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal and inland desert regions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Abronia breviflora is adapted to full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia breviflora is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils along the Pacific coast. This plant thrives in dune environments and is often associated with maritime climates. It is part of the flowering plant family Montiaceae and is known for its small, delicate flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abronia breviflora was mainly introduced to coastal dunes and sandy soils in the western United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, sunny environments with minimal water retention. The plant is known for its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. It is often found in association with other coastal flora such as beach grasses and dune shrubs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
