                        <h1>Acer platanoides f. columnare</h1>
<p>Acer platanoides f. columnare, commonly known as the columnar Norway maple, is a unique variant of the Norway maple characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit.</p>
<p>This form exhibits a dense, compact structure, making it suitable for small spaces or as a specimen plant. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a serrated margin, and they turn vibrant shades of yellow and red in the fall. It produces small, inconspicuous green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras.</p>
<p>While it retains the ornamental qualities of its parent species, its columnar shape offers a distinct aesthetic in landscape design.</p>
