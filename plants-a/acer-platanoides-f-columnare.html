<p>Acer platanoides f. columnare, commonly known as the columnar Norway maple, is a cultivar characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit.</p>
<p>It features dark green, ovate leaves with serrated edges that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as fruits. It is often used in landscaping for its compact form and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and resistance to urban conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer platanoides f. columnare has narrowly elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to support the plant's upright growth habit.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer platanoides f. columnare is a horticultural form of the European maple, originally native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>While it is not found in the wild, it has been widely cultivated in temperate climates around the world.
