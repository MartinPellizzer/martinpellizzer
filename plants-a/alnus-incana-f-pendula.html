<p>Alnus incana f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping alder, is a shrub or small tree native to northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pendulous branches that droop gracefully, giving it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color and are arranged alternately along the stems. It produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, cone-like female flowers, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils near water sources such as streams and wetlands.</p>
