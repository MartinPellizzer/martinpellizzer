                    <h1>Aegilops macrura</h1>
<p>Aegilops macrura, commonly known as the large-seeded wild wheat, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing several small, awned florets. Aegilops macrura is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>It has been studied for its potential role in wheat genetics and as a source of genetic diversity for crop improvement.</p>
