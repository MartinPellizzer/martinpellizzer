                <h1>Aegilops macrura</h1>
<p>Aegilops macrura, commonly known as the large-seeded wild wheat, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing several small, awned florets. Aegilops macrura is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>It has been studied for its potential role in wheat genetics and as a source of genetic diversity for crop improvement.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops macrura has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically linear in shape, arranged in a basal rosette, and have a bluish-green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and smooth, with a light green color, and grows from the base of the plant. Its flowers are spike-like inflorescences with small, pale blue to white florets, blooming in early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-angled spikelet that disperses its seeds by wind due to the bracts that aid in their release.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soils.</p>
