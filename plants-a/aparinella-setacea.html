<p>Aparinella setacea, commonly known as the hairy aparinella, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its native arid environment. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in a fluffy, cotton-like capsule, which aids in seed dispersal by wind.</p>
