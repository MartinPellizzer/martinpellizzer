                <h1>Acianthera nikoleae</h1>
<p>Acianthera nikoleae, commonly known as Nikolea's orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a compact growth habit with fleshy roots adapted to its humid, shaded forest habitat. Its floral structure includes specialized pollination mechanisms, making it an important subject in botanical and ecological studies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera nikoleae has leaves that are ovate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a light green bark that is smooth and slightly hairy. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and a yellowish lip, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in rocky or dry environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera nikoleae is primarily native to Ecuador.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the cloud forests of the western Andes in Ecuador. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes. The plant is known for its delicate, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>Its native range is limited to specific regions within Ecuador's biodiversity-rich ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera nikoleae was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in environments with high light exposure and moderate to high humidity levels. This plant is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. It has been reported in several countries in South America and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>However, its introduction outside its native range has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems.</p>
