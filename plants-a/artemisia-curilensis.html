<p>Artemisia curilensis, commonly known as Siberian wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and aromatic, glandular leaves that emit a strong, camphor-like scent. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Artemisia curilensis has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its purported medicinal properties.</p>
