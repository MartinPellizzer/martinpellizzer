                <h1>Adenostegia kingii</h1>
<p>Adenostegia kingii, commonly known as the King's adenostegia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Adenostegia kingii produces small yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostegia kingii has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth texture, typically ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds through wind dispersal, and the seeds are tiny, dry, and winged for easy transport.</p>
<p>The root system is shallow and fibrous, helping the plant anchor in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostegia kingii is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and parts of Nevada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in chaparral and scrub habitats, often in areas with rocky soils and mild climates. This plant thrives in regions characterized by dry summers and wet winters, typical of the Mediterranean climate. It is particularly associated with the coastal and inland valleys of California.</p>
<p>Adenostegia kingii is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostegia kingii was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and sandy environments where it forms dense vegetation. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand harsh climatic conditions. However, its rapid growth has led to its classification as an invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Despite its ecological benefits, it can outcompete native plants and alter local ecosystems.</p>
