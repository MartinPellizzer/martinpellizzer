                <h1>Adhatoda pilosa</h1>
<p>Adhatoda pilosa, commonly known as the Indian skullcap, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from summer to autumn. Its medicinal properties have been recognized in traditional African medicine for treating respiratory and digestive ailments.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adhatoda pilosa has leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, with a smooth texture and a dark green color on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside; they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, reddish-brown bark that becomes darker with age, and it grows upright with some branching. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with a pinkish-white color, blooming during the rainy season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda pilosa is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, marshy areas, and along riverbanks where it thrives in moist environments. This plant is also present in parts of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. It is often used in traditional medicine for its medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Its native distribution reflects its adaptability to humid and water-rich habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adhatoda pilosa was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and as a medicinal plant due to its traditional uses in treating respiratory ailments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and waste lands where it thrives in poor soils. The plant is native to Africa but has been introduced to parts of Asia and the Americas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both useful and potentially invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact varies depending on the region and management practices.</p>
