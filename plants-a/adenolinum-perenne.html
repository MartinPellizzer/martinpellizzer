                <h1>Adenolinum perenne</h1>
<p>Adenolinum perenne, commonly known as the evergreen lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Adenolinum perenne is also valued for its resilience to drought and mild frosts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenolinum perenne has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range from 5 to 10 cm in length, with a dark green, glossy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and grows upright, with a light green bark that becomes woody with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenolinum perenne is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including southern Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and coastal areas, often found along cliffs and in dry, sunny environments. This plant is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat, such as high salinity and low water availability. It is commonly seen in regions like Spain, Italy, and the eastern coast of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to the specific microclimates and soil types found in these areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenolinum perenne was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation.</p>
<p>It was first brought to the country in the early 20th century by horticulturists seeking to diversify the local plant palette. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become a potential invasive species, spreading beyond cultivated gardens into natural ecosystems. Its rapid growth and adaptability have raised concerns among conservationists.</p>
<p>Efforts are now underway to monitor and control its spread to protect native biodiversity.</p>
