<p>Arachnorchis infundibularis, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a single, showy flower that has a distinctive hood-like structure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the base.</p>
<p>The orchid relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common characteristic among orchid species.</p>
