<p>Althaea calvertii, commonly known as the Maryland marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and showy pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its roots produce a mucilaginous substance, which has been historically used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Althaea calvertii is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing wetland habitats.</p>
