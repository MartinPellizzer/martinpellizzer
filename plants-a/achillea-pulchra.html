                <h1>Achillea pulchra</h1>
<p>Achillea pulchra, commonly known as the showy yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. Its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Achillea pulchra is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pulchra has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, with a bluish-gray color and a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and has a smooth, light green to reddish-brown bark. Its flowers are composite, consisting of white ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pulchra is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America, specifically found in parts of California and Nevada.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas within the Sierra Nevada and the Great Basin, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. This species typically grows in open woodlands, grasslands, and slopes, often in well-drained soils. It is commonly found at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea pulchra is listed as a species of concern in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea pulchra is a striking perennial plant known for its vibrant, daisy-like flowers and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seed sowing or by dividing established clumps, with the best results achieved in early spring or fall. This plant has a summer blooming cycle, producing flowers from late spring to early summer, followed by a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, with care to avoid overwatering. Fertilization should be light in early spring, and pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and promote new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or rust, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow can enhance its growth and deter pests naturally.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea pulchra is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and beneficial insects, which contribute to the overall biodiversity of the ecosystem. This plant acts as a companion plant, often growing alongside other native species to enhance soil health and support a diverse plant community. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Additionally, Achillea pulchra offers ecological benefits by improving soil structure and supporting a range of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea pulchra is a flowering plant native to the western United States, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
