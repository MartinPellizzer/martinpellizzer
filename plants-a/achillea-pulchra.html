                <h1>Achillea pulchra</h1>
<p>Achillea pulchra, commonly known as the showy yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across rugged terrain.</p>
<p>Achillea pulchra is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea pulchra has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, with a grayish-green color and a fuzzy texture, arranged in a rosette pattern and ranging in size from 5 to 15 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, greenish-gray bark, and grows from the base of the plant, forming a compact, low-growing shrub. Its flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. The plant produces small, oval fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight nature.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and deep-penetrating, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb water from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pulchra is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, including grasslands, chaparral, and open woodlands. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in sunny habitats. It is also known to occur in parts of Oregon and Nevada.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into some areas of Baja California, Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea pulchra was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. The plant has since spread beyond cultivation and is now considered invasive in some areas. It thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species have raised concerns about its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
