<p>It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white, lantern-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy inflorescences.</p>
<p>Abutilon albescens prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes in warm climates.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon albescens has simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dull green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly woody with age, and it grows upright with some branching. The flowers are pendulous, bell-shaped, and typically white or pale yellow, blooming in spring to early summer, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon albescens is a flowering plant native to the western United States, specifically found in California and parts of Nevada.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes areas along the Pacific coast and inland valleys, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. This species prefers arid or semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils or along streambanks. It is typically found at elevations ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Abutilon albescens is listed as a threatened species due to habitat loss and limited range, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon albescens is a flowering plant known for its delicate, white blooms and fuzzy, heart-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or stem cuttings, with cuttings being the more reliable method for maintaining the plant's genetic traits. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, often blooming within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires consistent watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to encourage bushier growth are essential for its health.
