                <h1>Acer fabri</h1>
<p>Acer fabri, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10–20 meters and is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types.</p>
<p>Acer fabri is often cultivated in gardens and urban landscapes for its aesthetic value and seasonal color changes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer fabri has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin and a pointed tip, typically measuring 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, turning yellow in the autumn. The stem is smooth and light brown, with a straight growth pattern, and the bark is thin and peels in small, flaky pieces. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer fabri is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>While it was historically found in these areas, its current distribution is limited and fragmented due to habitat loss and environmental changes. It thrives in temperate climates with moist, well-drained soils, typically found in mixed forests. This species grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and threats from deforestation, Acer fabri is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer fabri is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value, featuring vibrant autumn foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer fabri involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to shape the tree and remove diseased branches are essential for healthy growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving perennials or shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer fabri is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers and serves as a valuable food source for herbivores. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its deep roots help in erosion control by holding soil in place during heavy rains.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer fabri contributes to carbon sequestration and improves air quality through photosynthesis.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer fabri is a species of maple tree known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and seeds may have minor uses in traditional practices. In medicinal contexts, it has been explored for potential anti-inflammatory properties, though research is limited. Industrially, its wood is valued for its strength and fine grain, making it suitable for furniture and carpentry.</p>
<p>Culturally, it is often appreciated for its aesthetic appeal in landscaping and as a symbol of resilience in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer fabri has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Atrosanguineum' and 'Variegatum', known for their striking foliage colors. Hybrids such as Acer fabri × A. japonicum have been developed to enhance growth habits and seasonal color. These cultivars and hybrids are important in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to different garden conditions.</p>
<p>They are widely used in landscaping and as specimen trees due to their unique features.</p>
