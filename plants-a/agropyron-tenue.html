                    <h1>Agropyron tenue</h1>
<p>Agropyron tenue, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and establish quickly in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Agropyron tenue is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in restoration ecology.</p>
