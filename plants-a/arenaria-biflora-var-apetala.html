                    <h1>Arenaria biflora var. apetala</h1>
<p>Arenaria biflora var. apetala, commonly known as the barren-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers, though the varietal name "apetala" indicates a reduced or absent floral structure compared to the typical species. Its leaves are typically linear and succulent, adapted to conserve water in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in dry, sandy soils and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid regions.</p>
