                <h1>Acer kungshanense</h1>
<p>Acer kungshanense, commonly known as the Kungshan maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It typically grows in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer kungshanense has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that develops shallow fissures as the tree matures. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters during the spring, with yellowish-green petals and a wind pollination method. The fruit is a samara, consisting of a winged seed enclosed in a thin, papery covering, which is dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the rocky, well-drained soils of its mountainous habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer kungshanense is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of central China, particularly in the Hengduan Mountains.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically found in mixed forests. This species grows at altitudes between 2,000 and 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat loss, Acer kungshanense is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer kungshanense is a rare maple species native to China, known for its ornamental value and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-ripe cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle includes a period of active growth in spring and summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring and light pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches is recommended. It is relatively pest and disease resistant, though aphids and scale insects may occasionally infest it.</p>
<p>Companion planting with shade-loving perennials or shrubs can enhance its growth in a garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer kungshanense is a deciduous tree native to China that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy yellow flowers, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil structure and supporting other plant species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer kungshanense plays a role in carbon sequestration, offering long-term ecological benefits to its environment.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer kungshanense is a rare and endemic tree species native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance in its native habitat.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its wood is sometimes utilized for small-scale crafts and furniture due to its fine grain and durability. In traditional Chinese medicine, parts of the plant have been used to treat various ailments, although scientific validation of these uses is limited. The tree holds cultural significance in local communities, often symbolizing resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, Acer kungshanense plays a vital role in maintaining biodiversity and ecological balance in its region.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer kungshanense has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are valued for their ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Lacey' and 'Variegatum', which are known for their striking foliage colors and unique leaf patterns. Hybrids of Acer kungshanense are often created to enhance traits such as hardiness, growth habit, and color variation. These cultivars and hybrids hold significant horticultural importance due to their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden settings.</p>
<p>They are widely cultivated in landscape design and botanical gardens worldwide.</p>
