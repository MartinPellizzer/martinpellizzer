                <h1>Acer kungshanense</h1>
<p>Acer kungshanense, commonly known as the Kungshan maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, red samaras that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer kungshanense has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a vibrant green color that turns yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, light gray bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, with a simple structure consisting of four petals, and they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its mountainous habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer kungshanense is a rare species of maple native to China, specifically found in the mountainous regions of Sichuan and Hubei provinces.</p>
<p>It is currently distributed in limited areas within these regions, primarily in the higher elevations of the Yangtze River Basin. This plant thrives in moist, temperate forests with well-drained soil, often growing in shaded understory conditions. It is typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Acer kungshanense is listed as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer kungshanense is a deciduous tree native to China, known for its ornamental value and unique foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood are essential for healthy growth.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot, and it pairs well with other shade-tolerant plants in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer kungshanense is a deciduous tree native to China that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. It also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system that anchors the soil.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer kungshanense supports ecological balance by offering habitat and resources to a wide range of organisms.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer kungshanense is a rare and ornamental tree native to China, primarily valued for its aesthetic appeal in horticulture and landscape design.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties, though research remains limited. The tree contributes to local ecosystems by providing habitat and supporting biodiversity, though it has limited industrial or economic significance. Culturally, it is sometimes appreciated for its unique appearance and may hold symbolic meaning in regional traditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, conservation efforts are crucial to preserving its ecological and potential future roles.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer kungshanense has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are of interest in horticulture.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson Queen' and 'Sutherlandii', known for their striking autumn foliage and ornamental value. Hybrid forms have been developed to enhance traits such as hardiness, growth habit, and color display. These hybrids are particularly valued for their ability to thrive in a range of climates and soil conditions.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer kungshanense holds significant horticultural importance due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability in landscape design.</p>
