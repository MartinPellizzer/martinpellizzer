                        <h1>Abies medioxima</h1>
<p>Abies medioxima, commonly known as the Mexican fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its conical shape, dark green needle-like leaves, and distinctive cones that hang downward. The tree thrives in temperate climates with high elevation and well-drained soils. Its bark is typically reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>Abies medioxima plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies medioxima is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, specifically China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the temperate forests of these areas, growing at high altitudes. This species thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with mixed coniferous and broadleaf forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies medioxima was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental tree due to its attractive conical shape and evergreen foliage.</p>
<p>It has been cultivated in gardens and landscaped areas across the United States and Canada. Despite its aesthetic value, it has shown limited naturalization and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems. Its introduction has primarily occurred through horticultural trade rather than natural dispersal.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive in its introduced range.</p>
