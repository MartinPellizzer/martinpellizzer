                    <h1>Agrostis exarata var. stolonifera</h1>
<p>Agrostis exarata var. stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form thick, uniform turf. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, golf courses, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its adaptability and resilience make it a popular choice for landscaping and turfgrass applications.</p>
