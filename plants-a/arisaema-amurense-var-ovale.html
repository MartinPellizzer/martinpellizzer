                    <h1>Arisaema amurense var. ovale</h1>
<p>Arisaema amurense var. ovale, commonly known as the Chinese arrowroot or umbrella plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features a short, rhizomatous stem and distinctive, umbrella-like inflorescences composed of a spadix enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>However, caution is necessary as all parts of the plant contain calcium oxalate crystals, which can cause irritation upon contact or ingestion.</p>
