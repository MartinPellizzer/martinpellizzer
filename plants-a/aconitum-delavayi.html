                    <h1>Aconitum delavayi</h1>
<p>Aconitum delavayi, commonly known as Delavay's aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces toxic alkaloids, particularly aconitine, which makes it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often have a waxy coating, while its roots are thick and fleshy.</p>
<p>Aconitum delavayi is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value, though caution is necessary due to its toxicity.</p>
