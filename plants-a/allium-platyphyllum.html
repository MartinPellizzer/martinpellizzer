                    <h1>Allium platyphyllum</h1>
<p>Allium platyphyllum, commonly known as the flat-leaved onion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features a bulbous base with narrow, flat, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, spherical, pale pink to white flowers during the spring and early summer. Its botanical name reflects its flat leaves ("platy" meaning flat) and its relation to the onion genus ("Allium").</p>
<p>Allium platyphyllum is often used in Mediterranean gardens for its ornamental value and mild onion-like scent.</p>
