                <h1>Achyronia angustissima</h1>
<p>Achyronia angustissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf achyronia, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to greenish-white, with five petals and a prominent central stamen.</p>
<p>Achyronia angustissima is often found in moist, open habitats such as swamps and wet meadows.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyronia angustissima has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically linear to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length with a dark green coloration.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that remains relatively unchanged as the plant matures. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, featuring pale yellow petals and stamens, and bloom during the spring season, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The root system is fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's preference for well-drained soils in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia angustissima is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Sonora and Sinaloa. This plant typically grows in rocky soils and dry environments. It is commonly associated with desert and semi-arid habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these geographic areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyronia angustissima was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas with moist, acidic soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant has been reported in several states including Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. Its introduction is often associated with human activities such as land development and the alteration of natural water systems.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
