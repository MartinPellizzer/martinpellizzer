                <h1>Adriana hookeri</h1>
<p>Adriana hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's adriana, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flower clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and thrives in full sun. Its small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Adriana hookeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adriana hookeri has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and range in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, covered in a rough, grayish-brown bark, and exhibits an upright growth pattern with branches that spread outward. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, featuring a tubular structure and blooming during the spring season, primarily pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a small capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight, hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adriana hookeri is primarily native to the southern regions of South America, specifically Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the coastal areas and valleys of these countries. This plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with rocky or sandy substrates in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adriana hookeri was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It has been documented in Washington and Oregon, where it has established populations in moist, shaded environments. This plant is often found in forested areas with rich, organic soil. Its introduction is believed to be due to natural dispersal from nearby native populations or human-assisted spread.</p>
<p>Despite being non-native, it has not become invasive and is considered a rare ornamental species.</p>
