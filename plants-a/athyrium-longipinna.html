                    <h1>Athyrium longipinna</h1>
<p>Athyrium longipinna, commonly known as the long-pinnate fern, is a species native to East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous fern characterized by its tall, slender stalks and large, lance-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, emitting a soft blue glow due to the presence of luciferin and luciferyl alcohol.</p>
<p>This unique trait makes it a rare and fascinating example of bioluminescence in the plant kingdom.</p>
