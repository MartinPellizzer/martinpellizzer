                    <h1>Adelia cinerea</h1>
<p>Adelia cinerea, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Adelia cinerea is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
