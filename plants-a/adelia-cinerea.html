                <h1>Adelia cinerea</h1>
<p>Adelia cinerea, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Adelia cinerea is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adelia cinerea has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a pale green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and woody, with a grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and it grows in a spreading, shrub-like pattern. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia cinerea is primarily native to Mexico Northwest.</p>
<p>It is found in the northern regions of Mexico, particularly in the states of Chihuahua, Durango, and Zacatecas. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It is commonly associated with scrublands and grasslands in these regions.</p>
<p>The species is well adapted to the dry climate and limited water availability of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adelia cinerea was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in sandy soils along the shores of New South Wales and Victoria. This plant has adapted well to the harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It is often seen growing in dunes and on rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its introduction has led to its establishment in several natural habitats, though it is not considered invasive.</p>
