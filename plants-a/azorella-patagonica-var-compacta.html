<p>Azorella patagonica var. compacta, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the short growing season. Its leaves are tightly packed and covered in a thick layer of fine, white hairs, which provide insulation and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Azorella patagonica var. compacta is adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species found in alpine and subantarctic regions.</p>
