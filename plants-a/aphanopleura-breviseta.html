<p>Aphanopleura breviseta, commonly known as the short-hairless bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, branched stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. This plant is typically found in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. It lacks true leaves and instead has specialized structures called bladders for capturing prey.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in ecological studies due to its role in aquatic food webs.</p>
