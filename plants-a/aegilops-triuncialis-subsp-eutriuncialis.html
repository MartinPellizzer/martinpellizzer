<p>Aegilops triuncialis subsp.</p>
<p>eutriuncialis, commonly known as the slender wild wheat, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields, where it can act as a weed.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to researchers due to its potential role in wheat evolution and genetic diversity.</p>
