<p>Atriplex smithii, commonly known as Smith's saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in saline soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Atriplex smithii plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
