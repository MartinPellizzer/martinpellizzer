<p>Angraecum conchiferum, commonly known as the sacred violet, is a climbing orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and striking, fragrant white flowers with long, narrow petals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Angraecum conchiferum is known for its nocturnal blooming habit, often opening its flowers at night.</p>
<p>This species is also notable for its historical significance in the development of Darwin's theory of natural selection.</p>
