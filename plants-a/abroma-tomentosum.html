                <h1>Abroma tomentosum</h1>
<p>Abroma tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly abroma, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter. The plant features soft, hairy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. Its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers are usually pink or white and bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>Abroma tomentosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and blooms.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abroma tomentosum has ovate to elliptic leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, covered in fine white hairs, and has a light green to grayish color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are clustered in terminal spikes, featuring five pinkish-white petals and a yellow center, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a spherical capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and spread out underground, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abroma tomentosum is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It is now also found in parts of Asia, including India and Sri Lanka, as well as in the Caribbean and some Pacific islands. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands, savannas, and along riverbanks. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Abroma tomentosum is currently listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN, although its populations are threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting in some regions.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abroma tomentosum is a tropical shrub known for its ornamental value and easy cultivation.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through stem cuttings or seeds, with cuttings being the most reliable method for faster growth. The plant has a rapid growth cycle, thriving in warm climates and blooming throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>It prefers well-draining soil and regular watering, but it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer during the growing season promotes healthy growth, while pruning helps maintain its shape and encourages flowering. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or spider mites, which can be managed with insecticidal soap.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or basil can help deter pests and improve the plant's overall health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Abroma tomentosum is a shrub that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. It acts as a companion plant in coastal landscapes, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Additionally, its dense growth offers protection and nesting sites for birds and insects.</p>
<p>This plant also supports biodiversity by creating microhabitats that sustain a wide range of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Abroma tomentosum is a versatile plant known for its various uses and applications across different fields.</p>
<p>In culinary contexts, its leaves are sometimes used as a vegetable in traditional dishes, especially in parts of Southeast Asia.
