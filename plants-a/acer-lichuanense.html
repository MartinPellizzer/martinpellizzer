                <h1>Acer lichuanense</h1>
<p>Acer lichuanense, commonly known as the Lichuan maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red to orange samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape tree.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer lichuanense has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length and a dark green color on the upper surface, turning red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a small to medium-sized tree with a spreading crown. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, with a simple structure consisting of four petals, and it is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and light.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, helping the plant anchor in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer lichuanense is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of southern China, specifically in the provinces of Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few fragmented populations in the Lichuan and Xiangxiang areas. It thrives in humid, temperate environments with well-drained soils, often found in mixed forests. The plant typically grows at altitudes between 800 and 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited range, Acer lichuanense is listed as endangered, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer lichuanense is a unique maple species native to China, known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The plant has a moderate growth cycle, reaching maturity in 5â€“10 years, and thrives in temperate climates with full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, loamy soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, but should not be overwatered. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or powdery mildew in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or marigold can help repel pests and improve garden aesthetics.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer lichuanense is a native tree species that provides essential food and shelter for various wildlife species in its habitat.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, which help in the reproduction of the tree and other plants in the ecosystem. The tree acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring vegetation through its shade and nutrient contribution. Its deep root system helps in erosion control by stabilizing soil and preventing runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer lichuanense contributes to carbon sequestration, supporting overall ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer lichuanense is a rare and endemic tree species native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its wood is occasionally utilized in small-scale carpentry and handicrafts due to its fine texture and durability. In traditional Chinese medicine, parts of the plant have been used to treat various ailments, though research on its medicinal properties is limited. The tree also plays a role in cultural and symbolic contexts, representing the unique biodiversity of its native region.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, Acer lichuanense is of great importance for conservation efforts and ecological studies.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer lichuanense has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are of interest in horticulture.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Aureum' and 'Variegatum', which are prized for their striking foliage colors. While natural hybrids of Acer lichuanense are less common, it has been crossed with other maple species to create unique ornamental varieties. These cultivars contribute to the diversity of maple trees in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to their aesthetic value, Acer lichuanense and its hybrids hold significant horticultural importance in the cultivation of ornamental trees.</p>
