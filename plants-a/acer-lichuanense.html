                <h1>Acer lichuanense</h1>
<p>Acer lichuanense, commonly known as the Lichuan maple, is a deciduous tree native to southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red-orange samaras that are typical of the maple genus. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>Acer lichuanense is often found in moist, shaded habitats within mountainous regions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer lichuanense has alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually 5-10 cm long and 3-6 cm wide, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface that turns yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light brown bark that peels in thin, papery strips as the tree matures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences during spring, which are wind-pollinated and have separate male and female flowers on the same tree. The fruit is a samara with two winged seeds, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat in China.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer lichuanense is a rare species native to China, specifically found in the mountainous regions of Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to these areas, where it grows in moist, shaded environments within evergreen forests. It typically thrives at altitudes between 800 and 1,600 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited population size, Acer lichuanense is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer lichuanense is a rare and ornamental maple species native to China, known for its striking red foliage and unique leaf shape.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification to break dormancy and enhance germination rates. The plant has a slow growth cycle, typically reaching maturity over several years, making it suitable for long-term landscaping projects.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, loamy soil and moderate watering, with care to avoid waterlogging during the growing season. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring supports healthy growth, while regular pruning helps maintain its shape and promote air circulation. It is relatively resistant to pests and diseases but can be affected by aphids and powdery mildew, which can be managed with organic treatments.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ornamental grasses or other shrubs can enhance its aesthetic appeal and provide ecological benefits.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer lichuanense is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and insects.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers, contributing to the pollination of other plants in the ecosystem. The tree also acts as a companion plant, enhancing the growth of neighboring species through improved soil conditions. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer lichuanense plays a vital role in maintaining biodiversity and ecological balance in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer lichuanense is a species of maple native to China, known for its ornamental value and ecological importance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves and bark have been explored for potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In industrial and economic contexts, it contributes to local biodiversity and supports wildlife, though it has limited commercial use. Culturally, it is valued in its native regions for its aesthetic appeal and may hold symbolic significance in traditional practices.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer lichuanense plays a role in conservation efforts and ecological balance in its natural habitat.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer lichuanense has several varieties, cultivars, and hybrids that are of interest in horticulture.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Atrosanguineum' and 'Variegatum', which are prized for their unique foliage colors. Hybrids of Acer lichuanense are often created to enhance traits such as cold hardiness and leaf coloration. These plants hold significant horticultural importance due to their ornamental value and adaptability to various garden settings.</p>
<p>Their distinctive appearance makes them popular choices for landscape design and collection in botanical gardens.</p>
