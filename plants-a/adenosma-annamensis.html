                <h1>Adenosma annamensis</h1>
<p>Adenosma annamensis, commonly known as the Annam adenostigma, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, opposite leaves. It produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in cymes.</p>
<p>Adenosma annamensis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenosma annamensis has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark that becomes rough with age. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in inflorescences, with a pale pink to white color, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, helping to stabilize the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma annamensis is primarily native to Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the central and northern areas. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to specific habitats within Vietnam.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenosma annamensis was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. This plant is often found in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils. Its introduction has been noted in countries like Vietnam, Cambodia, and parts of China.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has occasionally spread to nearby regions, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
