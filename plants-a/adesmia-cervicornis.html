                <h1>Adesmia cervicornis</h1>
<p>Adesmia cervicornis, commonly known as the horned adesmia, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive, curved pods. The plant typically grows in dry, arid environments and has adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its small, bright yellow flowers are followed by elongated, twisted fruits that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its unique morphology, particularly the horn-like structures on its stems.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adesmia cervicornis has small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright and branching. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia cervicornis is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, growing in rocky soils and open habitats. This plant thrives in environments with low rainfall and high sun exposure. It is often seen in desert scrub and chaparral vegetation types.</p>
<p>Its native range extends into parts of Baja California, Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adesmia cervicornis was mainly introduced to new habitats in regions with disturbed soils and open environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas where human activity has altered the landscape, such as along roadsides and in abandoned fields. The plant's ability to thrive in these conditions makes it a successful invasive species in certain ecosystems. Its introduction has led to competition with native plants, affecting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Efforts to control its spread are ongoing in regions where it has become established.</p>
