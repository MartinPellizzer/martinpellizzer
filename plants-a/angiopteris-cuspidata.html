<p>Angiopteris cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often submerged in water. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Angiopteris cuspidata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms.</p>
