                <h1>Acinodendron sellowianum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron sellowianum, commonly known as the Sellow's acacia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role and has been studied for its potential in ecological restoration projects.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron sellowianum has compound, pinnate leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with lanceolate leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as a shrub or small tree. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, helping the plant anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron sellowianum is a rare tropical plant native to Brazil, specifically found in the Atlantic Forest region.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few scattered locations within this biome, primarily in the state of Paran√°. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, often near rivers or in humid valleys. The species is typically found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and fragmentation, Acinodendron sellowianum is classified as critically endangered, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>
