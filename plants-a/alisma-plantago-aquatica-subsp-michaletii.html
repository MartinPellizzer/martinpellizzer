<p>Alisma plantago-aquatica subsp.</p>
<p>michaletii, commonly known as the Michaleti's water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern Asia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base, with a smooth, waxy surface adapted to aquatic environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the summer months. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in marshes, pond margins, and along slow-moving streams.</p>
