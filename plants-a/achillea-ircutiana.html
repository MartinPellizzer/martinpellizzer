                <h1>Achillea ircutiana</h1>
<p>Achillea ircutiana, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, fluffy white to pale yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped, gray-green in color, and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Achillea ircutiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea ircutiana has basal leaves that are lance-shaped, dark green, and slightly hairy, arranged in a rosette pattern with a diameter of about 5-10 cm.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, covered with fine hairs, and has a pale green color, growing from the base to a height of approximately 30-60 cm. Its flowers are small, composite, and yellow in color, arranged in flat-topped clusters known as corymbs, blooming from June to August, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene with a pappus, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea ircutiana is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of southern Europe, where it has been introduced and occasionally naturalized. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, and sunny environments, often found in alpine meadows and steppe areas. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Achillea ircutiana is considered to be of conservation concern in its native range.</p>
