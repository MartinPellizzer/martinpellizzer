                    <h1>Antiaris toxicaria var. macrophylla</h1>
<p>Antiaris toxicaria var. macrophylla, commonly known as the giant arrowleaf, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its large, broad, arrow-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>Native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, it is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that are followed by distinctive red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water in arid environments.</p>
<p>However, it is toxic due to the presence of cardiac glycosides, making it potentially dangerous if ingested.</p>
