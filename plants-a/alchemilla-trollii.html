<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to retain moisture in its arid, alpine habitat.</p>
<p>Alchemilla trollii is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems.</p>
