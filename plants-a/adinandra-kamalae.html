                <h1>Adinandra kamalae</h1>
<p>Adinandra kamalae, commonly known as the Kona mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Hawaii.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture.</p>
<p>Adinandra kamalae plays a role in local ecosystems and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adinandra kamalae has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5â€“8 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an erect growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra kamalae is primarily native to the East Himalaya.</p>
<p>It is found in the mountainous regions of eastern Nepal, northern India, and Bhutan. This species thrives in temperate and subtropical climates at high elevations. It is commonly found in forests and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within the East Himalayan region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adinandra kamalae was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as part of ornamental horticulture.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in cultivated areas and along roadsides where it thrives in disturbed soils. The plant is known for its attractive foliage and has been used in landscaping due to its hardiness and adaptability. However, it has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely limited to regions with a tropical or subtropical climate.</p>
