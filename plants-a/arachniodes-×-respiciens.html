                    <h1>Arachniodes × respiciens</h1>
<p>Arachniodes × respiciens, commonly known as the spider fern, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Arachniodes felix-marmoratus and Arachniodes standishii.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous fern characterized by its large, intricate fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The fronds are bi-pinnate, with a distinctive spider-like appearance due to their finely divided, arching pinnae. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>This plant is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to create a lush, tropical ambiance in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
