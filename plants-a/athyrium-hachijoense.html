                    <h1>Athyrium hachijoense</h1>
<p>Athyrium hachijoense, commonly known as the Hachijo fern, is a rare and endemic species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green with a fine, silky texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, humus-filled soil. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
