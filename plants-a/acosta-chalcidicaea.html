<p>Acosta chalcidicaea, commonly known as the Mexican nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, and it is often found in rocky or arid environments. Acosta chalcidicaea is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, and it thrives in full sun with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its fruit, a small, berry-like structure, is edible but contains toxic alkaloids, so it should be handled with care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta chalcidicaea has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with lanceolate leaflets measuring approximately 2-4 cm in length, exhibiting a dark green color with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, featuring white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
