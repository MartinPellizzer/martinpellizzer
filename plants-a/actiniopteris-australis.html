<p>Actiniopteris australis, commonly known as the southern shield fern, is a species of fern native to southern regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into a series of lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
