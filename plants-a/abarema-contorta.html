                        <h1>Abarema contorta</h1>
<p>Abarema contorta, commonly known as the twisted legume, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes and beans, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed or open habitats. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive papilionaceous structure.</p>
<p>Abarema contorta is valued for its ornamental potential and has been studied for its ecological and medicinal properties.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abarema contorta is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil.</p>
<p>It is found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans the eastern coast of the country. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and moderate to high rainfall. It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as undergrowth in dense forests.</p>
<p>Abarema contorta is also occasionally reported in parts of Paraguay and Argentina.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abarema contorta was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is often found in tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in South America. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native vegetation in non-native regions.</p>
