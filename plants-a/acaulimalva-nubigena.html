                    <h1>Acaulimalva nubigena</h1>
<p>Acaulimalva nubigena, commonly known as the cloud-born mallows, is a unique flowering plant characterized by its lack of a distinct stem, with leaves directly emerging from the root system.</p>
<p>It produces showy, pentagonal flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters at the base of the plant. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its flowers bloom during the cooler months, attracting specific pollinators such as moths and bees.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, Acaulimalva nubigena is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
