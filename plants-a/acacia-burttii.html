                        <h1>Acacia burttii</h1>
<p>Acacia burttii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a shrub or small tree native to East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, feather-like segments. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact globular inflorescences, followed by woody pods containing flat, fibrous seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates.</p>
<p>The bark and sap of Acacia burttii have been used in traditional medicine for their potential health benefits.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia burttii is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in rocky outcrops and along riverbanks. This species is well adapted to dry climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions. It is commonly seen in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Acacia burttii is also known for its distinctive yellow flowers and its importance in local ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia burttii was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils and moderate rainfall.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia where it has been cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. The plant thrives in full sun and is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions. Its introduction has also contributed to soil stabilization in degraded lands.</p>
<p>However, in some regions, it has become invasive, raising concerns about its ecological impact.</p>
