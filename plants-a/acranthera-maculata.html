                <h1>Acranthera maculata</h1>
<p>Acranthera maculata, commonly known as the spotted acranthera, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its delicate, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Acranthera maculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acranthera maculata has leaves that are narrow and lanceolate in shape, with a bluish-green color and a hairy surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a pale green color, growing upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, white with purple markings, and have a tubular shape, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in arid environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera maculata is primarily native to Borneo.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. It thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing along forest floors or in undergrowth. The species is known for its distinctive white and pink flowers, which bloom during the wet season.</p>
<p>Acranthera maculata plays an important ecological role in supporting local insect and pollinator populations.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acranthera maculata was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal dunes and sandy heathlands. This plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It has a low maintenance requirement, making it suitable for ecological landscaping.</p>
<p>However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments.</p>
