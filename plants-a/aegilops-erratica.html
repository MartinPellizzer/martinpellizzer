                <h1>Aegilops erratica</h1>
<p>Aegilops erratica, commonly known as the goat grass, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are often covered in a distinctive, hairy coating. It is a perennial species that thrives in dry, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Aegilops erratica is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a forage crop.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops erratica has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a bluish-green color and a slightly rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is usually clumping or spreading. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, pale blue to greenish flowers that bloom in the spring, and they are primarily pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-angled spikelet that contains three seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to the lightweight nature of the seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
