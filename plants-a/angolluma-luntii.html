                    <h1>Angolluma luntii</h1>
<p>Angolluma luntii, commonly known as the Moonlight Orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale purple flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial shade to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
