<p>Artemisia marschalliana, commonly known as Marsh's wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine, downy hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clustered inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Artemisia marschalliana is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements.</p>
