<p>Aporrhiza paniculata, commonly known as the Atlantic cordgrass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the western Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are adapted to withstand saltwater spray and tidal inundation. Its inflorescence consists of a branched cluster of small, greenish-white flowers that are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>Aporrhiza paniculata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
