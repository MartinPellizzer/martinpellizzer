                <h1>Adenia huillensis</h1>
<p>Adenia huillensis, commonly known as the Huill√© Adenia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Passifloraceae, which includes over 500 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, large heart-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, showy flowers. It produces edible fruits that are typically consumed raw or cooked.</p>
<p>Adenia huillensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food for various animals and contributing to the biodiversity of the region.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia huillensis has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that has a slightly rough texture. Its flowers are clustered in inflorescences, featuring five petal-like sepals and stamen, with a pinkish-white color, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, elongated seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia huillensis is primarily native to Angola.</p>
<p>It is found in the southern part of the country, particularly in the Cuando Cubango and Cunene provinces. This plant typically grows in rocky habitats and dry forests. It is adapted to the semi-arid climate of its native range.</p>
<p>Adenia huillensis is an important component of the local flora in Angola.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia huillensis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments, making it suitable for understory planting in forests or gardens. The plant is commonly found in regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru, where it grows in humid, mountainous habitats. It has also been introduced to some parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and unique flowers.</p>
<p>However, its spread is limited by its specific climatic and soil requirements.</p>
