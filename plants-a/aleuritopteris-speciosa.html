<p>Aleuritopteris speciosa, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often submerged, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>The fronds are divided into numerous pinnae, which are arranged in a distinctive, bipinnate pattern.</p>
