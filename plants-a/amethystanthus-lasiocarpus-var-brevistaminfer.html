<p>Amethystanthus lasiocarpus var. brevistaminfer, commonly known as the short-vested amethyst flower, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy, glandular leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its unique varietal name, *brevistaminfer*, refers to its shorter, more condensed stipules compared to the typical form.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native environment.</p>
