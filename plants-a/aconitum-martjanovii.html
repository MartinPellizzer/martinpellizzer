                <h1>Aconitum martjanovii</h1>
<p>Aconitum martjanovii, commonly known as the Siberian monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet spurred flowers. The plant has large, deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Aconitum martjanovii contains potent toxins, making it both a dangerous and notable species in botanical studies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum martjanovii has leaves that are compound, with palmately arranged leaflets that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, dark green in color, and often slightly hairy.</p>
<p>The stem is erect, smooth, and glabrous, with a reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are blue to purple, forming dense panicle inflorescences, and bloom in late summer; they are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that releases small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are thick, tuberous, and extensively branched, serving as storage organs for nutrients.</p>
