                <h1>Achyrophorus chrysanthus</h1>
<p>Achyrophorus chrysanthus, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus chrysanthus has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and exhibits a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with yellow petals and a prominent central stamen, blooming in late spring to early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus chrysanthus is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters. This plant is particularly associated with the Korean Peninsula and parts of southern China, where it grows in moist, shaded environments. It is also known to occur in the northeastern regions of India and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and often restricted to remote, undisturbed areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achyrophorus chrysanthus was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas, particularly in the eastern United States. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some natural areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness.</p>
<p>However, it is not currently considered a major threat to native ecosystems.</p>
