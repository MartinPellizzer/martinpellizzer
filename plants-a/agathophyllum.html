                    <h1>Agathophyllum</h1>
<p>Agathophyllum, commonly known as the desert sage or silverleaf sage, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Agathophyllum species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with narrow, often spiny leaves and small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple.</p>
<p>These plants are adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making them important components of desert ecosystems.</p>
