<p>Anathallis meridana, commonly known as the midday spider orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a single, elongated spike bearing several showy, spider-like flowers. The plant's leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to thrive in the humid, shaded environments of its natural habitat. Anathallis meridana is known for its ephemeral blooming period, typically occurring during the dry season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss.</p>
