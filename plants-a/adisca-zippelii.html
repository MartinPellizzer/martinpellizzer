                <h1>Adisca zippelii</h1>
<p>Adisca zippelii, commonly known as the Zippel's spurge, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure typical of the spurge family. Adisca zippelii is native to South Africa and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adisca zippelii has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green, glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adisca zippelii is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the grassland and shrubland ecosystems of these areas. This plant is often associated with rocky soils and is typically found in open habitats. It is also known to occur in parts of Lesotho and Eswatini.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adisca zippelii was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability to mild climates.</p>
<p>It has since been reported in several countries across Southern Europe, including Spain, Italy, and Greece. The plant's introduction is primarily associated with horticultural trade and landscape gardening practices. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution is currently limited but expanding in areas with suitable climatic conditions.</p>
