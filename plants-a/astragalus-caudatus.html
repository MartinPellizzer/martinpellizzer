                    <h1>Astragalus caudatus</h1>
<p>Astragalus caudatus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and cylindrical, hairy stems that often branch near the base. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the upper leaves. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to thrive in dry, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Astragalus caudatus plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
