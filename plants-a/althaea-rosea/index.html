                            <h1>Althaea Rosea</h1>
<p>Marshmallow plant, scientifically known as Althaea rosea, is a striking member of the Malvaceae family native to the eastern United States. This herbaceous perennial is celebrated for its soft, fuzzy leaves and showy pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its velvety foliage and delicate blossoms make it a popular choice for ornamental gardens and natural landscapes. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it adaptable to a variety of growing conditions. With its historical use in herbal medicine and its aesthetic appeal, the marshmallow plant remains a valued addition to both ecological and horticultural settings.</p>
