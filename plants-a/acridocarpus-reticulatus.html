                <h1>Acridocarpus reticulatus</h1>
<p>Acridocarpus reticulatus, commonly known as the Malabar chestnut, is a small evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant is notable for its hard, woody fruits that enclose a single seed, which is often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus reticulatus has simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture and a moderate size.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, brownish bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the dry season and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network near the surface, aiding in water absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus reticulatus is primarily native to the islands of the Indian Ocean, including Madagascar, the Comoros, and parts of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland regions with a tropical climate. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with mangrove forests or brackish water environments. It is also present in some parts of Southeast Asia, such as the Philippines and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological preferences, it is typically restricted to specific habitats within its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acridocarpus reticulatus was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions such as Hawaii, Fiji, and Samoa.</p>
<p>It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive, palm-like appearance. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas or near human settlements. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in some parts of these islands, where it now grows in the wild.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems.</p>
