<p>Acacia pycnantha var. petiolaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved golden wattle, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, dark green leaves that are narrow and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in winter, which are clustered in spherical heads, making it a striking ornamental plant. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and sandy environments.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to the more widely known Acacia pycnantha, but it has distinct leaf morphology and is less commonly cultivated.</p>
