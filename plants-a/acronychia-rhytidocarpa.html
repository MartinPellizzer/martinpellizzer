<p>Acronychia rhytidocarpa, commonly known as the rough-seed holly, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other tropical hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and elliptical, dark green leaves with a leathery texture. Its small, yellowish-white flowers are followed by woody, spherical fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in coastal and inland rainforests, where it thrives in humid, shaded conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia rhytidocarpa has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, often reddish underside.</p>
<p>The leaves are arranged along the stem and vary in size, typically ranging from 5 to 15 centimeters in length.

<p>Acronychia rhytidocarpa is primarily native to northern Australia, specifically the northern territories of Queensland and the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical rainforests and coastal areas of these regions. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil. It is often associated with rocky outcrops and is part of the Meliaceae family.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific ecological zones within Australia.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia rhytidocarpa was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of native Australian plants for ornamental and ecological purposes. The plant thrives in coastal and sandy soils, making it suitable for specific habitats in its new environment. However, it has shown limited naturalization and is not considered invasive in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Its distribution remains primarily confined to cultivated areas and botanical gardens.</p>
