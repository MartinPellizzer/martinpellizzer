<p>Angraecum ramosum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a climbing epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It features long, wiry stems that bear numerous racemes of fragrant, white to pale violet flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by the hawkmoth, which has a long proboscis adapted to reach the nectar.</p>
<p>Angraecum ramosum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums.</p>
