                    <h1>Acacia ancistrophylla</h1>
<p>Acacia ancistrophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a small shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features slender, often spiny stems and narrow, feathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It is well adapted to drought and can thrive in poor soils, making it a resilient component of its ecosystem.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
