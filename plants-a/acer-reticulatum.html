                <h1>Acer reticulatum</h1>
<p>Acer reticulatum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant belongs to the Acer genus within the Sapindaceae family. It typically grows to a height of 6â€“12 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer reticulatum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a finely toothed margin and a pointed tip, arranged alternately along the stem, and ranging in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and twining, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers in early spring, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree, pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, dispersed by wind due to the light, winged structure.</p>
<p>The roots are shallow and fibrous, anchoring the plant and aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer reticulatum is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern and central China, specifically in provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, and Tibet.</p>
<p>While it was historically confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in various parts of the world, including North America and Europe, often as an ornamental plant. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is commonly found in moist, shaded forests. This species typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although it is not currently listed as endangered, its natural habitat faces threats from deforestation and habitat fragmentation, leading to a decline in wild populations.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer reticulatum is a small, ornamental maple tree known for its delicate, lace-like foliage and compact size, making it ideal for gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or grafting, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer reticulatum is typically slow, with new growth appearing in spring and foliage turning vibrant red or orange in autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods but avoiding waterlogged conditions. Fertilize in early spring with a balanced fertilizer, and prune in late winter to maintain shape and remove dead or diseased branches.</p>
<p>It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may be affected by aphids or leaf spot, and it pairs well with plants like hostas or ferns for a shaded garden setting.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer reticulatum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy spring blossoms and provides nectar and pollen throughout the growing season. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a wide range of flora and fauna. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing slopes and protecting waterways.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer reticulatum contributes to carbon sequestration and improves soil quality through leaf litter decomposition.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer reticulatum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value, often cultivated in gardens and parks for its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional herbal teas. In medicinal contexts, it has been used in folk medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Industrially, it contributes to the timber industry, providing wood for construction and furniture.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty, often featured in artistic and symbolic representations.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer reticulatum has a variety of cultivars and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Red Sunset' and 'Crimson King', known for their striking autumn foliage. Hybrids such as 'Autumn Flame' and 'Orange Glow' have been developed to enhance color and growth characteristics. These varieties are important in horticulture for their ability to add visual interest to gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Their adaptability and aesthetic appeal make them valuable additions to both public and private gardens.</p>
