                    <h1>Acer reticulatum</h1>
<p>Acer reticulatum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, lobed leaves that change color with the seasons, often displaying vibrant red, orange, and yellow hues in autumn. The tree has a slender, upright growth habit with a branching pattern that creates a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in early spring before the leaves, and it produces samaras, or winged seeds, for dispersal.</p>
<p>Acer reticulatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
