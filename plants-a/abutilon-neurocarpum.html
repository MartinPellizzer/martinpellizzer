                <h1>Abutilon neurocarpum</h1>
<p>Abutilon neurocarpum, commonly known as the woolly abutilon, is a shrub native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for gardens in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular ornamental plant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Abutilon neurocarpum has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green color with a slightly pubescent surface.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a rough, hairy texture and a reddish-brown bark that becomes more fissured as the plant matures. Its flowers are pendulous, with five petals forming a bell-shaped structure, typically displaying shades of yellow to orange, and bloom during the summer months; they are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, elongated seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their lightweight and hairy appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping the plant anchor firmly in the soil and absorb nutrients efficiently.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Abutilon neurocarpum is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador.</p>
<p>Its current distribution includes parts of the Andes and some adjacent lowland areas, though its range has become fragmented due to habitat loss. It thrives in dry to semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils along riverbanks and in scrublands. This species typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from land conversion, Abutilon neurocarpum is considered endangered, with limited populations remaining in the wild.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Abutilon neurocarpum is a hardy, fast-growing shrub known for its ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds, cuttings, or layering, with cuttings being the most reliable method for maintaining varietal characteristics. This plant has a rapid growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months under optimal conditions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-draining soil and requires regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring and pruning to shape the plant and promote air circulation are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with marigolds or lavender can help deter pests and enhance its growth.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
