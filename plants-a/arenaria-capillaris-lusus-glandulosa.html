<p>Arenaria capillaris lusus glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and rocky soils in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, which aid in reducing water loss. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its root system is adapted to thrive in well-drained, nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>It is often found in coastal dunes and open fields, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
