                <h1>Adiantum viride</h1>
<p>Adiantum viride, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to various regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or near streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to the substrate.</p>
<p>Adiantum viride is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum viride has fern-like leaves that are triangular in shape, with a delicate, feathery appearance, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically small, measuring up to 15 cm in length, and are bright green in color, often with a silvery or pale underside. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a creeping or upright pattern depending on the environment. Adiantum viride produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-white in color, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The plant forms spore-bearing structures rather than true fruits and seeds, and its roots are fibrous, aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum viride is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, China, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. This fern is commonly seen in tropical and subtropical regions where the climate is warm and moist. It prefers well-drained soil and is often associated with limestone substrates.</p>
<p>Adiantum viride is a popular ornamental plant due to its delicate, feathery fronds.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum viride was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and indoor plant collections due to its attractive, delicate fronds and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is commonly cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden areas where it can add a touch of greenery without requiring direct sunlight. The plant is often used in landscape design to complement other shade-loving species and enhance the aesthetic appeal of green spaces. Its introduction has also been noted in some regions where it has become naturalized, though it is not considered invasive in most areas.</p>
<p>Adiantum viride is valued for its low maintenance requirements and adaptability to various growing conditions.</p>
