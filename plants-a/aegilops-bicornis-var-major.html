                    <h1>Aegilops bicornis var. major</h1>
<p>Aegilops bicornis var. major, commonly known as the two-awned wild oat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with two awns, which are bristle-like structures at the base of the flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic contributions to wheat improvement.</p>
