<p>Alhagi sparsifolium, commonly known as the sparse-leaved goatweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or saline soils, showing a high degree of drought tolerance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it well adapted to harsh environments.</p>
<p>Alhagi sparsifolium is also known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in degraded ecosystems.</p>
