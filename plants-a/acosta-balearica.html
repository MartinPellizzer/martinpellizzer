                <h1>Acosta balearica</h1>
<p>Acosta balearica, commonly known as the Balearic acosta, is a rare flowering plant native to the Balearic Islands.</p>
<p>It is a small herbaceous plant with slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, delicate white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acosta balearica has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, slightly hairy, and exhibits a reddish-brown color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and being pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and anchor the plant firmly in the soil, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta balearica is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly in southern Spain and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and coastal areas, often found along the shores of the Iberian Peninsula. This plant is well adapted to the dry, sunny conditions typical of its native habitat. It is commonly seen in coastal dunes and cliffs, where it withstands salty sea air and strong winds.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats that provide the right balance of sunlight, drainage, and protection from extreme weather.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acosta balearica was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, particularly in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in soils that are rich in organic matter and well-drained. This plant is often found in woodland undergrowth or along streambanks. Its introduction has been primarily for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage.</p>
<p>However, it has also shown potential for erosion control in certain habitats.</p>
