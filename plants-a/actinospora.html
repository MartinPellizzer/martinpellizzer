                    <h1>Actinospora</h1>
<p>Actinospora, commonly known as the star-shaped fungus, is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Cryphonectriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, with spores arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. These fungi are typically found in decaying wood, where they play a role in the decomposition process. Actinospora species are often associated with coniferous trees, contributing to the breakdown of lignin and other complex organic materials.</p>
<p>Their ecological significance lies in their ability to recycle nutrients in forest ecosystems.</p>
