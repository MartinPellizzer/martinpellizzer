                <h1>Acrostichum coriaceum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum coriaceum, commonly known as the tough fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are arranged in a distinctive pattern.</p>
<p>Acrostichum coriaceum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum coriaceum has large, elongated leaves that are leathery in texture, dark green in color, and arranged in a pinnate pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is thick and woody, with a rough, bark-like texture that is typically brown in color, and it grows in a creeping or upright manner depending on the environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers with a single stamen and pistil, usually yellowish in color, which bloom during the summer months and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds through mechanical means when it dries and splits open.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and anchor itself in moist, swampy habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum coriaceum is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in humid lowland areas, particularly in mangrove swamps and coastal forests. This plant thrives in saline and waterlogged soils, making it well adapted to coastal and estuarine environments. It is also occasionally found in the Caribbean and along the Atlantic coast of the United States.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to regions with high humidity and stable temperatures.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum coriaceum was mainly introduced to coastal areas and disturbed sites in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along shorelines. This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about ecological disruption in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in landscaping for its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal.</p>
