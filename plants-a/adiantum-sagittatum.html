                <h1>Adiantum sagittatum</h1>
<p>Adiantum sagittatum, commonly known as the arrowhead fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that resemble arrowheads, giving it its common name. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or near streams. Its fronds are typically 15â€“30 cm long and are composed of small, finger-like segments called pinnae.</p>
<p>Adiantum sagittatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum sagittatum has fern-like leaves that are triangular in shape, with a pointed tip and a broad base, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green, slender, and have a delicate, feathery appearance, with a length ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters. The stem is slender, upright, and has a smooth, pale green or reddish-brown bark that is slightly fibrous in texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or brownish, arranged in clusters, and are wind-pollinated during the spring season.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases spores, and the plant relies on wind for seed dispersal, with its roots being fibrous and adapted for anchoring in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum sagittatum is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, wooded areas such as forests, stream banks, and shaded rock outcrops. This fern thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with calcareous soils. It is particularly common in the eastern United States, from New England down to the southern states.</p>
<p>Adiantum sagittatum is also found in parts of southeastern Canada, including Ontario and Quebec.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum sagittatum was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the eastern United States, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, feathery fronds.</p>
<p>It has since spread into natural habitats, often colonizing moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's ability to thrive in humid environments has contributed to its establishment in both urban and rural landscapes. It is considered an invasive species in some regions because of its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
<p>Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread into native ecosystems.</p>
