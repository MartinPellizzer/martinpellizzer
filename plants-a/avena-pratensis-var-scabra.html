                    <h1>Avena pratensis var. scabra</h1>
<p>Avena pratensis var. scabra, commonly known as rough oat, is a perennial grass species characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and stems.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows and wetlands. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems, with each spikelet containing several small, two-lobed florets. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it valuable for erosion control.</p>
<p>The rough texture of its foliage is due to the presence of stiff, bristly hairs along the leaf surfaces.</p>
