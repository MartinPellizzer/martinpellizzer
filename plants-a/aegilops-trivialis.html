                <h1>Aegilops trivialis</h1>
<p>Aegilops trivialis, commonly known as wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. It is often found in agricultural fields and is considered a weed in some regions.</p>
<p>Aegilops trivialis is also of interest in botanical research due to its genetic relationship to wheat.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops trivialis has leaves that are narrow, grass-like, and linear in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a light green color and a growth pattern that is typically upright and branching. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which bloom in the spring and are wind-pollinated. The fruit is a small, naked caryopsis, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and appendages.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in disturbed soils and arid environments.</p>
