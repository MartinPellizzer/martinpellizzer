<p>Agropyron trachycaulum var. caerulescens, commonly known as blue wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Blue wheatgrass is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
