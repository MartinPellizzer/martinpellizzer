                    <h1>Arabis hirsuta f. banffica</h1>
<p>Arabis hirsuta f. banffica, commonly known as the Banff rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Canada.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of silver-white, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of leafy stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with high altitude and limited nutrients.</p>
<p>This subspecies is a notable example of adaptive evolution in alpine flora.</p>
