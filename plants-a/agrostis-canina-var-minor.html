                    <h1>Agrostis canina var. minor</h1>
<p>Agrostis canina var. minor, commonly known as mouse grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of slender, tufted blades with a bluish-green coloration. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize bare ground make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
