<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, lowland areas and is often found in secondary forests or along riverbanks. Its foliage is simple and alternate, with broad, ovate leaves that have a soft, velvety texture.</p>
<p>Adenocalymma chocoense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma chocoense has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring around 5–10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale grey bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures.

<p>Adenocalymma chocoense is primarily native to Colombia and Panama.</p>
<p>This plant is typically found in the tropical regions of these countries. It thrives in humid, warm climates with adequate rainfall. Adenocalymma chocoense is commonly found in lowland areas and near riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to the northeastern parts of Colombia and western Panama.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenocalymma chocoense was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions where its growth conditions are met.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. This plant is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses for its ornamental value. Its distribution has been expanded through horticultural trade and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>However, it remains primarily confined to its native habitat in South America.</p>
