                <h1>Adyseton gemonense</h1>
<p>Adyseton gemonense, commonly known as the Gemona bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Dolomites in northern Italy.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial with striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features lanceolate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Adyseton gemonense is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adyseton gemonense has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a glossy dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>Its stems are slender and slightly woody, with a grayish-brown bark that peels in thin strips. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with four petals, blooming in early summer and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>
