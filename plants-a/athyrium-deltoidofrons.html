                    <h1>Athyrium deltoidofrons</h1>
<p>Athyrium deltoidofrons, commonly known as the broad-lobed wood fern, is a species native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous fern characterized by its fronds that are divided into triangular, deltoid-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern along the undersides of the fronds.</p>
