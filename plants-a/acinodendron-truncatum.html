                <h1>Acinodendron truncatum</h1>
<p>Acinodendron truncatum, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and milky sap. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with elliptical, glossy leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its flowers are small, clustered, and often pink or white, while its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to arid environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acinodendron truncatum has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, typically ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, light brown bark that becomes slightly fissured with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in panicles, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron truncatum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates with high rainfall. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in swampy habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is also reported in parts of the Indian subcontinent, particularly in northeastern India.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acinodendron truncatum was mainly introduced to coastal areas and disturbed sites in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found along dunes and tidal flats. This plant is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about ecological impact in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to control its spread and restore native plant communities.</p>
