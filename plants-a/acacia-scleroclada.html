                    <h1>Acacia scleroclada</h1>
<p>Acacia scleroclada, commonly known as the hard-shelled acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often reduced to spines. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular inflorescences, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Acacia scleroclada is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a slow growth rate.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
