                    <h1>Astragalus onobrychis var. stenophyllus</h1>
<p>Astragalus onobrychis var. stenophyllus, commonly known as narrow-leaved burclover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has a deep taproot system, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Its seeds are enclosed in a pod and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
