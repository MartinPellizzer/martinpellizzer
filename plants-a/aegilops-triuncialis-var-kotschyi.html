<p>Aegilops triuncialis var. kotschyi, commonly known as the Kotschyi wild wheat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, glabrous lemma and palea, with a distinctive awn on the lemma. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as steppes and scrublands.</p>
<p>Its genetic makeup has made it a subject of interest in agricultural research for its potential in wheat improvement.</p>
