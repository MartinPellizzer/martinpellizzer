                        <h1>Acacia teitensis</h1>
<p>Acacia teitensis, commonly known as the Teita acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native environment.</p>
<p>Acacia teitensis plays a role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various insects and animals.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia teitensis is primarily native to the island of Teita in Kenya.</p>
<p>It is found in the coastal and semi-arid regions of the country. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is commonly associated with coastal dunes. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia teitensis was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in regions with mild winters and warm, dry summers. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and ability to withstand drought conditions. It has been introduced to several parts of the world, including the Mediterranean region and parts of the United States.</p>
<p>However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native environments.</p>
