                <h1>Adenostyles polyantha</h1>
<p>Adenostyles polyantha, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and prolonged flowering period.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostyles polyantha has simple, opposite leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, typically measuring 2â€“5 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits a branching growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the plant's habitat in rocky or dry environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles polyantha is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. This plant thrives in areas with mild, wet winters and dry summers. It is often seen growing in rocky soils along the coast.</p>
<p>Its native range includes parts of Oregon and Baja California as well.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostyles polyantha was mainly introduced to areas with moist, temperate climates, often found in woodland or forested regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly associated with mixed hardwood forests. The plant is known for its showy, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of North America and Europe.</p>
