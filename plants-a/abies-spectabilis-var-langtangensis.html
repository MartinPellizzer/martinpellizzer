<p>Abies spectabilis var. langtangensis, commonly known as the Langtang fir, is a rare variant of the blue fir native to the Himalayan region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a single row along the stems. The cones of this species are typically cylindrical and have a distinctive, woody structure. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range.</p>
