<p>Agrostis tenuifolia var. fretensis, commonly known as the Fretten's slender grass, is a variant of the slender grass species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, perennial grass that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green coloration, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered closely together. It is adapted to harsh environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological characteristics and ecological niche.</p>
