                    <h1>Amomis acris var. parvifolia</h1>
<p>Amomis acris var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical *Amomis acris* variety, often with a pointed base and a smooth or slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered spikes during the summer months. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a popular choice for water gardeners.</p>
