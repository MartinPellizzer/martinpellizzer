<p>Aegilops tauschii f. ferruginea, commonly known as the rusted wild rye, is a wild relative of wheat with distinctive botanical features.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial grass characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are often covered in a rusty or reddish hue, giving it its common name. It is native to regions of Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its genetic proximity to wheat, it is of interest in agricultural research for potential use in breeding programs.</p>
