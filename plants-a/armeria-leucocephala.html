                    <h1>Armeria leucocephala</h1>
<p>Armeria leucocephala, commonly known as the white-flowered thrift, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are evergreen in mild climates.</p>
<p>Armeria leucocephala is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
