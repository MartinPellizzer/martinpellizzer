                <h1>Acianthera pavimentata</h1>
<p>Acianthera pavimentata, commonly known as the pavement orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizomatous stem and produces numerous small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that form a dense mat, and its roots are often covered in a thick layer of mycorrhizal fungi. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in grasslands and forest understories.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera pavimentata has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green color and a moderate size, typically 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white to pale pink petals and a tubular structure, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and well-developed, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera pavimentata is primarily native to Brazil Southeast.</p>
<p>This orchid species is found in the southeastern region of Brazil, particularly in the states of SÃ£o Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Rio de Janeiro. It thrives in humid tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in forests and shaded areas. The plant is known for its attractive, fragrant flowers and is commonly found in the understory of dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is closely associated with the biodiversity-rich ecosystems of the Brazilian Southeast.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera pavimentata was mainly introduced to new habitats in the Southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia, where it has established itself in disturbed soils and open areas.</p>
<p>It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, sunny conditions. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes have contributed to its successful establishment in these regions. However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, its invasive tendencies have led to increased monitoring and management efforts in some areas.</p>
