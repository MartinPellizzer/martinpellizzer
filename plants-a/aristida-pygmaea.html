                    <h1>Aristida pygmaea</h1>
<p>Aristida pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf dropseed, is a low-growing grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically reaches heights of less than 10 inches, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often mistaken for cotton or dandelion fluff, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it an ecologically valuable plant in arid environments.</p>
