<p>It is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its delicate appearance and fragrant foliage.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abama scabra is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in open woodlands, grasslands, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>Abama scabra is an important component of the local flora in these regions.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abama scabra was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It was first documented in Oregon in the early 20th century as an ornamental plant. The distribution of Abama scabra has since expanded to include parts of Washington and British Columbia. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones.</p>
<p>However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
