                    <h1>Aconitum kamtschaticum</h1>
<p>Aconitum kamtschaticum, commonly known as the Siberian aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Siberia and the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It features striking blue to purple spathaceous flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed foliage that contributes to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>However, all parts of the plant contain potent toxins, making it both dangerous and requiring careful handling.</p>
