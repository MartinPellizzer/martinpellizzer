                    <h1>Argyrolobium stenorrhizon</h1>
<p>Argyrolobium stenorrhizon, commonly known as the narrow-rooted silver globular violet, is a perennial legume native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it reflect sunlight in its arid environment. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has a deep taproot system, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with suitable climates.</p>
