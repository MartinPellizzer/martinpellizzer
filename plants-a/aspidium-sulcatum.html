<p>Aspidium sulcatum, commonly known as the scaly wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in small, scaly structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, which help anchor it to substrates.</p>
<p>Aspidium sulcatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental fronds and ability to thrive in humid conditions.</p>
