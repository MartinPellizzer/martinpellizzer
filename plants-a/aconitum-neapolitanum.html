                <h1>Aconitum neapolitanum</h1>
<p>Aconitum neapolitanum, commonly known as the Naples monkshood, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, with distinctive hood-shaped petals and spurred tips. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a deep green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Aconitum neapolitanum is known for its ornamental value in gardens but is also toxic, containing potent alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum neapolitanum has palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and slightly hairy, with a greyish-brown bark that becomes more rugged as the plant matures. Its flowers are showy, blue to purple in color, with five petals and a spurred shape, blooming in late summer and pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds through a slit, with the seeds being dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, helping the plant to store nutrients and survive in its alpine habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum neapolitanum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly Italy and the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in alpine and subalpine habitats, growing in rocky soils and open meadows. This species thrives in temperate climates with cool, moist conditions and is often associated with high-altitude environments. It is also present in parts of Austria, Slovenia, and Croatia.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized plant in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum neapolitanum was mainly introduced to ornamental gardening and horticultural collections due to its striking blue-violet flowers and attractive foliage.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in moist, shady environments. The plant has been introduced to various regions outside its native range, including parts of North America and Europe. However, it is considered invasive in some areas where it can outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread in natural habitats.</p>
