                <h1>Acianthera floribunda</h1>
<p>Acianthera floribunda, commonly known as the clustered lady's slipper, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forests and shrublands. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, while its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette.</p>
<p>Acianthera floribunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera floribunda has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and typically measure between 2-5 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and herbaceous, with a smooth texture and a light green to reddish-brown color, exhibiting an upright growth pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in racemes, with a pale pink to white color, and they bloom from late spring to early summer; they are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera floribunda is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil.</p>
<p>It is found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans along the eastern coast of Brazil. This orchid species thrives in humid, tropical environments with high rainfall. It is commonly found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats within this region.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Brazil due to its particular ecological requirements.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera floribunda was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks. This plant has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California. Its introduction is likely due to human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>However, its ecological impact remains under study due to limited data on its spread and interactions with native species.</p>
