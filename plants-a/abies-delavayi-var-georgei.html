<p>Abies delavayi var. georgei, commonly known as the George's fir, is a variant of the Delavay fir native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its conical shape and dense, dark green foliage that turns a striking silver-gray in winter. The plant produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, typical of many fir species. Its needles are short and stiff, with two white stomatal bands on the underside, a feature common in the genus Abies.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant.</p>
