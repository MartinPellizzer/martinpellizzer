                <h1>Acer oblongum</h1>
<p>Acer oblongum, commonly known as the European maple, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It typically grows to a height of 15–25 meters and prefers well-drained, fertile soils.</p>
<p>The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum has broad, ovate to elliptical leaves that are alternate in arrangement, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip; they are typically 5-10 cm in length and 3-6 cm in width, and turn yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>The stem is straight and upright, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree, pollinated by wind. The fruit is a samara with two wings, dispersed by wind, and the seeds are small and winged.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and taprooted, providing stability and efficient water absorption.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern and central Europe, including parts of the Carpathian Mountains and the Balkans.</p>
<p>While it was historically more widespread, its current distribution is limited, with populations found primarily in isolated areas of the Carpathians and surrounding regions. It thrives in temperate climates, preferring moist, well-drained soils in mixed forests or along river valleys. This species typically grows at altitudes ranging from 600 to 1,800 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Acer oblongum is considered a vulnerable species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum is a deciduous tree known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring cold stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of Acer oblongum includes a dormant phase in winter, followed by rapid growth in spring and early summer.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil with moderate moisture, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Fertilization with a balanced fertilizer in early spring promotes healthy growth, while pruning should be done in late winter to shape the tree and remove diseased branches. Common pests include aphids and scale insects, while diseases like powdery mildew may occur in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with herbs like lavender or marigold can help deter pests and improve soil health.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the local ecosystem's biodiversity. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing soil stability and supporting other plant life. Its extensive root system helps prevent erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing soil on slopes.</p>
<p>Additionally, Acer oblongum contributes to carbon sequestration and offers ecological benefits by improving air quality.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum is a species of maple tree known for its ornamental value and ecological significance.</p>
<p>While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its sap can be processed into syrup similar to other maple species. In traditional medicine, parts of the tree have been used to treat various ailments, though scientific validation is limited. Industrially, its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, making it suitable for furniture and cabinetry.</p>
<p>Culturally, the tree symbolizes resilience and growth, often featured in local landscapes and botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer oblongum has several popular cultivars such as 'Columnare', known for its narrow, columnar growth, and 'Fastigiata', which exhibits a tall, upright form.</p>
<p>It also has hybrids like Acer oblongum × A. negundo, which are often used for their enhanced hardiness and ornamental features. These varieties and hybrids are valued in horticulture for their adaptability to different landscapes and their ability to provide seasonal color.</p>
<p>Horticulturists appreciate their versatility in garden design and their capacity to thrive in a range of environmental conditions.</p>
