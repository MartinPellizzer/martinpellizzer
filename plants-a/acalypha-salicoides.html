<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that becomes slightly rough with age, and it grows upright with a branching pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and are yellowish-green with stamens that are longer than the petals, blooming from late spring to early summer; they are primarily wind-pollinated. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist environments.</p>
