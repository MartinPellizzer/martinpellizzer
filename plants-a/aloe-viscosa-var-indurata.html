                    <h1>Aloe viscosa var. indurata</h1>
<p>Aloe viscosa var. indurata, commonly known as the rock aloe or hard-leaved aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a white, powdery coating called farina. The leaves are typically gray-green in color and have a waxy texture that helps the plant retain moisture. It produces yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, which are borne on tall, branched inflorescences.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine for its healing properties.</p>
