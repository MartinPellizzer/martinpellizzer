                    <h1>Alomiella</h1>
<p>Alomiella, commonly known as the alpine lichen, is a genus of lichens that belongs to the family Trapeliaceae.</p>
<p>These organisms are symbiotic, consisting of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. Alomiella species are often found growing on rocks, soil, or tree bark in alpine and arctic regions. They are characterized by their crust-like or foliose growth forms and can vary in color from yellow to orange.</p>
<p>Due to their slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, they are important indicators of air quality and ecosystem health.</p>
