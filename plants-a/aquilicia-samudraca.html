<p>Aquilicia samudraca, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom throughout the year. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion along shorelines.</p>
<p>Aquilicia samudraca is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
