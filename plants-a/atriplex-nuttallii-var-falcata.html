                    <h1>Atriplex nuttallii var. falcata</h1>
<p>Atriplex nuttallii var. falcata, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, three-lobed bracts. It is adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with low precipitation.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
