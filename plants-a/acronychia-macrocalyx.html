                <h1>Acronychia macrocalyx</h1>
<p>Acronychia macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to northern Australia and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with rough, fissured bark and elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds.</p>
<p>Acronychia macrocalyx is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronychia macrocalyx has leaves that are elliptical in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure between 5 to 10 centimeters in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is generally grey to brown in color, and it exhibits a sprawling growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the wet season, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and form a dense network, helping to stabilize the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia macrocalyx is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in the northern and eastern regions. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. It is commonly encountered in lowland and montane forest areas.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a regionally significant species within its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronychia macrocalyx was mainly introduced to urban and suburban areas in eastern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
<p>It is often found growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides due to its adaptability to various environmental conditions. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities, including its glossy leaves and fragrant white flowers. However, it has also been identified as a potential weed in some regions due to its ability to spread rapidly.</p>
<p>Its distribution is primarily influenced by human activity and habitat modification.</p>
