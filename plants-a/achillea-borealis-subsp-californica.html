                <h1>Achillea borealis subsp. californica</h1>
<p>Achillea borealis subsp.</p>
<p>californica, commonly known as the California yarrow, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of California. It features a compact, spreading growth habit with numerous narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant species suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Its aromatic foliage and long-lasting blooms make it a valuable addition to native plant collections.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea borealis subsp.</p>
<p>californica has basal, lance-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color, arranged in a rosette, and range from 2 to 6 inches in length. The stem is upright, hairy, and reddish-brown in color, with a branching growth pattern.</p>
<p>Its flowers are small, yellowish-white composite flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are primarily pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small, dry achene that is dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, allowing the plant to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea borealis subsp.</p>
<p>californica is a perennial herb native to western North America, specifically found in California and parts of Oregon. Its current distribution is limited to coastal areas and adjacent inland regions of California.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, open habitats such as coastal dunes, grasslands, and rocky slopes. This subspecies typically grows at low to moderate altitudes, ranging from sea level up to approximately 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>It is considered to be of conservation concern due to habitat loss and limited distribution, though it is not currently listed as endangered.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea borealis subsp.</p>
<p>californica is a hardy perennial that thrives in USDA zones 5-9, known for its fluffy yellow flowers and aromatic foliage. It can be propagated through seeds, division, or stem cuttings, with division being the most reliable method in early spring. This plant has a cool-season growth cycle, blooming in late spring to early summer and going dormant in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained soil and moderate watering, with reduced irrigation during the dormant season. Fertilization should be minimal, with a light application of compost in spring, while pruning dead flowers encourages new growth. It is generally pest and disease resistant but may attract aphids or spider mites in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender, thyme, or yarrow enhances its ornamental value and benefits from their shared drought tolerance.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea borealis subsp.</p>
<p>californica is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a valuable food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It attracts a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals, which rely on its seeds for sustenance.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a companion plant in native gardens, enhancing biodiversity and supporting local ecosystems. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it effective for stabilizing slopes and disturbed lands.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall health of the ecosystem by supporting a wide range of ecological interactions.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Achillea borealis subsp.</p>
<p>californica is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of California, known for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to thrive in sandy soils. While it is not widely used in culinary applications, its dried flowers may be occasionally used in herbal teas.</p>
<p>In traditional medicine, it has been used to treat respiratory issues and as a mild sedative. Its role in ecological systems supports local pollinators and helps stabilize coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and is appreciated for its beauty in native plant landscaping.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
