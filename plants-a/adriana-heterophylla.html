                <h1>Adriana heterophylla</h1>
<p>Adriana heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique and variable leaf morphology, which can range from lance-shaped to ovate depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are small and usually greenish-white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adriana heterophylla has leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, light green bark that grows upright and branching. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adriana heterophylla is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including southern Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and coastal areas, often found along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. The plant is well adapted to the dry, sunny conditions typical of its native habitat. It is commonly seen in countries such as Spain, Italy, and Greece.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in similar climates outside its natural range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adriana heterophylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 1980s and has since spread throughout the North Island. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, farmland, and urban areas. It is considered a potential weed due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Despite its invasive potential, it is not currently classified as a noxious weed in New Zealand.</p>
