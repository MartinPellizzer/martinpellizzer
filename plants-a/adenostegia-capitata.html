                <h1>Adenostegia capitata</h1>
<p>Adenostegia capitata, commonly known as the woolly goldenbush, is a shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Adenostegia capitata is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenostegia capitata has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape, ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and it exhibits an upright growth pattern. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, blooming from spring to early summer, and is pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Its root system is shallow and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostegia capitata is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal and inland regions, particularly in areas with Mediterranean climates. This plant thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, dunes, and disturbed soils. It is well adapted to dry conditions and can tolerate seasonal droughts.</p>
<p>Adenostegia capitata plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local wildlife.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenostegia capitata was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
<p>It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is native to South America but has been introduced to various regions including parts of the United States. It forms dense mats that help prevent soil erosion and reduce sediment runoff.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
