                <h1>Adicea multiflora</h1>
<p>Adicea multiflora, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves and clusters of showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10-20 cm and thrives in bright, indirect light. It prefers well-draining soil and moderate humidity, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
<p>Adicea multiflora is known for its ability to bloom continuously throughout the year under proper care.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea multiflora has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 cm in length, and a dark green, glossy upper surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, slightly hairy, and has a pale green color, growing upright with a branching pattern. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea multiflora is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments within rainforests and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly found in the understory of dense vegetation, where it benefits from the dappled sunlight. Its natural range extends across parts of Central and Southern Africa as well.</p>
<p>Adicea multiflora is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental qualities.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea multiflora was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly along riverbanks and forest edges.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the risks associated with non-native species in ecological systems.</p>
