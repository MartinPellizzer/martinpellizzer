                <h1>Adiantum pulchellum</h1>
<p>Adiantum pulchellum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, silky-hairy fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its fronds are typically biennial, with the plant producing spore-bearing structures in the second year.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Adiantum pulchellum make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening due to its unique texture and aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum pulchellum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately compound, with finely divided, lanceolate lobes that are typically bright green and arranged in a bipinnate pattern.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually 15â€“30 cm long, with a delicate, papery texture and a light green to bluish-green color. The plant has a short, unbranched stem that is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish-yellow in color, blooming in early spring, and are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, and the roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum pulchellum is primarily native to the Lesser Sunda Islands.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical regions of Indonesia, including islands such as Bali, Lombok, and Sumba. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in forests or along stream sides. It is known for its delicate, lace-like fronds and is a popular ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific island groups in the Indonesian archipelago.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum pulchellum was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, delicate fronds. The distribution of this species has been largely confined to cultivated areas and garden settings. Despite its introduction, it has not become naturalized in the wild in New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in private gardens and botanical collections.</p>
