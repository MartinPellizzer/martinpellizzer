                <h1>Acronia muriculata</h1>
<p>Acronia muriculata, commonly known as the roughleaf acronia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in small, stiff hairs. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough, textured surface and serrated edges. Its small, greenish-white flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its aromatic foliage and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia muriculata has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a rough, ridged texture and a reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming in early summer and pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia muriculata is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly in the coastal regions of South Carolina and Georgia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. This species is commonly found in dune environments and moist, open habitats. It is an important component of coastal ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable plant species in its native range.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia muriculata was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been found growing in disturbed soils and along urban areas, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions. The plant's ability to spread rapidly has led to concerns about its impact on native flora in invaded regions. It is often found in coastal and sandy environments, where it forms dense colonies.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised questions about its ecological role and potential for becoming an invasive species.</p>
