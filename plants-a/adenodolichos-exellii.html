                <h1>Adenodolichos exellii</h1>
<p>Adenodolichos exellii, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and often nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features compound leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. It is known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Adenodolichos exellii thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos exellii has compound, trifoliate leaves that are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, and measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly pubescent, with a pale green to brownish color, and it exhibits an ascending growth pattern. The flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months, and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a legume pod that matures into a dry, dehiscent pod, containing small, rounded seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos exellii is primarily native to Angola and Zambia.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the southern regions of Angola, particularly in the Cuando Cubango Province. In Zambia, it occurs in the eastern part of the country, near the border with Angola. It typically grows in savanna and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to these specific areas within the two countries.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenodolichos exellii was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, gardens, and along riverbanks. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and climatic conditions. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in local ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, it is not currently classified as a major threat to native flora in the region.</p>
