                    <h1>Aphania dictyophylla</h1>
<p>Aphania dictyophylla, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, thread-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Aphania dictyophylla is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
