                        <h1>Acacia verugera</h1>
<p>Acacia verugera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, feathery leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are often visited by native bees and birds, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Acacia verugera is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, improving soil fertility.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia verugera is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and parts of South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in savannas and shrublands. This species is well adapted to dry climates and can survive with minimal rainfall. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Acacia verugera is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which helps improve soil fertility in nutrient-poor environments.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia verugera was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It has been widely planted for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes. The plant is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to provide shade and forage for livestock. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distribution is primarily limited to regions where it can establish itself without significant competition from native vegetation.</p>
