<p>It features small, rose-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of pink to red, from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that are often described as rough to the touch, contributing to its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings.</p>
