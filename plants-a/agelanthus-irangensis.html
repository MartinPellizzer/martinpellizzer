                    <h1>Agelanthus irangensis</h1>
<p>Agelanthus irangensis, commonly known as the Irangensis cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and large, pinnate leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, which is a notable feature in its reproductive biology. Its cones, which are the reproductive structures, are typically found on separate plants and are essential for seed production.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Agelanthus irangensis is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
