<p>Arctium × semiconstrictum, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a hybrid plant in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces purple to pink flower heads that resemble thistle-like blooms, which are surrounded by bracts that develop into burrs.
