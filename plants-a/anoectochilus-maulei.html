<p>Anoectochilus maulei, commonly known as the Maule's slipper orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has a short, compact growth habit with thick, fleshy roots adapted for nutrient absorption from the air. It prefers high humidity and indirect light, making it a challenging species to cultivate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native regions.</p>
