<p>Asplenium filare subsp.</p>
<p>canariense, commonly known as the Canary spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in dense clusters.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky soils or in shaded forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
