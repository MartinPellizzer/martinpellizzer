The plant's inflorescence consists of a tall, spiky flower stem that bears showy, colorful bracts, often in red, orange, or yellow. Aechmea brachycaulis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>It is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
