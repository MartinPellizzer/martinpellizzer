<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features finely divided, gray-green leaves that are arranged in an alternate pattern along the stems. Its flowers are typically white to pale yellow, forming flat-topped clusters known as corymbs.</p>
<p>Achillea striata is often found in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky soils, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical medicinal uses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>

Its flowers are small, composite, and consist of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets, blooming from late spring to early autumn, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a achene, with a pappus for wind dispersal, allowing the seeds to be carried by the wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish itself in various environments.</p>
