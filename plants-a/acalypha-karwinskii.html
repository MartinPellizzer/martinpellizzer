<p>Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse morphological features.</p>
<p>Its order is Malpighiales, a large group of flowering plants that includes many species with specialized structures like pseudostems and unique leaf arrangements. Its family is Euphorbiaceae, commonly known as the spurge family, which includes plants with milky sap and often showy flowers. Its genus is Acalypha, a group of flowering plants commonly known as "velvetleaf" or "Indian mallow," characterized by their showy bracts and hairy leaves.</p>
<p>Its species is Acalypha karwinskii, a specific plant within the genus Acalypha, known for its ornamental value and distinctive foliage.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha karwinskii is primarily native to Mexico Northeast.</p>
<p>This plant is found in the northeastern regions of Mexico, particularly in the states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo Le√≥n, and parts of Coahuila. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded areas within forests or along riverbanks. The species is well adapted to humid environments with moderate to high rainfall.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is limited to these specific regions in northeastern Mexico.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acalypha karwinskii was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. The plant thrives in coastal and disturbed habitats, often spreading through both seed dispersal and vegetative propagation. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has been classified as a potential environmental weed due to its ability to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now primarily confined to the northern and eastern parts of New Zealand.</p>
