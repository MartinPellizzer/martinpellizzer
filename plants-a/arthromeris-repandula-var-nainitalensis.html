                    <h1>Arthromeris repandula var. nainitalensis</h1>
<p>Arthromeris repandula var. nainitalensis, commonly known as the Nainital rock fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the alpine regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, typically between 2,000 and 3,500 meters. Its fronds are covered in small, scattered glands that secrete a waxy substance, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its adaptation to extreme environmental conditions, making it a unique subject of botanical study.</p>
