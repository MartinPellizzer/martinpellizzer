<p>Aspilia paludosa, commonly known as swamp aster, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and showy, yellow to orange inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Aspilia paludosa plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
