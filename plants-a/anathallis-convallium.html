                    <h1>Anathallis convallium</h1>
<p>Anathallis convallium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, pale green stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that resemble those of the common cow plant, hence its specific epithet "convallium.". The plant lacks leaves and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to cling to tree bark. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
