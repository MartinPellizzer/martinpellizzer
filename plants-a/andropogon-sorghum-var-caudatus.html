<p>Andropogon sorghum var. caudatus, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and feathery, silver-green plumes that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types and is drought-resistant, making it suitable for marginal lands. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil structure.</p>
<p>Switchgrass is also valued for its potential as a bioenergy crop due to its high biomass yield and low input requirements.</p>
