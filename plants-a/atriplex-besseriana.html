<p>Atriplex besseriana, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, salt-tolerant leaves that help it survive in saline soils. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its fibrous roots enable it to access water from deep underground, making it well adapted to dry environments.</p>
<p>Atriplex besseriana is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and reduce erosion.</p>
