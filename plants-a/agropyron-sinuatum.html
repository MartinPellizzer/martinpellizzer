<p>Agropyron sinuatum, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green leaves and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Agropyron sinuatum is also valued for its nutritional content and is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop.</p>
