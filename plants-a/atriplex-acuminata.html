                    <h1>Atriplex acuminata</h1>
<p>Atriplex acuminata, commonly known as shadscale, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its succulent stems and leaves store water, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Atriplex acuminata plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
