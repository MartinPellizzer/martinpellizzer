                    <h1>Ammannia senegalensis f. diffusa</h1>
<p>Ammannia senegalensis f. diffusa, commonly known as the swamp bladderwrack, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Lythraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its unique morphology includes inflated, bladder-like structures that aid in buoyancy and water retention.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its more diffuse growth habit and distinct floral arrangement.</p>
