                    <h1>Arenaria xerophila var. xiangchengensis</h1>
<p>Arenaria xerophila var. xiangchengensis, commonly known as the Xiangcheng sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to semi-desert and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolution in response to harsh, drought-prone conditions.</p>
