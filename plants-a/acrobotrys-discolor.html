                <h1>Acrobotrys discolor</h1>
<p>Acrobotrys discolor, commonly known as the red-spored earthstar, is a unique member of the earthstar family (Geastraceae).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped cap that opens to reveal a spore-filled cavity. The fruiting body typically emerges from the soil, with a fleshy, reddish-brown outer layer that becomes dry and papery as it matures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in decomposing organic matter and contributes to soil health through its mycorrhizal associations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrobotrys discolor has leaves that are broadly ovate to round in shape, with a wavy margin, arranged alternately along the stem, and varying in size from 2 to 5 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a slightly hairy texture. The stem is slender, somewhat woody, and has a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring and are pollinated by wind. Its fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or loamy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrobotrys discolor is primarily native to Colombia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. It is part of the Lecanoraceae family and is known for its unique discoloration patterns.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to specific ecological niches within Colombia's diverse ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrobotrys discolor was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as trade, gardening, and landscaping.</p>
<p>It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of North America and Europe. The plant's ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its rapid growth rate contribute to its successful establishment in these areas. It is often found in urban environments, along roadsides, and in neglected gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is monitored in many regions to prevent further spread.</p>
