                    <h1>Acrobotrys discolor</h1>
<p>Acrobotrys discolor, commonly known as the red-spored earthstar, is a unique member of the earthstar family (Geastraceae).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped cap that opens to reveal a spore-filled cavity. The fruiting body typically emerges from the soil, with a fleshy, reddish-brown outer layer that becomes dry and papery as it matures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in decomposing organic matter and contributes to soil health through its mycorrhizal associations.</p>
