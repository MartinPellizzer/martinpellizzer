                    <h1>Axonopus casiquiarensis</h1>
<p>Axonopus casiquiarensis, commonly known as the Casiquiare rivergrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly found in the floodplains of the Casiquiare River.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in wetland and riparian environments, adapting to seasonal flooding and nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly and stabilize soil along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Axonopus casiquiarensis plays an important ecological role in maintaining habitat for aquatic and terrestrial organisms in its native range.</p>
