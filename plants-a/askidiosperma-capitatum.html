<p>Askidiosperma capitatum, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its acoustic properties. The plant has compound leaves with small, opposite leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is often found in humid, lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species.</p>
