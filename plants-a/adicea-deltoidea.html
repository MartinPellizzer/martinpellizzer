                <h1>Adicea deltoidea</h1>
<p>Adicea deltoidea, commonly known as the delta leaf daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its deltoid-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers with white ray florets. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.</p>
<p>Adicea deltoidea is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea deltoidea has simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are usually green and have a smooth texture, with a slightly wavy margin.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, hairy, and has a light green to reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in early spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and help anchor the plant in moist, shady environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea deltoidea is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest understories and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with montane and lowland rainforest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Adicea deltoidea is also occasionally found in parts of southern Arabia and the Middle East.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea deltoidea was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticultural trade and accidental transport.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments, thriving in areas with moderate to high light exposure. The plant's ability to spread rapidly makes it an invasive species in many regions where it has been introduced. It often outcompetes native vegetation, leading to ecological imbalances.</p>
<p>Proper management is essential to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems.</p>
