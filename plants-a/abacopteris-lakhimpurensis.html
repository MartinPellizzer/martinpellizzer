                        <h1>Abacopteris lakhimpurensis</h1>
<p>Abacopteris lakhimpurensis, commonly known as the Lakhimpur fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the northeastern region of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical rainforests. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and it plays a minor but important role in the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Abacopteris lakhimpurensis belongs to the kingdom Plantae, phylum Magnoliophyta, class Equisetopsida, subclass Equisetidae, order Equisetales, family Equisetaceae, genus Abacopteris, and species lakhimpurensis.</p>
<p>This fern is characterized by its unique morphology and ecological adaptations. It is native to specific regions in India, particularly in the state of Manipur. The species is notable for its historical and potential medicinal significance.</p>
<p>Its taxonomical classification reflects its evolutionary relationships within the Equisetaceae family.</p>
