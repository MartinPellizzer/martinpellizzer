<p>Atriplex cuneata, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent leaves, which are often coated with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, three-angled fruits.</p>
<p>Atriplex cuneata plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife and livestock.</p>
