                <h1>Aechmea carvalhoi</h1>
<p>Aechmea carvalhoi, commonly known as the Carvalho's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from rainfall. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with brightly colored bracts that can range from red to orange. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical environment.</p>
<p>Aechmea carvalhoi is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aechmea carvalhoi has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, strap-like, and often have a waxy texture, arranged in a compact circle around the central stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically dark green with a bluish tint and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. The plant has a short, thick, and somewhat succulent stem that is usually covered in a dense, fibrous bark. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, violet-colored flowers that bloom during the wet season, and it is pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that disperses its seeds through wind and water.</p>
