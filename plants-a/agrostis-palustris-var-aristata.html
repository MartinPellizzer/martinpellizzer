                    <h1>Agrostis palustris var. aristata</h1>
<p>Agrostis palustris var. aristata, commonly known as the meadow oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wet or moist habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshes, along stream banks, and in other damp environments where it can thrive in poorly drained soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas.</p>
