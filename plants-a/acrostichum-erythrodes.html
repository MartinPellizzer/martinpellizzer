                <h1>Acrostichum erythrodes</h1>
<p>Acrostichum erythrodes, commonly known as the red-stemmed brake fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a reddish hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in soil stabilization in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are closely spaced and have a serrated margin.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum erythrodes has large, leathery, lanceolate leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often reddish underside.</p>
<p>The stem is upright and cylindrical, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that exudes a slight resinous scent. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, blooming during the summer months, and is pollinated primarily by wind. Its fruit is a three-lobed, fleshy drupe that disperses its seeds through animal ingestion and wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and establish itself in wetland environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum erythrodes is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid environments with abundant water and rich soil. It is also present in parts of the Caribbean and southern Florida.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely linked to areas with high rainfall and consistent moisture.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum erythrodes was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in humid lowlands.</p>
<p>It thrives in disturbed soils and can tolerate partial to full shade, making it a common invader in degraded habitats. This plant spreads primarily through its rhizomes, allowing it to colonize new areas rapidly. It is particularly prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions where the climate supports its growth.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns in some regions.</p>
