                <h1>Actinocephalus polyanthus</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus polyanthus, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the plant is often found in grasslands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>While it is not widely cultivated, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus polyanthus has leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a smooth, light grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and it grows as an upright shrub. Its flowers are small, clustered in terminal umbels, featuring white petals with a yellow center, blooming in spring and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to stabilize the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus polyanthus is a succulent plant native to South Africa, specifically found in the Western and Northern Cape provinces.</p>
<p>While its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including some regions of Australia and the United States, often as an ornamental plant. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, typically growing in rocky soils and crevices. This species is found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Although not currently listed as endangered, its limited natural habitat and susceptibility to habitat degradation raise concerns for its long-term conservation status.</p>
