                <h1>Actinocephalus polyanthus</h1>
<p>Actinocephalus polyanthus, commonly known as the star-shaped cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive star-like appearance, with numerous small, fleshy spines radiating from a central stem. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and adaptability, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus polyanthus has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size and a deep green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly woody, with a light green to brownish bark that becomes more rugged with age. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, featuring white to pale yellow petals and a distinct central stamen, blooming during the summer months and pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus polyanthus is primarily native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is found in the Eastern Cape province, specifically in the fynbos vegetation type. This species grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly associated with coastal and mountainous regions. It is often found in open habitats such as fynbos shrublands and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, with dry summers and wet winters.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinocephalus polyanthus was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there during the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, showy flowers. Despite its beauty, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, sunny conditions and spreads rapidly through its rhizomes.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
