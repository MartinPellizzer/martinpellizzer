                        <h1>Acacia basedowii var. viridis</h1>
<p>Acacia basedowii var. viridis, commonly known as the green acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, greenish-gray leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia basedowii var. viridis is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including parts of Namibia, Angola, and South Africa.</p>
<p>This variant is commonly found in sandy soils and rocky outcrops within these regions. It thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. The plant is often seen in shrublands and along the edges of grasslands.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely associated with the Kalahari Desert and surrounding areas.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia basedowii var. viridis was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a Mediterranean climate, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in coastal regions and dry inland areas, often forming dense shrubs. This plant is particularly adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
