                <h1>Acianthera mexiae</h1>
<p>Acianthera mexiae, commonly known as the Mexican pink orchid, is a species of orchid native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>Acianthera mexiae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera mexiae has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a smooth surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, with a smooth, pale green bark that grows upright. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers with a single lip-like petal, blooming during the summer months and relying on insect pollination. The fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds through wind and water.</p>
<p>Its roots are fibrous and shallow, helping it anchor in rocky or sandy soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera mexiae is primarily native to Peru.</p>
<p>It is found in the Andean regions of the country, particularly in the central and southern highlands. This orchid thrives in humid, temperate climates at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It is commonly associated with cloud forests and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Peru.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera mexiae was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in Florida and Texas, as part of horticultural and ornamental plant collections.</p>
<p>It was brought in during the 20th century by botanists and plant enthusiasts interested in its unique floral characteristics. The plant has since established populations in certain regions, though it remains relatively rare in the wild. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to compete with native species.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental appeal, efforts are ongoing to monitor its spread and impact on local ecosystems.</p>
