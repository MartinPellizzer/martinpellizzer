                <h1>Adicea peltata</h1>
<p>Adicea peltata, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a perennial herb native to wetlands and marshy areas in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted for aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Adicea peltata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting aquatic life.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adicea peltata has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are typically green and have a slightly waxy surface.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and cylindrical, with a smooth, light green bark that tends to become slightly rough with age. Its small, clustered flowers are white to pale yellow, with five petals and a tubular structure, blooming in late spring and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to poor soil conditions and helping stabilize the plant in its habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea peltata is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas.</p>
<p>It is also found in parts of Central America, including Mexico and the Greater Antilles. This plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests. It is often associated with sandy soils and is known for its distinctive, palm-like appearance.</p>
<p>Adicea peltata plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting local biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adicea peltata was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks. This plant has become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species. Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range, particularly in temperate regions of North America.</p>
<p>Adicea peltata is now considered a weed in many agricultural and natural areas.</p>
