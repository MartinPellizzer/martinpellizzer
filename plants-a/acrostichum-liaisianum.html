                    <h1>Acrostichum liaisianum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum liaisianum, commonly known as the Laisian shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in lowland rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
