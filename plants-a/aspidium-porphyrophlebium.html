<p>Aspidium porphyrophlebium, commonly known as the purple-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often tinged with a striking purple hue along the veins. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>The fronds are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments, contributing to its ornamental appeal in aquatic gardens.</p>
