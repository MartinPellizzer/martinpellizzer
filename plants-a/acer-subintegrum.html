                <h1>Acer subintegrum</h1>
<p>Acer subintegrum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ornamental foliage, which displays vibrant colors during the growing season and autumn. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras (winged seeds) for dispersal.</p>
<p>Acer subintegrum thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer subintegrum has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically measure 5-10 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside.</p>
<p>The stem is smooth and reddish-brown, with a straight growth pattern and a slightly rough texture when mature. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, with a simple structure and wind as the primary pollination method. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to moist soil conditions.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer subintegrum is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, primarily found in China, Korea, and Japan.</p>
<p>While it was once widespread in its native range, its current distribution is limited due to habitat loss and over-collection. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as forests and stream valleys, often growing at altitudes between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Due to its restricted habitat and declining population, Acer subintegrum is considered endangered and is protected in several regions.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to preserve this rare and ecologically significant species.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer subintegrum is a decorative maple tree known for its vibrant foliage and unique growth patterns.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or softwood cuttings, with the latter being more reliable for maintaining specific cultivar traits. The growth cycle of Acer subintegrum includes a period of rapid growth in spring, followed by a rest period in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Fertilization in early spring with a balanced fertilizer and annual pruning to shape the tree and remove dead branches are essential for its health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or leaf spot, which can be managed with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with plants like lavender or ornamental grasses can enhance its aesthetic appeal and improve garden biodiversity.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer subintegrum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>It attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies with its showy flowers and provides nectar and pollen. The tree acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and supporting a wide range of organisms. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the soil and reducing runoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, it contributes to the overall ecological balance by improving air quality and offering habitat for numerous species.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer subintegrum is a decorative maple species primarily valued for its ornamental use in landscaping and horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit.</p>
<p>While it is not commonly used in culinary applications, its leaves can be used in traditional teas in certain regions. In medicinal practices, it has been explored for potential anti-inflammatory properties, though research is limited. Industrially, it contributes to local economies through the sale of plants and ornamental materials.</p>
<p>Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and beauty in regions where it is native, often featured in local gardens and public spaces.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer subintegrum has a variety of cultivars and hybrids that are prized for their ornamental value and adaptability.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Crimson King' and 'Autumn Flame,' known for their striking fall color and compact growth habit. Hybrids of Acer subintegrum are often created to enhance traits such as disease resistance and seasonal color display. These plants hold significant horticultural importance due to their ability to thrive in a range of climates and their aesthetic appeal in landscaping.</p>
<p>They are widely used in gardens and public spaces for their visual impact and seasonal interest.</p>
