                <h1>Acer subintegrum</h1>
<p>Acer subintegrum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that change color with the seasons, often displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow in autumn. The tree typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 meters, with a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.</p>
<p>The plant prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular ornamental species in gardens and landscapes.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer subintegrum has leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a moderate size ranging from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, turning vibrant red or orange in the fall. The stem is slender with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age, and it grows upright with a moderate growth rate. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, arranged in racemes, which are primarily wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>The fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule, which disperses by wind, allowing the seeds to travel several meters from the parent plant.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer subintegrum is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of central China, specifically in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>Although its native range is limited, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including North America and Europe, where it is grown in botanical gardens and private collections. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically found in shaded forest understories. This species grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, where it tolerates cool temperatures and high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited population, Acer subintegrum is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer subintegrum is a striking ornamental maple known for its vibrant foliage and elegant form.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or hardwood cuttings, with seeds requiring stratification for successful germination. The growth cycle of this plant includes a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires regular watering, though it is somewhat drought-tolerant once established. Fertilization in early spring and pruning to maintain shape are recommended, while it is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or scale insects.</p>
<p>Companion planting with hostas or ferns can enhance its aesthetic appeal in a woodland garden.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer subintegrum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecosystem pollination. It acts as a companion plant in mixed forests, enhancing biodiversity and soil health. The tree also plays a role in erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and supporting a wide range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer subintegrum is a lesser-known species of maple that has limited direct culinary use but is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its leaves and seeds have been explored for potential medicinal properties, though research is still in early stages. While not widely used in industrial applications, it contributes to local biodiversity and ecosystem health. In some regions, it holds cultural significance as a symbol of resilience and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Overall, its primary role remains ecological and aesthetic rather than economic or culinary.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer subintegrum has a variety of cultivars that are highly valued in horticulture for their unique foliage and ornamental qualities.</p>
<p>Popular cultivars include 'Variegatum' and 'Atrovirens', which are known for their striking variegated leaves and compact growth habit. The species has also been hybridized with other maple species, leading to the development of several hybrid varieties that exhibit enhanced hardiness and visual appeal. These hybrids are often used in landscape design due to their adaptability and aesthetic value.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer subintegrum and its cultivars and hybrids play an important role in ornamental horticulture, contributing to the diversity of garden plants.</p>
