<p>Amauropelta patula, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as India, China, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20 to 40 centimeters in length.
