                    <h1>Azolla microphylla</h1>
<p>Azolla microphylla, commonly known as water clover, is a floating aquatic fern belonging to the Azollaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, overlapping leaves that form a dense, mat-like structure on the water surface. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with the cyanobacterium Anabaena azollae, which fixes atmospheric nitrogen, providing essential nutrients to the plant. Azolla microphylla thrives in shallow, freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth rate makes it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts.</p>
