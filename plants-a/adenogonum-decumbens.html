                <h1>Adenogonum decumbens</h1>
<p>Adenogonum decumbens, commonly known as the creeping adenogonum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Adenogonum decumbens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenogonum decumbens has leaves that are elliptical in shape, opposite in arrangement, and vary in size from 2 to 5 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and slightly hairy surfaces.</p>
<p>Its stem is prostrate, creeping along the ground, with a smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. The flowers are small, clustered in umbels, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, helping the plant anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogonum decumbens is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Uganda.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. This plant is commonly associated with humid lowland forests and is sometimes seen in secondary vegetation. It has also been reported in parts of Southeast Asia, though its presence there is less documented.</p>
<p>Adenogonum decumbens is known for its climbing habit and is used traditionally in some African communities for medicinal purposes.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenogonum decumbens was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become a problematic invasive species, outcompeting native plants in various habitats. Its spread has been facilitated by its ability to thrive in a range of soil types and its rapid growth rate.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local ecosystems.</p>
