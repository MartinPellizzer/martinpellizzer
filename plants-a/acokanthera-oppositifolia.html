                <h1>Acokanthera oppositifolia</h1>
<p>Acokanthera oppositifolia, commonly known as the poison arrow tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. The plant is notable for its toxic sap, which contains cardiac glycosides and has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for poisoning arrows. Its fruits are woody capsules that contain seeds, and the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in cultivation but remains an important species in ecological and medicinal studies.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acokanthera oppositifolia has leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, opposite in arrangement, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, measuring approximately 5-10 cm in length.</p>
<p>The stem is woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically grayish-brown in color, and it exhibits a bushy growth pattern. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, blooming during the dry season, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. The fruit is a fleshy, red berry that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil.</p>
