                    <h1>Alaticaulia draconis</h1>
<p>Alaticaulia draconis, commonly known as the dragon's wing plant, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from underground sources.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Alaticaulia draconis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
