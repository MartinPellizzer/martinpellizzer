                    <h1>Astragalus xylorrhizus</h1>
<p>Astragalus xylorrhizus, commonly known as the sand milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor and drought-prone soils. Its trifoliate leaves and pod-like fruits are typical of the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>Astragalus xylorrhizus plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
