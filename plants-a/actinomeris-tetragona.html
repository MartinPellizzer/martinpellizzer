                <h1>Actinomeris tetragona</h1>
<p>Actinomeris tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled thornapple, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many toxic and ornamental species. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink in color. Its leaves are opposite and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinomeris tetragona has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green color.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and erect, with a smooth, pale green bark that becomes slightly woody with age. Its small, white flowers are arranged in terminal clusters, blooming in spring, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in loose, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinomeris tetragona is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly in the coastal regions of North and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. This plant is commonly found in dune environments and other coastal habitats. It plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its distribution is closely tied to the unique ecological conditions of the coastal plains.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinomeris tetragona was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as accidental transport via contaminated soil or equipment.</p>
<p>It has established itself in disturbed environments, including roadsides and urban areas. The plant's ability to thrive in poor soil conditions contributes to its successful spread. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
<p>However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied.</p>
