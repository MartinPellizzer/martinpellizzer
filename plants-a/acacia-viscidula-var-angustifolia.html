                        <h1>Acacia viscidula var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Acacia viscidula var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin, which gives the plant its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which are typically visited by birds and insects. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and high temperatures.</p>
<p>The resinous exudate has been used by Indigenous Australians for various purposes, including as a natural adhesive and in traditional medicine.</p>
