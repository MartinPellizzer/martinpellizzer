                        <h1>Acacia huberi</h1>
<p>Acacia huberi, commonly known as the desert acacia, is a shrub native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, feathery leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that access groundwater.</p>
<p>Acacia huberi plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia huberi is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in savannas and shrublands. This species is well adapted to dry climates and can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
<p>Acacia huberi is also known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia huberi was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It was brought in for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions. This plant is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It has become naturalized in several areas, spreading through seed dispersal by wind and animals.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and competition with native flora.</p>
