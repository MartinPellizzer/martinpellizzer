                    <h1>Acacia huberi</h1>
<p>Acacia huberi, commonly known as the desert acacia, is a shrub native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, feathery leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that access groundwater.</p>
<p>Acacia huberi plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
