                <h1>Aegilops campicola</h1>
<p>Aegilops campicola, commonly known as the flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions.</p>
<p>Aegilops campicola has been studied for its potential in agricultural and ecological contexts due to its resilience and hardiness.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegilops campicola has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear in shape, alternate in arrangement, and typically range from 5 to 15 cm in length, with a bluish-green color.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical, smooth, and slightly hairy, growing upright with a branching pattern near the base. Its flowers are small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets, blooming in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through dehiscence, and the seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the soil surface.</p>
