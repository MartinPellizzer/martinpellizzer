                        <h1>Acanthocladus microphyllus</h1>
<p>Acanthocladus microphyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acanthocladus, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae) and is characterized by its small, strap-like leaves that are densely packed along the stems. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in structures called sori. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on fern evolution and ecological adaptation.</p>
