                <h1>Acianthera quadriserrata</h1>
<p>Acianthera quadriserrata, commonly known as the four-toothed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, while its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its unique floral structure, which includes four serrated lobes on the lip, giving it its scientific name.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acianthera quadriserrata has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, cylindrical, and slightly hairy, with a reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers as the plant matures. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming during the summer months and pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, anchoring the plant in moist, well-drained soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera quadriserrata is primarily native to Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country. This orchid typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the Andean foothills. It is commonly found in cloud forests and montane habitats.</p>
<p>Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones in Ecuador.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acianthera quadriserrata was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, making it suitable for regions with high rainfall. This plant is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as forest edges, rocky outcrops, and along stream banks. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activities like horticulture and landscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has become a common species in many regions where it is not native.</p>
