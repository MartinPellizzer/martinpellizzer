                    <h1>Amorphophallus barthlottii</h1>
<p>Amorphophallus barthlottii, commonly known as the giant swamp taro, is a large, herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It features a massive, underground corm that can grow up to 2 meters in height, supporting a broad, arrowhead-shaped leaf. The plant produces a striking, spadix inflorescence that resembles a phallic shape, which is why it is also called the "corpse flower" due to its strong, unpleasant odor. It thrives in humid, swampy environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its unique reproductive structures and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
