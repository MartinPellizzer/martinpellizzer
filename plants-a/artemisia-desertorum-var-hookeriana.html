                    <h1>Artemisia desertorum var. hookeriana</h1>
<p>Artemisia desertorum var. hookeriana, commonly known as Hooker's sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-green foliage and small, yellowish-gray flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, semi-desert environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Hooker's sage also has a long history of traditional use by Indigenous peoples for medicinal and ceremonial purposes.</p>
