                <h1>Acronia dukei</h1>
<p>Acronia dukei, commonly known as the Duke's acronia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Acronia dukei has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acronia dukei has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elongated, serrated leaflets that are typically green in color and range in size from 5 to 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and slightly woody, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that develops shallow fissures as the plant matures. Its small, clustered flowers are white with yellow stamens, blooming in late spring and early summer, and are pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapted to absorb moisture from the soil in its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia dukei is primarily native to the highlands of western Africa, specifically in countries such as Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded forest environments at elevations between 500 and 1,500 meters above sea level. This species is commonly found in the understory of tropical rainforests, where it benefits from the humid climate and nutrient-rich soil. Acronia dukei plays a significant role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various insect species.</p>
<p>However, due to deforestation and habitat loss, its distribution has become increasingly restricted in recent decades.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acronia dukei was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.</p>
<p>It has been observed in regions with temperate climates, particularly in the eastern United States. This plant has shown a preference for disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to outcompete native species.</p>
<p>However, further research is needed to fully understand its ecological impact.</p>
