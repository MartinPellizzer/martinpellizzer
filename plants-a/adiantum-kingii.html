                <h1>Adiantum kingii</h1>
<p>Adiantum kingii, commonly known as the King's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Adiantum kingii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum kingii has fern-like leaves that are triangular in shape, arranged in a bipinnate pattern, with a delicate, lace-like appearance.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically a vibrant green, though they may turn brown at the edges when dry. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a smooth, light green bark that grows from the base upward. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, appearing in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The fruit is a dark brown, spore-bearing capsule that disperses spores by wind, and the roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in moist, shaded environments.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum kingii is primarily native to New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in areas with high humidity and shade. This fern thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often seen growing along stream banks or in rocky crevices. Its native range is limited to specific regions within New Guinea, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, Adiantum kingii is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum kingii was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was first recorded in the 1980s and has since become established in several regions. The plant is commonly found in coastal and subcoastal areas, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often seen growing on cliffs or in rock crevices.</p>
<p>Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to spread and compete with native species.</p>
