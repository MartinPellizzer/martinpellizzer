                <h1>Adenia venenata</h1>
<p>Adenia venenata, commonly known as the poison apple or black beauty, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Australia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, featuring glossy, dark green leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces fleshy, red or yellow berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its bark and leaves contain various alkaloids, which have been studied for potential medicinal properties.</p>
<p>Adenia venenata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological importance in its native habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adenia venenata has compound, alternate leaves that are pinnate with lanceolate to ovate leaflets, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, and typically have a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside.</p>
<p>The stem is cylindrical with a rough, ridged texture and a brownish-gray bark that peels in thin layers. Its flowers are large, showy, and typically white or cream in color, with a complex structure featuring five petals and numerous stamens; they bloom during the dry season and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and extensive, helping to anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia venenata is primarily native to Central African Republic, Chad, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan-South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Yemen.</p>
<p>This plant is found in a variety of habitats across these regions, including savannas, woodlands, and rocky areas. It is well adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native range. Adenia venenata is commonly encountered in dry and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its distribution spans a wide geographic area across sub-Saharan Africa and parts of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adenia venenata was mainly introduced to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is considered an environmental weed in certain regions of the country. The plant spreads through its seeds, which can be dispersed by wind, water, or animals. It thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is often targeted for control in natural areas.</p>
