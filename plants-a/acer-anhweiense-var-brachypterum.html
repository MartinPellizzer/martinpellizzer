                <h1>Acer anhweiense var. brachypterum</h1>
<p>Acer anhweiense var. brachypterum, commonly known as the short-winged maple, is a deciduous tree native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five lobes. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acer anhweiense var. brachypterum has palmately compound leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, arranged alternately along the stems, with a moderate size and a bright green color during the growing season.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and somewhat woody, with a smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, with a simple structure and wind as the primary pollination method. The fruit is a samara, consisting of two winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acer anhweiense var. brachypterum is a rare maple species native to the mountainous regions of southern China, specifically in the provinces of Hubei, Sichuan, and Hunan.</p>
<p>Its current distribution is limited to a few isolated populations in these areas, where it grows in humid, temperate forests. This variant thrives in shady, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acer anhweiense var. brachypterum is a rare and ornamental maple species that thrives in temperate climates.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through seeds or semi-hardwood cuttings, with the latter offering faster results. The growth cycle involves a period of active growth in spring and early summer, followed by dormancy in winter.</p>
<p>It prefers well-drained, loamy soil and regular watering, though it should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings. Fertilization with a balanced NPK fertilizer in early spring and light pruning after flowering helps maintain its shape and health. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Companion planting with ferns or hostas can enhance its aesthetic appeal and promote a balanced garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acer anhweiense var. brachypterum is a deciduous tree that provides food and shelter for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals.</p>
<p>Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the health of local ecosystems. The tree also acts as a companion plant in forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and soil stability. Its deep root system helps prevent erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing soil on slopes.</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers ecological benefits by improving air quality and supporting a wide range of flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acer anhweiense var. brachypterum is a lesser-known maple species with limited direct culinary use, though its leaves may be used in traditional herbal teas.</p>
<p>It has potential medicinal applications due to its high concentration of flavonoids and antioxidants, which may support immune function and reduce inflammation. In industrial contexts, its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain, making it suitable for furniture and decorative crafts. Culturally, it symbolizes resilience and adaptability in certain regional traditions.</p>
<p>However, its applications remain largely underexplored compared to more widely studied maple species.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acer anhweiense var. brachypterum has several popular cultivars that are highly valued in horticulture, such as 'Crimson Sentinel' and 'Red Sentinel,' known for their vibrant fall color and compact growth habits.</p>
<p>This species also serves as a parent in various hybrids, contributing to the development of maple varieties with enhanced ornamental traits. Its unique foliage and adaptability make it a significant choice for gardeners seeking shade trees and ornamental plants. The cultivars and hybrids derived from this species are widely appreciated for their aesthetic appeal and resilience in different climates.</p>
<p>Overall, Acer anhweiense var. brachypterum plays an important role in expanding the diversity of maple trees in horticultural landscapes.</p>
