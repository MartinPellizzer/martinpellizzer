                    <h1>Alliaria macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Alliaria macrocarpa, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a distinctive white pubescence. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a smooth, elongated seed pod that splits open to release tiny, triangular seeds.</p>
<p>Garlic mustard is known for its strong garlic-like odor, which comes from the sulfur compounds in its leaves and flowers.</p>
