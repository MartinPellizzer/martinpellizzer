                    <h1>Androsace pleiocarpa var. elongata</h1>
<p>Androsace pleiocarpa var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated rosebay, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological importance in mountainous ecosystems.</p>
<p>The varietal form 'elongata' is distinguished by its longer stems and more extended growth habit compared to the typical variety.</p>
