                    <h1>Agrostis stolonizans</h1>
<p>Agrostis stolonizans, commonly known as Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Africa, and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with stolons and rhizomes that allow it to spread rapidly and form dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in a variety of soil types, making it a common lawn and erosion control plant.</p>
<p>Its ability to regenerate from rhizomes makes it resilient to mowing and environmental stress.</p>
