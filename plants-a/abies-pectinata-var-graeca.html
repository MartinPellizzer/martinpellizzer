                        <h1>Abies pectinata var. graeca</h1>
<p>Abies pectinata var. graeca, commonly known as the Greek fir, is a variant of the silver fir native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are slightly twisted. The cones are typically reddish-brown and hang downward, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil, often growing at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in both horticulture and natural habitats.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies pectinata var. graeca is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe, particularly in the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is found in countries such as Albania, Kosovo, Montenegro, and parts of Greece. This variety thrives in high-altitude coniferous forests, often growing at elevations between 1,200 and 2,500 meters. It is adapted to cool, moist climates with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant is an important component of the local ecosystem and is often found in association with other conifer species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Abies pectinata var. graeca was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, particularly in regions of Eastern Europe and parts of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>It thrives in elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters where there is sufficient sunlight and moderate precipitation. This variety is often found in mixed forests alongside other coniferous species such as Pinus and Fagus. Its introduction has been primarily for ornamental purposes and reforestation efforts due to its attractive foliage and ecological benefits.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation.</p>
