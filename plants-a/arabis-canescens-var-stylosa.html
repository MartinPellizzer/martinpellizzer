                    <h1>Arabis canescens var. stylosa</h1>
<p>Arabis canescens var. stylosa, commonly known as the silverleaf rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
