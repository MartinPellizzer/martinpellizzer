<p>Axinaea fernando-cabiesii, commonly known as the Fernando Cabiesi's axinaea, is a rare and endemic fern species found in the cloud forests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves with a distinctive venation pattern. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, clinging to tree trunks and branches in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including small, clustered flowers, are adapted to pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragility, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
