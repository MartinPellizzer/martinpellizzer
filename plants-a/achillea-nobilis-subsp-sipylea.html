                <h1>Achillea nobilis subsp. sipylea</h1>
<p>Achillea nobilis subsp.</p>
<p>sipylea, commonly known as the Sipylea yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright, branched stems and basal leaves that are feather-like and gray-green in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, flat-topped clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its aromatic foliage and long flowering period contribute to its ornamental value.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea nobilis subsp.</p>
<p>sipylea has leaves that are lance-shaped, with a gray-green color and a rough, hairy texture, arranged alternately along the stem. The stem is upright, somewhat woody at the base, with a reddish-brown bark and a growth pattern that is typically clump-forming.</p>
<p>The flowers are composite, consisting of ray florets in a flat, showy head, typically in shades of white to pale yellow, blooming from late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small achene, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and attached pappus.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea nobilis subsp.</p>
<p>sipylea is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in Greece and Turkey. Its current distribution includes parts of the Mediterranean Basin, where it thrives in rocky and calcareous soils.</p>
<p>This species prefers sunny, well-drained environments such as grasslands, slopes, and rocky outcrops. It typically grows at altitudes ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as threatened in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea nobilis subsp.</p>
<p>sipylea is a hardy perennial that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a versatile addition to gardens. It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in the fall, ensuring easy expansion of the plant.</p>
<p>The growth cycle involves a dormant period in winter, with active growth and flowering occurring in late spring to summer. For optimal growth, it requires moderate watering and benefits from a balanced fertilizer applied in early spring. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or powdery mildew, which can be managed with proper care.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or yarrow enhances its ornamental value and promotes a healthy garden ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
