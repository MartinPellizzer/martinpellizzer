                    <h1>Atriplex sibirica</h1>
<p>Atriplex sibirica, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a perennial shrub native to the temperate regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, lobed leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating called farina, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common weed in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Atriplex sibirica is also known for its ability to accumulate minerals, making it a potential plant for phytoremediation.</p>
