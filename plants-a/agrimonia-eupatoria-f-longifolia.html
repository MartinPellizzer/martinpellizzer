                    <h1>Agrimonia eupatoria f. longifolia</h1>
<p>Agrimonia eupatoria f. longifolia, commonly known as long-leaved agrimony, is a botanical variant of the agrimony plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, woodlands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves and flowers are used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The varietal form 'longifolia' distinguishes it from the typical agrimony by its longer, more slender foliage.</p>
