                <h1>Acrostichum stelligerum</h1>
<p>Acrostichum stelligerum, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fibrous roots are adapted to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion along shorelines.</p>
<p>Acrostichum stelligerum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrostichum stelligerum has large, broad, lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes silvery underside.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and upright, with a smooth, slender bark that is typically greenish-brown in color. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, and they are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds through wind, and the plant has a fibrous root system that helps anchor it in sandy or coastal soils.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum stelligerum is primarily native to the Indo-Pacific region, including parts of Southeast Asia, the Philippines, and northern Australia.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal and estuarine environments, often found in brackish water areas. This plant is commonly associated with mangrove ecosystems and can tolerate varying salinity levels. It plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
<p>Its distribution is largely restricted to tropical and subtropical coastal zones.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrostichum stelligerum was mainly introduced to coastal and estuarine environments along the eastern coast of Australia.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in salt marshes and tidal flats where it thrives in brackish water conditions. This plant was introduced to these areas as part of ecological restoration efforts to stabilize shorelines and improve habitat for native species. Its rapid growth and tolerance to varying salinity levels make it a valuable, though sometimes invasive, species in these ecosystems.</p>
<p>However, its spread can sometimes outcompete native vegetation, raising concerns about its long-term ecological impact.</p>
