                    <h1>Actaea brachypetala var. alba</h1>
<p>Actaea brachypetala var. alba, commonly known as white bugbane, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features tall, slender stems that bear large, white, umbellate inflorescences, which are showy and attract pollinators. The plant has palmately compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, and it thrives in moist, shady environments. Its flowers are typically followed by red or orange berries that persist into winter.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its pale white flowers, which contrast with the darker foliage of other Actaea species.</p>
