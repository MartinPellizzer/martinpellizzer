<p>Alisma polyspermum, commonly known as the water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and thrive in muddy or aquatic soils.</p>
<p>Alisma polyspermum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
