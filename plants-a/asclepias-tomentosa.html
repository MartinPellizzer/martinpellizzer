                    <h1>Asclepias tomentosa</h1>
<p>Asclepias tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the eastern and central United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fuzzy, gray-green leaves and clusters of pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. Its unique flower structure, with specialized pollen sacs, aids in pollination by specific insects.</p>
<p>Asclepias tomentosa plays a vital role in supporting local ecosystems and is a key species for conservation efforts.</p>
