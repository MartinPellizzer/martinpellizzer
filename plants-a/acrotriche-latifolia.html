                <h1>Acrotriche latifolia</h1>
<p>Acrotriche latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf acrotriche, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and lanceolate, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acrotriche latifolia has simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are usually broad and dark green, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a rough, fissured bark that is grayish-brown in color. Its small, white flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, bloom during the spring, and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to arid conditions by absorbing moisture efficiently.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotriche latifolia is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and undergrowth. This plant is commonly found in the Amazon Basin and adjacent lowland areas. It prefers well-drained soils and is often associated with humid climates.</p>
<p>Its native distribution is largely restricted to these specific ecological zones within the continent.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Acrotriche latifolia was mainly introduced to areas with sandy soils and coastal environments, particularly in regions experiencing habitat disturbance.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed soils along roadsides, dunes, and agricultural fields. This plant has become established in several states along the southeastern United States. Its introduction is often associated with human activity, such as land development and transportation infrastructure.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it has spread beyond its original range in some areas.</p>
