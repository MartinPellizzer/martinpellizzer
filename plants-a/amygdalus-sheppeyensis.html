                    <h1>Amygdalus sheppeyensis</h1>
<p>Amygdalus sheppeyensis, commonly known as Sheppey almond, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the UK.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal habitats, characterized by its small, pale green leaves and showy white flowers. The plant produces small, hard nuts that are encased in a thick, woody shell. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is one of the rarest almond species in the world.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique botanical species.</p>
