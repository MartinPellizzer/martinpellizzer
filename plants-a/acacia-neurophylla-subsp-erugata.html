                <h1>Acacia neurophylla subsp. erugata</h1>
<p>Acacia neurophylla subsp.</p>
<p>erugata, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and phyllodes that are narrow and linear.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in compact spikes, which are typically arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a common adaptation in Acacia species to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to salty and sandy soils, making it a resilient plant in coastal environments.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Acacia neurophylla subsp.</p>
<p>erugata has compound leaves that are bipinnate, with small, oval leaflets arranged in pairs along slender petioles, giving the foliage a delicate, feathery appearance. The stems are woody, with a rough, fissured bark that is typically greyish-brown in color, and they grow in a shrub-like form with a dense, compact habit.</p>
<p>The flowers are yellow, arranged in cylindrical inflorescences, and consist of small, pea-like blooms that bloom during the summer months, relying on wind for pollination. The fruit is a pod that splits open to release small, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind due to their light weight and small size.</p>
<p>The roots are deep and extensive, helping the plant access water from deeper soil layers, making it well adapted to arid environments.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Acacia neurophylla subsp.</p>
<p>erugata is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Western Australia. Its native range includes parts of the Goldfields and Great Sandy Desert, where it thrives in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Currently, the species is found primarily in the Pilbara and Gascoyne regions, though its distribution has been reduced due to habitat loss. It typically grows in open habitats such as spinifex plains and sand plains, often at altitudes between 100 and 300 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>The conservation status of this subspecies is listed as vulnerable, primarily due to threats from land clearing and climate change.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acacia neurophylla subsp.</p>
<p>erugata is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub native to Australia, commonly cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. It can be propagated through seeds or cuttings, with seeds requiring a cold stratification period to break dormancy.</p>
<p>The plant has a slow growth cycle, reaching maturity over several years, and thrives in well-drained soils with moderate watering. Regular fertilization during the growing season and light pruning to maintain shape are recommended. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may occasionally attract aphids or root rot if overwatered.</p>
<p>Companion planting with native grasses or flowering plants can enhance its ecological role and aesthetic appeal.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Acacia neurophylla subsp.</p>
<p>erugata is an important plant in arid and semi-arid ecosystems, providing food and shelter for a variety of wildlife. It attracts pollinators such as bees and birds with its nectar-rich flowers and serves as a food source for herbivores like kangaroos and rabbits.</p>
<p>The plant acts as a nitrogen fixer, improving soil fertility and supporting the growth of other vegetation. It also functions as a companion plant, enhancing the survival of neighboring species in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Additionally, its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, stabilizing the landscape and promoting ecological resilience.</p>

<h2>Uses and Applications</h2>
<p>Acacia neurophylla subsp.</p>
<p>erugata is a shrub native to Australia that has various uses and applications. Its wood is valued in the timber industry for its durability and workability, contributing to local economies.</p>
<p>The plant has traditional medicinal uses by Indigenous communities, where it is used to treat ailments such as skin infections and inflammation. It also plays a role in cultural practices, symbolizing resilience and connection to the land.</p>
<p>Additionally, it provides habitat and food for native wildlife, making it important for ecological balance.</p>

<h2>Varieties, Cultivars and Hybrids</h2>
<p>Acacia neurophylla subsp.</p>
<p>erugata has several popular cultivars, including 'Cocopah' and 'Dawn Mist', which are prized for their ornamental value and adaptability. The species is also involved in hybridization with other Acacia species, leading to the development of unique forms with enhanced horticultural traits.</p>
<p>These hybrids often exhibit improved cold tolerance and floral display, making them more suitable for a range of garden environments. Cultivars and hybrids of this subspecies are widely used in landscaping and conservation efforts due to their hardiness and aesthetic appeal. Overall, Acacia neurophylla subsp.</p>
<p>erugata plays a significant role in horticultural diversity and ecological restoration projects.</p>
