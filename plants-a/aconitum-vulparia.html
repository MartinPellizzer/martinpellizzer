                <h1>Aconitum vulparia</h1>
<p>Aconitum vulparia, commonly known as wolf's bane, is a striking perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae) and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces showy, spurred petals and has palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed. Aconitum vulparia contains potent toxins, including alkaloids like aconitine, which make it highly poisonous to both humans and animals.</p>
<p>Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in gardens and requires careful handling.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aconitum vulparia has compound, doubly pinnate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a serrated edge, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is tall and erect, with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes rougher with age. Its flowers are showy and blue-violet, arranged in racemes, blooming from late summer to early autumn, and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are tuberous and fibrous, adapted for absorbing nutrients from the soil.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum vulparia is primarily native to Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia-Slovakia, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, NW.</p>
<p>Balkan Pen., Romania, Spain, and Switzerland. It is commonly found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks in these regions.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its distribution spans across much of Central and Western Europe.</p>
<p>It is a striking species with its tall, spiky inflorescences and is often found in naturalized habitats.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Aconitum vulparia was mainly introduced to Great Britain as an ornamental plant due to its striking blue or purple flowers and its historical association with the Victorian era's garden aesthetics.</p>
<p>It was commonly cultivated in gardens and public spaces for its visual appeal, despite its toxicity. However, its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to spread beyond cultivated areas and compete with native plant species. The plant's presence in Great Britain is now considered an invasive species in some regions, prompting efforts to control its spread.</p>
<p>Its introduction highlights the ecological and health risks associated with non-native plant species.</p>
