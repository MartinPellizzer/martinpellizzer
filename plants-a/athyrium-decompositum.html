                    <h1>Athyrium decompositum</h1>
<p>Athyrium decompositum, commonly known as the dissected maidenhair fern, is a striking member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a delicate, almost lace-like appearance. Native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, this fern thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in woodland settings.</p>
<p>The plant's unique leaf structure and elegant form make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
