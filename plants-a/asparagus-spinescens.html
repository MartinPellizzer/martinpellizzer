                    <h1>Asparagus spinescens</h1>
<p>Asparagus spinescens, commonly known as the spiny asparagus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in small, sharp spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible, needle-like shoots that are harvested for culinary use. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with numerous small leaflets that help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Asparagus spinescens thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
