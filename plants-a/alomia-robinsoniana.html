<p>Alomia robinsoniana, commonly known as the Robinson's alomia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, Alomia robinsoniana is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
