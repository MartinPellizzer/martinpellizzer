<p>Aspidium floridanum, commonly known as the Florida water fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in wetlands. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Aspidium floridanum plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
