                    <h1>Apoballis</h1>
<p>Apoballis, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap. The plants typically have opposite, oval-shaped leaves and produce showy, tubular flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red. Apoballis species are often found in dry, rocky habitats and are adapted to arid conditions.</p>
<p>The sap of these plants contains toxic compounds, making them unpalatable to most herbivores.</p>
