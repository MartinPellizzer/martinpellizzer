<p>Airopsis setacea, commonly known as the bristly sea lettuce, is a green algae belonging to the family Ulvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, ribbon-like thallus that is covered with short, stiff bristles. This species typically grows in shallow, rocky coastal areas where it can absorb nutrients from the surrounding water. Airopsis setacea thrives in marine environments and is often found in intertidal zones.</p>
<p>Its structure allows it to retain moisture and withstand wave action, making it well adapted to its habitat.</p>
