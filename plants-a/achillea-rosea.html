                <h1>Achillea rosea</h1>
<p>Achillea rosea, commonly known as the pink yarrow, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features feathery, aromatic leaves and flat, pink or red flower clusters that bloom in summer. The plant is characterized by its sturdy stems and showy composite flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its botanical name honors the Greek hero Achilles, who was said to have used it to treat wounds.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea rosea has leaves that are lance-shaped, serrated along the edges, and arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, hairy, and has a pale green to reddish-brown bark, growing in a clump-forming pattern. Its flowers are flat-topped clusters (called a corymb), consisting of small white to pinkish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and are pollinated primarily by insects. The fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus, and seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and form dense colonies.</p>

<h2>Natural Habitat and Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea rosea is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>While it was historically confined to its native range, it is now cultivated in some parts of Europe and North America as an ornamental plant. It thrives in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is commonly found in alpine meadows and grasslands. Achillea rosea typically grows at altitudes between 1,500 and 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is listed as a species of concern in some regions, though its conservation status remains uncertain.</p>

<h2>Growth and Cultivation</h2>
<p>Achillea rosea is a hardy perennial known for its delicate, pink-tinged flowers and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>It can be propagated through division in early spring or by sowing seeds in late summer. This plant has a biennial growth cycle, typically flowering in its second year before going dormant.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, especially during dry periods. Fertilize it lightly in early spring, and prune spent flowers to encourage new growth. It is generally resistant to pests and diseases but may attract aphids or powdery mildew in damp conditions.</p>
<p>Companion planting with lavender or thyme can enhance its fragrance and deter pests.</p>

<h2>Ecological Role</h2>
<p>Achillea rosea is a flowering plant that provides nectar and pollen, serving as a vital food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit offers shelter and habitat for small insects and birds. It acts as a companion plant, often growing well alongside other garden species to enhance biodiversity. Additionally, its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in stabilizing landscapes.</p>
<p>Achillea rosea also contributes to ecological benefits by supporting a wide range of wildlife and improving soil structure through its fibrous roots.</p>
