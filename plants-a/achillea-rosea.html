                <h1>Achillea rosea</h1>
<p>Achillea rosea, commonly known as the pink yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine, grayish-green hairs. Its flowers are typically pink or rose-colored, arranged in flat-topped clusters, and bloom from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>Achillea rosea is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and has a long history in traditional medicine.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea rosea has leaves that are lance-shaped, with a silvery-gray underside and a dark green upper surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stems are hairy, with a reddish-brown color and a creeping growth pattern that often forms a low-growing mat. Its flowers are composite, consisting of white ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, blooming in early summer and pollinated primarily by bees. The fruit is a dry, achene with a pappus that aids in wind dispersal, and the seeds are small and lightweight.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing the plant to spread and establish itself in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea rosea is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky slopes and gravelly soils. This plant is commonly found in countries like Spain, Italy, and Turkey. It is well adapted to the climate of these regions, with its drought-resistant properties.</p>
<p>Its native range reflects its historical association with Mediterranean ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea rosea was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has become naturalized in certain regions.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, wastelands, and forest margins. The plant is known for its showy pink or white flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through human activity, possibly as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems.</p>
