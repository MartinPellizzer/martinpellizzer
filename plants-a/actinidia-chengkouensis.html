                <h1>Actinidia chengkouensis</h1>
<p>Actinidia chengkouensis, commonly known as the Chengkou actinidia, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Actinidia.</p>
<p>It is native to China and is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically followed by edible berries. These berries are often used in traditional Chinese medicine and are valued for their nutritional content.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Actinidia chengkouensis has heart-shaped to ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside; the leaves are typically 5â€“10 cm in length and have a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The stem is slender and twining, with a reddish-brown bark that is smooth when young and develops shallow fissures with age. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, with separate male and female flowers on different plants, and they are pollinated by wind. The fruit is a small, yellowish berry that ripens in late summer, and the seeds are dispersed by birds and other animals.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to the moist, well-drained soils of its native habitat.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia chengkouensis is primarily native to China South-Central.</p>
<p>This species is found in the mountainous regions of Sichuan and Chongqing provinces. It thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. The plant is commonly found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>It is an important component of the local flora and is often associated with other endemic species in the region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Actinidia chengkouensis was mainly introduced to China, where it is native to the Sichuan province.</p>
<p>It is typically found in moist, shaded environments within mountainous regions. The plant is valued for its edible fruit, which is similar to kiwifruit in taste and nutritional content. Due to its unique characteristics, it has been cultivated in limited areas for agricultural and horticultural purposes.</p>
<p>However, its distribution remains relatively restricted compared to other Actinidia species.</p>
