                    <h1>Acacia detinens</h1>
<p>Acacia detinens, commonly known as the slender acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched structure and small, paired leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. Acacia detinens is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a waxy coating on its leaves to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
