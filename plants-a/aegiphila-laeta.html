                <h1>Aegiphila laeta</h1>
<p>Aegiphila laeta, commonly known as the silverleaf aegiphila, is a perennial shrub native to the Caribbean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>Aegiphila laeta is often found growing in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to coastal and inland habitats.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Aegiphila laeta has leaves that are lanceolate, with a smooth margin and a dark green, glossy upper surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is slender, woody, and has a rough, fissured bark that is typically reddish-brown in color. Its small, fragrant flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, with white petals and yellow stamens, blooming in spring and attracting insect pollinators like bees. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and shallow, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and aiding in water absorption.</p>
