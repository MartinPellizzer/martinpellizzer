                <h1>Achillea urumoffii</h1>
<p>Achillea urumoffii, commonly known as the Urumoff's yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and flat-topped clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowering period occurs in the summer months, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Achillea urumoffii has leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a silvery-gray underside and a dark green upper surface, arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The stem is upright, somewhat hairy, and has a reddish-brown bark that becomes smoother with age. The flowers are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers, blooming in late summer to early autumn and are primarily pollinated by insects. The fruit is a small achene enclosed in a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, helping the plant to spread and establish in various soil types.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea urumoffii is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, specifically Kazakhstan and southern Russia.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, rocky, and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This plant is commonly associated with steppe and semi-desert environments, where it adapts to harsh climatic conditions. Its distribution is limited to specific elevations, typically between 1,000 and 2,500 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native region.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Achillea urumoffii was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, particularly in Europe and parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it can thrive in full sun. The plant has been introduced as an ornamental due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature. However, it has shown potential as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
<p>Its distribution is now expanding beyond its original range, raising concerns among ecologists.</p>
