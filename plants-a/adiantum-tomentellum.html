<p>Adiantum tomentellum, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, bright green fronds that are often covered in a silvery, fuzzy coating, giving it its common name. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced by new growth.</p>
<p>Adiantum tomentellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
