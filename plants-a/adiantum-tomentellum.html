                <h1>Adiantum tomentellum</h1>
<p>Adiantum tomentellum, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, bright green fronds that are often covered in a silvery, fuzzy coating, giving it its common name. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced by new growth.</p>
<p>Adiantum tomentellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>

<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Adiantum tomentellum has fern-like leaves that are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and they are arranged alternately along the stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically small, ranging from 10 to 30 cm in length, and have a pale green color with a fuzzy, velvety texture on the underside. The stem is slender and upright, with a smooth, light green bark that grows in a compact, clumping pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are greenish in color, blooming in early spring, and are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, and the roots are fibrous and rhizomatous, aiding in the plant's clonal growth.</p>

<h2>Native Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum tomentellum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including parts of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky stream banks. This fern thrives in humid climates and is often associated with rich, organic soil. It is particularly common in the Appalachian region and the coastal plain areas.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for specific habitats, it is considered a relatively rare and localized species.</p>

<h2>Introduced Distribution</h2>
<p>Adiantum tomentellum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. This fern is known for its delicate, silvery-white undersides on its fronds. It has become naturalized in some parts of its introduced range, often thriving in disturbed or moist habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
